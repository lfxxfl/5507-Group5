it also focuses on the protagonists personal journeys and struggles rather than pushing a woke agenda although elements of wokeness are present its not the worst thing that has come out and is fairly entertaining

the main thing i appreciated about it is it is open to interpretation if you choose to see it under a woke lense you will find it dry on the other hand if a 3rd wave feminist sees this theyll might be concerned there were not enough points to scrutinize men under 

as margot said its a film for everyone it pushes in neither direction and shows how either side of can be detrimental right and wrong

no that wasnt the mesage they specifically said in the end that the kens will have as much power in barbieland as women have in real world which actually implies that its the real world that needs to have equality among the sexes so that it can be reflected in the real world it shouldnt be the other way around

2 852  you mention the same dialogue but you are saying it might be a joke or a haha moment its not that line is the message of gender equality dont know why would anyone take that as a funny moment

3 859  women truely have no power in the real world

real power might be an exaggeration by you but women certainly have very less power than men in the real world i am glad that you dont feel that in your life but for other millions of women the situation is pretty bad specially in other parts of the world for example where i am from i am torn to see that even as a guy

70,@GrimGatsby,19/9/2023,12:37:55,0,"i think you were looking at this movie from a very surface level skin deep perspective if you really analyze the dialogue character portrayals subtext in many of the speechessongs and how the barbieskens perceive their world youll come to see the movie is actually a parody on modern wokenessfeminist extremism and instead promotes real equality without having to tear down social constructs or rewrite gender roles to do it they did a very good job of writing the barbie world in a way that from a character development standpoint you could swap the kens out for women in the 20s50s and the barbies for privileged rich powerful entitled men and the message would be the same the whole point was to reverse the stereotypical roles men and women have had in history to help both genders empathize with each other and find some common ground instead of vilifying each other it also subtly pokes fun at the ideologies and agendas of modern feminist extremism 

ken is from a world where he and every other man is objectified and belittled the writers make it clear with a line in the movie that directly states the barbie society was built on the backs of the barbies barbies have all the positions of power and authority the only role the kens play is to be an accessory but as the main ken is exposed to the books about the patriarchy that show him a world of men being in charge he feels empowered for simply being a man and goes on to lead a movement back in barbie world where he and the other kens overthrow the matriarchy even though its ultimately at the expense of the barbies they accomplish exactly what the man hating feminist extremism of our world has been trying to accomplish but gender swapped so what do the barbies do they turn the kens into the male equivalent of pickme girls attack their self esteemself worth and set the rest of them against eachother so barbies are working against kens and kens are working against kens sound familiar women hate woman and men hate women its the one thing we can all agree on the line from the insufferable radical feminist anticapitalist daughter another parody on modern radical feminism who by the way ironically goes from wearing baggy clothes no make up  and having a generally a tomboyish look to literally wearing a very girly pretty pink dress with make up and jewelry towards the end of the movie

as for the main barbie shes a representation of the current status quo when it comes to modern day social standards for gender roles in the climax of the movie her self image is brought into question as the social norms of her world that once made her feel confident about her looks personality and place in society are repeatedly challenged and eventually dissolved when she tries to speak out against these changes shes ostracized and ultimately vilified by ken who after robbing her of her agency essentially asks her how it feels to be trivialized and disregarded just like he was its not fun is it then in the classic hit the road jack fashion ken goes on to toss all her stuff out of the window eventually the barbies get the power back from the kens but by that time the main barbie has became disillusioned with her place in this world seeing the flaws in the one sided society theyve been living in 

in the end of the movie when ruth whos obviously an allegory for god takes barbie away she explains in essence that being human is uncomfortable she doesnt specify a gender she basically states that humans invent ideologies and radical social standards out of fear and hate in order to cope with the discomfort of living in an socially underdeveloped society thats constantly picking itself apart over things as trivial as gender or race this movie is trying to dispel the notion that being a role model for woman in modern society has to mean being a strong independent glass ceiling breaking girl boss with no weaknesses or dependencies on men that youre contributing to the marginalization and oppression of woman whenever you acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses that make men and women unique from each other that a woman embracing her femininity is weak and a man embracing his masculinity is toxic

120,@odinakaugwu6671,10/9/2023,22:30:19,1,"i enjoyed the film very much although i understand the perspective you presented on the messaging and the apparent feministlean the movie had i couldnt help interpret this to be more satire than genuine critique

i thought the movie presented the world through the lens of a hyperfeminist all men are dumb and incompetent  in an ideal world women control everything yet did not itself believe or celebrate these ideas

this is particularly evident when theres the more mature encounters between barbie and ruth handler  even between ken and folks he interacted with in the real world

on kens side although he discovered greater appreciation for masculinity he also quickly learns that just being a man isnt enough noone was going to let him operate on patients without a surgical certification and he would not be offered a job in a highpaying position without the appropriate qualification

meanwhile when barbie speaks to the insufferable teen ans her mom theres the obvious bias against men  capitalism and an undertone of female oppression from the patriarchy yet when she speaks with ruth theres much less of that and the conversation is steered in a much more enlightened mature direction ruth literally admits that patriarchy isnt real but is a made up entity created to deal with the discomforts of life

why this movie strikes me so much more as a satirical take on feminism than an empowering polemic is in its lack of nuance in portraying the male oppressors and female victims 

both factions were painted as largely incompetent requiring the validation of the other fragile and easily programmable 

barbie at the end of it decides she doesnt want to be that anymore but rather be part of the people that create meaning not the thing that is made

how often do we find that extremists at both ends of the gender war can scarcely synthesise creative critical thought but rather regurgitate ideology stemming mostly from sentiment and often lacking in real substance

in my opinion barbie was having existential dread with the status quo and was also oblivious to kens quasihidden feelings of worthlessness not unlike how things were for women traditionally in american history before the sufferage

barbie found the patriarchy terrible ken found the matriarchy terrible we find out both barbie  ken also hate the matriarchy  patriarchy respectively  decide that the best way to move forward is to begin to forge a path toward equal rights while remaining open to existential feelings 

i thought that was a good lesson 

with that said i do agree that there was a significant amount of woke oriented humour  watching the sexism between the dolls just wasnt enjoyable

i was looking forward to more of a live action toy story or something when i heard they were doing a barbie movie  that it was geared toward all ages the story instead teaches gretas political views which in my opinion isnt what i thought i was signing up for

ken is portraying two stereotypes in my opinion

 before he went to the real world he was the blond sidekick to the main character he lacked personality and was just there to look pretty and pine over the main character sounds familiar look at most bond girls ken is portrayed the way most women are portrayed in male directed movies

then after he brought the patriarchy to barbieland hes acting all macho showing his muscles and acting suave its the stereotype for masculine men its the way most male main characters are portrayed in movies by male directors

in the end ken shows his emotions to barbie and she comforts him and basically lets him know that he is kenough he should be his own person and shouldnt let his value be dependable on someone else

the kens show the history of women 100 years ago women couldnt vote women were expected to be an obedient wife a good mother and nothing more today there is still no mention in the constitution than men and women are equal today women are paid less than men for the same job even the dumbest men can be president but not women the movie doesnt say its awful to be a women it just says it is difficult 

like the women in the real world the kens believed their only purpose was to be a companion of a barbie thats why they are dumb they spend their time waiting to be seen by a barbie they are jealous of each other if they are more handsome or more cool because they will lose barbies attention like women in the real world were in the past and sometime still are today then they realise they are independant people too they can even have their own carreer

738,@Shwammi,7/8/2023,6:35:33,8,"edit i subscribed to your channel watched a couple other vids and am hooked  blazingly  interesting    i just happen to disagree on barbie  

i absolutely loved the barbie  movie  its profound on so many levels  while watching the first time through my mind was flipping in and out of different ways to interpret the story  intentionally implied by the creators and perhaps other metaphorical ways to perceive it that were all in my head   all highly relevant and extremely interesting  and all that mind  soul stuff was hilariously highlighted punctuated by humor  humor that didnt interrupt to diffuse the message but emphasized  so fabulous absolutely over the top  exceeded all my expectations

im a gen x male  ive seen it three times  it is one of my absolute favorite movies ever because it directly addresses fundamental issues in society  and does so with such uninhibited glee   watching margot and ryans playful love of their roles is delightful   id recommend this movie to almost anyone  just about every single female ive ever known or met and to any male who has any sense of selfawareness and humor   if one is inherently reactionary they may reject it entirely  

i had one older buddy a curmudgeonly maga boomer who said it was the worst movie hes ever seen  unfortunately he took his grandkids and sat with his 7 year old son and imparted his hatred of the movie   luckily his granddaughters sat away from him and loved it so darned much  as margot robbie said in an interview greta marvelously trojan horsed so much into this film   it will piss off some who feel threatened in a fragile world  it delights and empowers others     if you are one it pissed off and wonder why others loved it  maybe think about why   and watch some probarbie youtube content that includes margot robbie ryan gosling and greta gerwig  they made this movie and i believe one can take their words at face value  i do  enjoy

for amala  ive never watched any other youtube vids by you before this one  i was off put at first by this one at first and was pleasantly surprised at the end  i respect your opinions and was happy to see other supporters of this channel as disagreeing about your barbie assessment yet doing so as respectful supporters for your content   im subscribing   and yes it is definitely the wokest movie of the year    there is no question about it 

to me this movie was about empathy  coexisting with respect and also about learning from mistakes and righting wrongs  self realization self actualization while also giving and receiving support from others  all served up with satire irony  humor and heartfelt care and yes  mini speeches   its complex  and it addresses complexities   my initial watch through  i was swapping the patriarchy and any archy out for one another real or perceived  if one substitutes in classic perception of 1950s patriarchy for what the barbies initially had the metaphor is almost seamless  when the kens overreact and flag wave with their major mojo domo absurdity etc its also almost a seamless metaphor for maga hopes and dreams  but then thats me applying a layer that may not be intended  but strip these added metaphors and its great on face value

i think the movie is almost the opposite  of what your initial conclusion was  i think it does keep with female empowerment  it is in no way threatening to males who arent already feeling threatened by inclusive trends in society it is clearly not mattel hating because it was made with mattel but it does address so many complaints about the barbie brand over the decades  while addressing future complaints headon  white savior barbie   note to producers casting margot robbie isnt the best for making this point etc  this movie is extremely selfaware of its affect on others  while margot and greta made an incredible movie so welcomed by so many for shining a light for mattel its a major rebranding for barbie and maybe ken to take them forward  they knew theyd be hit hard by the bud light reactionaries having a trans barbie was progressive and practically begging reactionaries to come at them   but from mattels perspective its about the most pro capitalist profiting move they could have possibly made    theres thingfetishism throughout the movie  apparently mattel execs felt pretty uneasy about many specific aspects of the film  but were talked through them so theyd understand and support   

 i think its fascinating  it says a lot about our culture that its such a lightning rod   loved or reviled by adults

743,@normacasini838,7/8/2023,3:25:07,6,"thank you for sharing your perspective on the 2023 barbie film its fascinating to see how the barbie brand has evolved over the years reflecting societal changes and continuing to inspire young girls and boys worldwide  my personal experience is a testament to how far women have come in terms of gender equality particularly in the stem fields the notion that certain professions or subjects are limited by gender is now widely recognized as outdated but its crucial to remember that this wasnt always the case the struggles faced by earlier generations like mine and of my mother she was born in 1917 who never was allowed to get her own credit card in her name until the mid70s  paved the way for the advancements women enjoy today

barbie since its inception has been a figure of empowerment in many ways from a fashion icon to a symbol of the modern working woman she has donned multiple hats sometimes literally to represent the possibilities that are open to women the fact that mattel has introduced barbies of different professions over the years from astronaut to doctor is a testament to this  thats when i figured as a tween that i would join the marines even though many around me said women arent allowed in the marines  i was active duty for 7 years and worked as a military journalist and broadcaster on the base

its also heartwarming to hear that you enjoyed the casting choices in the film the right actors can bring a lot of depth and authenticity to beloved characters making the story resonate even more with the audience weird barbie brings a smile to my face its great to have diverse personalities in movies showing kids that its okay to be different and that everyone has their unique qualities  i am also quite fine with transgender barbie why not

while films and toys might seem trivial to some they have always played a pivotal role in shaping young minds for goodness sake dolls and other toys are also used in childrens therapy sessions to help them express trayma etc   positive representation and diverse role models are crucial in creating a more inclusive and understanding society your video was thought provoking and very well done  thanks for the info and once again i loved the movie and undwrstood the double meanings very well because women like me liuved it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKPkSL-u7PUvjNLxl8X-oSQ,0.9978,positive,True

in my opinion this wasnt a movie promoting either a matriarchy or patriarchy as they both were shown to be oppressive to some degree towards the end the main message ended up being that whats best for everyone is somewhere in the middle barbie land will always be barbie land and run mainly by barbies  but now the kens have more respect and status kinda equal to how women are in the real world 

i can agree about the men in the real world being overly sexual and lacking basic decency but at the same time everything in the movie was taken to the extreme for entertainmentincluding the interactions between all the barbies

i also agree with your point about the daughter she was certainly insufferable and honestly useless as a character the movie wouldnt have changed at all if she were not in it she was mean to everyone for no reason especially her mom she wasnt funny she wasnt insightful she wasnt supportive she was literally just thereannoying everyone like a lingering fart",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLcpU468rrDOuCLdazPRoIA,0.968,positive,True

however while i understand it was satire in the real world the sheer amount of toxic masculinity shown was not realistic to me i agree with you amala that it really felt like a huge sign saying all men are sexual predators and actually useless other than being in power in the real world which is toxic in itself i also absolutely couldnt stand americas daughter she was absolutely insufferable and had no redemption for her horrible attitude that was largely responsible for her mothers depression in the first place it was basically a well i still think pretty much everything you care about is stupid but your my mom so ill make you happyinstead of them actually building a genuine connection the pair wouldve had a bigger impact as a single mom and teenage daughter as well because the only purpose the dad served was for them to make a joke about him being useless on the couch learning spanish and while i loved the speech she gave barbie because as a woman i really resonated with it its was almost completely undermined for me  by the deprogramming speechs to the other barbies i also felt it sleazy that their solution to taking back their power was to use their romance and sexuality to purposely turn the kens against each other to get their way which honestly isnt a very feminist message quite frankly barbies revelation to ken was almost immediately completely undermined as well when the narrator line made clear they had no intention of having gender equality whatsoever even though the kens would be granted more perks

what i wanted to say tough its that it could have been a really great movie if you twisted the end a little bit kens want to take over control because they didnt exist until that point i mean the little girl even asks where their homes are and nobody knows so theyre basically homeless 

and we clearly see that kens love barbies when ken kicks out the barbie of his mojo dojo casa house we see he doesnt want to do it but feels he has to in reality he wants her to stay he yells yes when she finally comes by etc

what could have been brillant is that when barbies take back the control of barbie land they decide to give more rights to kens share houses rights everything and make a truly equal society which is neither a patriarchy nor a patriarchy gives them jobs in the government and so on 
another options is that kens could have stop their final fight just in time to go back to the congress and then the votes could have been really democratic and come to a fair ending

love your outfit and your vibe in this video you look amazing

and i also would like to say that i dont agree with you and id like to ask you to watch the movie one more time with this in mind

spoilers ahead

i think that the director choose barbie  ken as metaphors for the feminine principle and the masculine in each of us

similar to adam  eve in the bible the yin  yang principle in buddhism edward norton  tyler durden in fight club dan millman  socrates in peaceful warrior or adam  eve in the series dark and many many more

for example the scene where barbie and ruth touch hands is a direct nod to michelangelos painting creation of adam in which god comes riding in what can only be explained as a brainshaped cloud the mind extends his hand fully to reach out to adam the body whos finger is only partially extended because adam needs to put in the effort to extend his hand fully if he wants to connect to a higher power 

in a way the barbie movie is the story of her extending her finger do you see it

please notice that the patriarchy is a result of an imbalanced way of being in which all power is given solely to the masculine principle which suppresses the feminine  no bueno

reversely when the feminine rules  matriarchy all is seemingly perfect in barbie land but then becomes superficial and meaningless in the face of death as it lacks depth and causes the masculine to feel useless  which only brews trouble no bueno either

so what do they do they need to come together
but first they must be deprogrammed aka see and share the truth

this is why the barbies get deprogrammed as they listen to the truth of how theyve been programmed with unbalanced ideas in the first place 
and so do the kens at the end of the movie they all become their true selves

another way of seeing what the movie is really about is the duality of the conscious and unconscious once united happiness is no longer found in external things such as relationships but happiness comes from within 
this is why barbie doesnt hook up with ken because she no longer has to accept the story imposed on her by others she can pave her on way forward she is free

thats why the ending is about barbie going to gynecologist in normal clothes because now she has become whole a real woman 

i hope you truly get the meaning behind it because it truly is beautiful and i think everybody should see it and im a grown ass man

1 the portrayal of women lacking respect for one another and in real life women like barbies are engaging in moral wrong behaviors like stealing someone elses partner by using attractiveness and naivety and competing with each other regardless of the consequences 

2 barbie often emphasizes her appearance showing a lot of skin and strives not to be seen as an object yet it would be better to promote modesty appropriate behavior towards men and avoiding excessive flirting

3 the movie seems to promote the idea of women treating men as toys to be controlled wanting their undivided attention while not reciprocating the same feelings this portrays an unstable and unhealthy representation of women

4 barbie and similar portrayals may inadvertently shape wrong attitudes in men promoting the objectification of women and a lack of moral values

in summary these aspects of the barbie movie contribute to my overall negative perception of it

and if barbie would have been a real life person she would have been pregnant which is nothing wrong about that as long she chosen the right person and is willing to commit a serious relationship in many levels but yet she would leave the man for someone else because she doesnt feel itthe child would be collateral damage and he or she the child would not know what a stable and good family would look and behave like she would then find her joy in life multiple times and she would not care for her child in the appropriate way because her ego is too big and important her ex would be annoyed by herm so he would behave stupidly she is constantly trying to find satisfaction in material things and  in her carrier or from the love aspect but this poor little women isnt finding it so the world is to blame and especially the men if she would have raised a boy this boy wouldnt be raised a good men so the vicious cycle is continuing

also one of the lines in the movie was something like humans invent things like barbie and the patriarchy to cope with the uncertainty of life as a whole to me this means that the overall message is that the idea of the patriarchy still being prevalent isnt actually true anymore but some people prefer to believe that to feel better about their life situations

i think that individualism autonomy and freedom to think for yourself is also touched on this one as seen at the end with barbie empowering ken about finding himself as he is and not just as her boyfriend and also with ruth handler having a heart to heart with barbie being endless in her possibilities as an individual that creates meaning

yes most of the film is a representation of modern day feminists perspective and woke movement but i think greta also challenged the notion with the idea of individual liberty and equity in terms of human rights as seen by the end of the film

i also feel bad for ken in the film as it seems that empowering people cant be done without degrading someone but am happy at the end as shown that neither party exist for the sole purpose of rubbing ones feet but an individual with a birthright to be themselves",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY8oLQ6zg4BODSwA7pL8XmQ,0.9315,positive,True

979,@GlennThoughts,3/8/2023,4:00:23,1,"now that ive analyzed the movie a bit i think its not feminist i think its actually the opposite because after watching this movie

 you will love ken which is a man
 you will realize the everyone is happier in patriarchy even the barbies when ken turned the barbieland to patriarchy
 matriarchy is kinda miserable and chaotic hence ken managed to overthrow it and barbie werent really happy at all back then and even barbie herself went back to real world which is obviously a patriarchy because she knows that its better than their fake world
 you will hate america and her speech
 you will hate americas daughter most specially
 you will realize the america loves herself more than she loves her daughter which is the exact opposite of real world because mothers are the greatest gift of us all they love their children more than they love themselves hekc they will even die in labor just to give life to their children
 you will realize how pathetic women or basically feminists thinks breaking baby dolls mocking pregnancy which is life giving promoting selfishness and narcisism and even prioritizing having a vagina which mocks trans women and definitely not fighting for equality
 you will realize than kens are happier just the way they are simple and not judgemental like real men happy on their toys computer games same shirt every day etc
 you will realize that barbie is a bad toy its a bad influence the movie is even hating on mattel whos its creator
 you will realize that this movie shows that woman are the greatest enemy of women not men women are the one that mocks beauty dresses sizes anti love and relationship and pro selfishness and singlehood anti life creation and basically anti god because they oppose everything bible says like love thy neighbor love and submit to your husband pro create everything its like this movie shows how evil women can be while men just generally loves women that simple

so i think this movie is actually not feminists its anti feminist in disguise it just showed the world how actually evil and selfish woman can be kinda reminding us all that eve bit the forbidden fruit following the order of the devil serpent and luring adam to eat the forbidden fruit too reminds us that cheateing men are because of a woman seducing the married men exactly what eve did to adam very seldom you see a man seducing a married women because men respects each other while woman totally hates one another they will even be proud to say he loves me more than he loves his wife women hate being in the same dress they hate prettier and sexier woman than themselves they are always jealous because they mostly insecure and only care for themselves and want to be the center of attention they spread fake news against one another they sell their body and sexuality they seduce everyone in tiktok reels ig everything women tends to have an over power love for themselves and themselves only totally not caring at all to others rrgardless if they destroy families or relationships and this movie showed that thats why after the movie you will love ken and kinda hate barbies actually what an intelligent movie salute",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKTPjd-fCrSllFQdqcNkUQ,0.6235,positive,True

1 in barbies first experience in the real world the real world was just as much of a fantasy of barbie land appeared to us you could even make a cinematic argument that barbie land is real and the real world is their fantasy image about what our real world is like which explains why it is so weird and the men are so ineffectual  thats all the barbies know
2 ken finds out about the patriarchy from a highly superficial level its all off camera but when he finds out its not about horses he loses interest which tells you just how much he actually learned about patriarchy
3 the conflict is all done using wordsconceptsmemesideas and there are plenty of realworld examples of unredeeming and unworthy ideas that took popular root
4 right after the barbies regain power they go right back to their old ways and any reform for the kens is highly superficial

if you take the women vs men out of the discussion cast this thought instead about haves vs have nots or nobility vs serfs or elites vs nobodies the people in power think that everything is perfect without realizing or caring what the people without power do any rebellion will replace the ruling class but the former have nots will be just as cruel as their former masters who are just trying to restore the previous status quo",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1nOShaSVScOzKn7Uc0BgbQ,-0.91,negative,True

i believe this movie is not for children it is rated pg13 however parents continue to bring their children as they believe it is a childrens movie which is understandable if i didnt read the rating ahead of time i would assume this was a rated g movie

i believe this movie is supposed to be a satire due to who the producer is and the other movies she has produced barbie is supposed to represent the flip side of the world we used to live in women have the power and men are the trophy husbands however when it swung to the patriarchy women hated it much how like men hated feminism even the ending where the kens were denied instant government power is so similar to the world we live in when women tried to receive power the first time i believe part of this movie was to be comedic and to make fun of the patriarchy as well as the matriarchy

however i also believe there was a feminist liberal woke agenda as well they did represent the men in our world as dumb and that anything masculine is seen as misogynistic they also made majority of the men in the movie have raw emotions and act in a more gay like manner the few men that were represented to be masculine were seen as pigs for harassing barbie

i enjoyed the movie for the most part but i did recognize parts as well that were controversial like with all movies there is always room for improvement and will not please everyone",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFVug86NQEurSjJ6if0R6jQ,0.7308,positive,True

then the whole movie is cringeworthy boring slow and so feminist that it hurt my brain i think i can say that its the worst movie i have seen so far all the men in the movie the kens and the real world men are either completely stupid or disgusting perverts the women on the other hand are strong intelligent capable and can very easily take over all the traditionally masculine jobs it is very clear that they dont need men at all

the plot was so boring and just plain awful in the end the barbies trick the kens by distracting them so that they cant vote  go figure there is a scene in which the kens are lovingly playing their guitars and singing to the barbies who then ditch them on purpose it is just sooooo ugly and a real eyesore

i hope they get the backlash they deserve i really hope people see through it the whole agendafeminismdiversitymenhating theme is more blatant than i have ever seen they tell you to your face that men deserve nothing and that women dont need them

1057,@njambagachoki9010,2/8/2023,7:42:47,1,"i thought the messaging in this film was brilliant   

    the film rags on about how bad the patriarchy is and takes on a purely antithetical stance in the sense that it creates a matriarchy in barbieland where all the kens are 2nd class citizens with no real jobs rights or even purpose the kens simply exist and are treated as nonentities     or occasional cheerleaders by the barbies
    is it any wonder that the kens like anyone whos been treated like crap and largely ignored would go giddy and full on bonkers when introduced to the patriarchy for the first time in the entirety of their existence they felt like they actually mattered and had worth 
    but true to the barbarous nature of this film and its makers rather than use the frustration fueled retaliatory extremism of the kens to address the systemic inequalities in barbieland and bring both the barbies and kens to a better understanding of each other and the creation of a more equitable system as any competent nonagenda driven film would the barbies instead trick the kens into fighting each other and once more create the very matriarchal system that caused all their problems to begin with
    the kens are once more relegated to 2nd class citizens with no real jobs or rights relative to the barbies the only difference is that this time the kens have been told that they should sod off and find themselves and no longer seek validation from the barbies even though the barbies still hold all the power rights jobs and property the very things that give people a sense of value in any society
    whats frustrating is that the barbies had a chance to take the higher road and be the bigger dolls by simply amending their constitution and giving the kens the very equality that would have created a more fair society that values everyone regardless of gender instead as aforestated the barbies recreated the matriarchal hegemony that favored the barbies and ignored the kens 
    if this doesnt prove that the makers of this film are feminazis   rather than feminists i dont know what more evidence is needed any messaging about equality in this film is completely nonexistent despite what anyone says this film is less a film and more a spiteful and bitter rant on how incompetent and insecure men are   except alan who supports the barbies despite also being ignored and forgotten by literally everyone else including the barbies and advocates for a society whose balance is tilted in favor of women especially as some form of revenge for past discrimination in the real world

barbieland  feels like the manifestation of beyonces song run the world girls

theres a guy called jim palmer yes a man and somehow he gets it how can you as a woman not get it that is sad

this is what he wrote

it seems that everything that could possibly be said about the barbie movie has been said i recently saw it and decided to share five things i learned from it 

1 its not all about me

there were some men who were not happy because they felt that the barbie movie cast a bad light upon them i personally did not feel this way but everyone has a right to feel what they feel but heres the thing in my view the movie was about barbie and by extension the struggles and hardships around what it really means to be a woman outside the confusing contradictory and unrealistic expectations of society particularly male culture to investigate this idea further one could read the second sex by simone de beauvoir but i learned its not all about me as a man its okay for there to be a barbie movie its okay for women to give voice to their journey and struggle to fully be themselves though i didnt feel the film was manhating its wasnt the job of the barbie movie to coddle men and not offend them if men are this upset by it go make a ken movie to tell the story of the difficulties of being a man

2 its all about me

i couldnt watch the barbie movie as a casual observer it forced me to own the ways i have been complicit in perpetuating harmful patriarchy doing so consciously or unconsciously the harmful consequences are the same my religious conditioning programmed me with an untrue flawed inadequate and harmful view of women i have documented this before for example here are at least several ways religion that corrupted my view of women

women brought sin and death into the world 

women are to blame for the fall of the human race

women are inferior to men physically mentally and spiritually

women were intended to be subservient to men

women are not capable of exercising authority and leadership

a godly woman is a silent submissive and domestic woman

women are responsible for the sexual temptations and transgressions of men

women are weak emotional and irrational

women are expected by god to stay in demeaning damaging 
destructive or abusive relationships

women should deny and repress themselves in order to serve and satisfy others

women who act assertively and defiantly enforce personal boundaries or express anger are ungodly

the barbie movie pressed upon my heart a deep sorrow for any belief mindset attitude or action that perpetuated a damaging view of women or placed unfair limitations and expectations about them the world men and women have suffered greatly as a result of preventing women from actualizing their fullest potentialities and possibilities 

i discovered in the movie that i was completely ignorant about barbie the doll the barbie doll represented all the possibilities of what it could mean to be a woman as early as 1965 there was an astronaut and space scientist barbie barbie has been a teacher veterinarian member of the armed forces business executive doctor police officer computer engineer architect paleontologist judge etc the barbie doll line has evolved over the years to be culturally diverse body image diverse has included women with disabilities and been inclusive all around

it was men who sexualized and objectified barbie yes the original barbie was petite shapely and had long legs this was partly so the doll could be played with easily  for example the long legs so that barbie could be walked around in play the barbie creator ruth handler was not intending for barbie to be sexualized look people men barbie was a fickin doll women have breasts and may be shapely in other ways so get over it theres nothing wrong with that that doesnt mean a shapely woman or doll was created to be a sex object religion has historically required women to cover up their body up so as not to tempt mean maybe men instead should address the root issues that cause them to objectify women

3 and then there was allan

there has been a lot of discussion about who allan was meant to represent in the barbie movie the allan doll was named after the soninlaw of mattel cofounder ruth handler the first allan doll was released in 1964 he was marketed as kens friend in the barbie movie who allan represented to me is someone who doesnt fit in someone who is always on the outside looking in someone who no one takes the time to really get to know someone who doesnt feel they belong someone for whom the labels and categories dont make sense someone who is hardly noticed someone who wants to be accepted celebrated desired and loved for who they are someone who is likely to befriend the marginalized victimized and oppressed because they can relate the allan character in the barbie movie deeply touched my heart and i could relate to this character in many ways its that feeling that you werent really made for this world and there is no place where you truly seem to fit i always have my radar up for allans i consider it to be one of the greatest gifts in life to express to a allan how special worthy and loved they are

4 its not easy being ken 

in my view the barbie film also depicted how difficult it is to be a ken some of the key questions for men i got from the movie are

what does being a man mean once the traditional patriarchal scripts are torn apart

what would it mean as men to heal our broken mindsets attitudes beliefs and relationship with women

what would it mean to not be threatened by women or competing against women but to see women as our allies and cultivate mutually empowering relationships

where or what is my true source of our worth and identity as men

what would it mean to grieve and heal from the confusion hurt dysfunction and loss of how we as men once did manhood and masculinity

5 take my hands close your eyes now feel

i dont think i can ever forget the ending of the barbie movie there barbie was wanting to give up all the scripts and the pressures to be perfect all the denials pretense inauthenticities filters and fake smiles of her madeup barbie world she asked ruth what she needed to do to say goodbye to barbie world and be human in the real world she was told to close her eyes and feel to feel it all to feel what it really meant to be human

the deal with being human is that there is 10000 joys and 10000 sorrows you dont know what will kill you first the beauty of the world or the sorrow of it the sorrows dont prevent the joys and the joys dont spare you of the sorrows look its not easy for anyone to leave barbie world and be real but after seeing and feeling all of it barbie said yes what is that yes its the yes of truly being present for it all being all there 

maybe what i learned most from the barbie movie is the need to say yes to being human and lived human experience all of it maybe that means learning how to say yes to the joys and sorrows of your own life and saying yes to the process of healing and becoming more whole inside maybe its also men and women saying yes to each other  yes i am sorry if i hurt you yes i want to start over and learn what it means to truly accept love and be there for each other

i love my daughter more than anything else in this world i am so proud of the woman she has become and is becoming each day there are so many good beautiful extraordinary and brilliant  parts of her the deepest wish in my heart is for her genuine happiness the barbie movie invited me to carry that wish in my heart for every woman

fashion exists so that housewives would have something to talk about while the patriarchy was keeping everything running this movie would have more merit in my opinion if the men would be portrayed as pampered homemakers and women were utilitarian and only concerned with putting food on the table and keeping the world running

1168,@ethan-ub1cv,1/8/2023,9:21:42,0,"i think the point of the movie is that both the patriarchy and matriarchy are bad 

i do see how they went a little bit too far with the sexual violence but it serves the purpose of hyperbole which is what the movie is it needs to be taken to extremes to be understood

in the real world as well the people that hear ken say he wants the patriarchy back are confused i think he takes it too far after reading old fashioned books about the power of men he comes from a land where men are nothing more than women extensions hes excited to see hes worth smth

which takes me to my next point the movie shows that any extreme of power is hurtful to both sexes the person in power has too much on their plate while the other person is constantly seeking approval for the sex on top

in the end barbie encourages ken to seek himself outside of barbie the point couldve been more clear but what its saying is that the matriarchy is detrimental to everyone as well ken is hurt by the dynamic and the pressure on barbie hurts her as well

ken also admits that he didnt like the patriarchy hes just trying to be seen hes doing all of those things that are seen as sexist mansplaining or the guitar thing in order to be liked to be approved he cant even cry in public the patriarchy not only hurts women but also men

i think that a lot of people are going into this movie with bias in order to find something woke or conservative about it the film although it couldve been better represented tries to reach a compromise between the way we were and the way were going its an attack towards sexist claims but also towards antiman feminism two things can be true at once

a hk columnist writer that i particularly liked past tense was saying that although i have yet to see the film but america ferreras monologue really really touched my heart and spoke my mind

my bs detector instantly lit up and was telling her how this movies problematic version of feminism is completely wrong how the monologue if given the context would be shifting all the blame on men and complete disregard the fact that women should also bear responsibilities over how the society treats women i literally told her that she should pay my personal facebook page a visit which i wrote a full review in chinese to hopefully provide her a fairer view before she make such comment

she continues to say that the monologue is well written and all she said is how much men suck in asia because they would create problems and make women suffer for their mistakes just like how america ferrara said men would knock up women and refuse to take responsibility let their wives and their mother argue with each other without solving problems and men would cheat on their wives etc

why would so many women still be siding with such nonsense i mean as a man i totally support feminism sexual equality and women empowerment this movie is basically telling children that men are idiots that shouldnt be respected or even given proper respect ken are still homeless hobos at the end of the movie and they are still being treated like shit and unloved this is not how all men in the real world is right there are still faithful loving men and husband who would treat their women with love respect and most of all faith

of course the comment section irrevocably ended with the supposedly columnist cursing angrily because i said that she cant just like and promote a quote from the movie without recognizing the underlying context that it conveys then again the way she presented herself sort of makes her a distorted feminism supporter to begin with and a bitter mother of two she would then go on to say that i am a patriarchy supporter who oppresses women because i am stopping her from posting things on her own public page that markets herself as an intelligent and fair writercommentator of social issues

the awakening of feminism doesnt have to be the downfall of men it can be a winwin if women across the globe can recognize that not only men were responsible for what the world is now but women were as well this can be a winwin situation for both sexes rather than how this barbie movie is portraying

honestly if this is how women wish men to be treated just like how the kens were treated in the movie i fail to see a bright future for feminism ahead",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOrDmEtEfcUhT4H38vChQlQ,0.958,positive,True

kens dont have barbie houses they are the accessory to barbie thats fine thats the girls space in imagination land kens taking over is like boys in the real world tryna snatch your barbies away from you think about it 
yeah the guys are dumb yeah the real men are like that but this movie is duality its definitely the coming of age movie you missed out the connection between the barbie  the mother and her daughter so yeah there was feminist speeches but us guys are not playing with barbies lol  why have barbies doing domestic things women are supposed to do its make believe 
i see the feminist under tones and its not even an undertone cuz its right in your face i think this movie is for the women who grew up with barbies im a dude and i was dying of laughter in the movie the part at the beach where the girls switch guys man i lost it its the grimy shot women do in real life i laughed hard i didnt like it but then i got reminded its barbie and dudes dont play with barbies i went with my sisters that i grew up with to watch this hella relatable it was a good movie some shit said i dont like but man when you see whos playing the ken dolls in this movie shit is so freaking funny and fun so yeah thats my thoughts l",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBFVtCisyG7Uq9CODNHnxw,0.9719,positive,True

here we go 
the barbie movie was beautiful nostalgic and the actors were killing it as for any of the actors being vapid for women or acting too feminine for men i see why youd think so i personally think its a stylistic choice based on the childrens toys realityidea children tend to be childish and overly reactive to minor things and idea they reject so i found it to be a valid choice as for the men being to feminine i dont think thats possible i think its a harmful idea that someone has to fit a stereotype so i dont agree with that at all
as for patriarchy being bad i think we can all agree that anything being taken to the extreme is bad which is why both the matriarchy and the patriarchy are so bad in the barbie world theyre taken to the extreme to be fair i believe the barbie movie attempts to throw light on that but misses the mark a bit overall not a great but not the worst movie 
and yes i would share it with kids because lets be real theyd probably enjoy it way more than adults would also why was it a problem that barbieland had a transgender barbie is the problem just that she was transgender or that she was cast as a female are we of some belief that she was  what taking a role from a actual female actress is that it  cause im pretty sure they wanted those extra diversity points

showing both exaggerated matriarchy and exaggerated patriarchy as untenable is true  neither has ever existed in our complex reality if people still think after watching the movie that patriarchy is worse than matriarchy then thats on them and societal norms not the movie the ending message teaching its better to be a human in the real world than an idea in a fake selfish utopia is great and what a lot of people today need to hear

where it all falls apart is that bloody monologue about how hard it is to be a woman because while most of these impossible contradictory social expectations do exist in reality very few of us will experience or be affected by all of them and more importantly they are all just as true of men as of women men are also expected to be fit which means thin but never say it men are also expected to be parents without talking about it in public and to have careers but still be available for their family men who dont are despised by society men are also expected to lead without being mean  mean male leaders are always depicted as villains men are quite frankly more likely to be taken to task for being rude than women women wont accept rudeness from boyfriends but men will from girlfriends and as a woman i could be ruder to a boss without getting fired than a man can not that i should be rude of course

so the point is it should have been equal at the end human life is hard and society has crazy madeup expectations for everybody regardless of sex america should have been saying this to both ken and barbie teaching them  and the audience  that the real world is not perfect but its better than living in denial and at some point we have to leave childish games behind and take on reallife challenges which would have hit right on the point of the past barbie nostalgia that got everything into the movie theatre in the first place

the barbieland part of the movie including the way barbies and kens act is portrayed that way because thats how kids play barbie barbies seems stupid to viewers but they are actually just childish they are childish because they are literally being played by little girls in the real world kens are taken for granted and unimportant because thats how ken dolls are used in little girls plays ken is one of barbies accessories just like the car the house the clothes etc 
when barbie steps into the real world she is surprised because the world is not like barbieland she is sexualized and not taken seriously by the real life man for the first time something a ken would never because little girls would never for little girls barbie is everything and ken is taken seriously and validated for the first time
i also didnt see the mattel executives as bad guys they are just man who are not extremely qualified for their jobs but they got the job anyway because they are man most positions of leadership in the real world are filled by man does that mean man are more qualified to lead than women of course not this happens because man still benefits each other in the real world so the mattel executives are an exageration of how in the real world sometimes man would get a job over a more qualified woman simply because they are man and who more qualified to lead a company that makes toys for little girls than ah crazy thought here a girl
i dont think the movie is suggesting we still live in a classic patriarchy where the evil man rule the world there is a scene where ken asks a guy if man dont get better chances than women after all he is questioning if he got it wrong cause he didnt get the jobs he wanted just for being a man and the real life man responds we still kind of do but now we have to hide it we dont live in a world where the evil man rule but man are still in a position of power over women this is something real for us and exagerated in the movie 
for the rest of the movie the word patriarchy is used to refer what ken thinks is the patriarchy which includes horses because being played by a little kid he sees a man in power on top of a horse and think this is it
so there you go the movie actually exaggerates some aspects of the real world and uses the way little girls play with barbie to raise a conversation on how girls idealize their adult lives and how different it is to the way they are treated in real life it tries to show how a girl has to be extraordinary to get the same praise as a ordinary man how girls are sexualized and feel a hint of violence in the mans gaze how we never meet the impossible standards that are imposed on us standards of beautiful delicate but also independent but also a good mother but also dont have the life centered in her kids because thats outdated but also stand out at work but cant be payed more money than her partner because he might feel bad etc ",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFqlhHjun96q39IharJSCzA,-0.913,negative,True

for a feministfilm the women human not barbie were very two dimensional the mother was shallow and childish and her daughter was a resentful teen however the daughters resentment towards her mom was played off as something so terrible and out of the ordinary that the mother feels like shes a failure because her daughter doesnt like her the mom victimises herself by putting herself in positions where she can easily be rejected by her daughter and then feels terrible when the inevitable happens
anyway they randomly become besties later on after the mom gives an inspiringspeech about how its difficult to be a woman because you have to be this and that anyway this speech manages to break the spell of patriarchy that ken has introduced from the real world 

and speaking of ken who is regarded as a fool by everyone in barbieland he manages to somehow successfully import these immature reductive notions of patriarchy to this feminist utopia and wreak havoc in less than a day he completely reorders the structure of barbieland into a chad supremacy where the barbies serve the kens beer and whatever 

if anything ken makes the feminist utopia of barbieland seem weak superficial and unprepared in how easily it collapses like a house of cards at the hands of halfwit 

so somehow ken is the most op character in the whole movie

the aspect of patriarchy that ken brings back to barbieland i thought was a play on the extremes of patriachy itself you know the satire is there because the mount rushmore of barbieland became all horses in kens worldview his fascination with the idea of patriarchy and his extreme take made sense considering where hes from but it really just seemed like a get back tactic in the long run not so much something he really believed in

my biggest gripe might be the part where they were breaking the barbies out of their trance but only cause it felt kinda cringe with the delivery not even so much what they were saying because again if you consider the world setting here i think alot of the commentary makes sense barbieland only really made sense in a matriarchy when you consider the way the product has been run historically

also the end where she says she didnt feel like barbie anymore kinda showed imo she didnt agree with their world view either and she willingly chose to live in the real world despite the perception that its run by men according to ken i thought that spoke more to her believing its was the opposite and more fair in its approach of both men and women versus barbieland",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_GbwiZF7HvdDjOCqFwcyKA,0.9414,positive,True

men are better off being submissive and dependent on women or they just make everything a frat party the barbies live in a feminist socialist utopia with men as thier pets thats the message were pushing on young boys and girls also you can defeat the patriarchy by being narcistic and manipulative to make them fight each other

i have to agree on a lot of points one of them being that insufferable daughter the patriarchy talk was just as annoying but the scene where ken was trying to get a job kind of backfired their message a bit the guy who said we do patriarchy well but hide it bettermade no sense he contradicted himself perfectly and almost debunked the message imo 
what did make it enjoyable was ken yes he was portrayed a little more feminine and sort of stupid but he was the most relatable character there yes i know the  he is literally me memes
the mom was sort of cool and her first speech was honestly partially relatable aswell 
as a woman it is hard sometimes to deal with all the expectations put on us its the same for men no doubt especially in this new woke world thats the difficulties they failed to mention

1930,@TheGreatWerebear,27/7/2023,18:41:17,4,"im late to the party but ill throw my two cents out there
as a woman living in the us ive experienced my fair share of mistreatment at the hands of misogynistic men  i dont think it serves to talk like it doesnt happen  ive been catcalled and groped and harrassed in public by strangers  ive been mistreated in the workplace and then had the old boys club mentality rear its ugly head when i tried to get help dealing with it from higher ups  ive been excluded from important opportunities based on my gender that still happens particularly in areas where its not technically illegal   also workplace and catcalling aside there have certainly been people in my personal life whove felt comfortable dismissing me excluding me talking down to me abusing me viewing my opinion as less weighty or important or even blatantly ignoring me because i happened to be female that stuff is real and its not disingenuous to portray it  it isnt victim mentality to acknowledge that in some places with some people being female is a distinct disadvantage that youll have to work harder and be better in order to make progress or be respected and some progress and respect will simply be denied you no matter what you do because youre a woman  its rarer than it used to be but again it still happens 

all that having been said it really gets under my skin when peoples reaction to this is to pretend that men are somehow all the same all the problem all incompetent and hold all the cards  first off of the men who mistreated me some of them actually have qualities i super respect and its just untrue to act like they were big doofy meanspirited buffoons  they had blind spots and biases and insecurities and misplaced loyalties  so do we all  that aside ive known so many guys who are so genuine so kind so empowering so intelligent so excellent at so many different things  it drives me bonkers when people make blanket statements about men when there is so much variety among men  its inaccurate  its unjust  and it hurts people who dont deserve it  

in general im not a fan of the fingerpointing mentality people who talk about patriarchy often have  im also not a fan of the victim mentality that so often also gets involved  its important to acknowledge real struggles but only in the spirit of compassion and empowerment  this movie as youve described it sounds a little more like spitefulvindictive wish fulfilment which is not my jam

edit actually amala i want to add a note to you directly on this with appreciation because i really respect your channel and i think youre doing a good thing here  in general when talking about issues of discriminationwhether thats based on race gender whateversometimes you can come across as a little dismissive of the experiences people do still have today in the us  its not that you never acknowledge them but perhaps do acknowledge them a little more seriously  its important for people who had experienced discrimination to learn how to be strong kind and fair rather than reactionary and it can be easier to do that when the struggles theyve experienced are validated  if people have a place where they no longer have to fight to feel heard if they can feel safe to put their weapons down theyll be a lot more interested in hearing how to work toward peace",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFAN4D5I6cZvRenoNupgAVw,0.9977,positive,True

apparently people often forgot this as theyre apparently difficult concepts to grasp and remember 
1 opinions and viewpoints you are absolutely allowed to have an opinion and to state your viewpoint people here will fight for your right to have that opinion and to share your thoughts openly and uncensored even if that opinion is trash and youre completely incorrect and afterward those same people will exercise their right to share their thoughts and opinions by telling you that youre an idiot lol welcome to america 

2 so bad its good so bad its goodis a real and true adjective it means that something can be so god awful and dire that it actually become amusing and entertaining to seehear about it blatantly fail dont get it wrong its still objectively bad but there are a large group of people who enjoy dumpster fires and get a kick out of it that doesnt make it good or successful 

3 advertising plugs and political messages if you didnt know companies andor politicians place advertising plugs and political messages into entertainment as a way for those companies andor politicians to curry favor with their customersconstituents and to entice those customersconstituents to buy their productsthink like they do sometimes these advertisementsmessages are covert or subliminal that often go unnoticed however nowadays theyre often completely overt advertisingmessaging that are crass and inyourface all in all its a highly profitable business one that has existed and been inplace in the usa for at least the last 100 years the best ones are the ones that influence and manipulate you without you being aware of it

2023s barbie movie directed by greta gerwig and starring margot robbie and ryan gosling relates to all of the points above mattels barbiefashion doll brand is a massive generational ip intellectual property everyone in the world has heard of barbie and probably at one point or another has owned a barbie or ken doll like the walt disney company nintendo company etc anything these companies produce or come out with will be considered an automatic guaranteed success even if it is a objectively and genuinely flawedbad product that doesnt sell and ends up loosing the company money thats simply one of the benefit of being such a large and wellknown company regarding the movie sure its an amusing movie with lost of scenes that would make any adhd person happy and margot robbie does an amazing job portraying a barbielikecharacter however the movie forcefully creates drama and conflict when there wasnt a need in the first place ergo the matriarchalpatriarchal divide of the barbies and the kens that while one group is in the lightand enjoys life the other group must be in the darkand suffer culminating in an allout female vs male war for dominancy speaking of suffering this movie suffers greatly from being rife with blatant modern neofeministic political messaging all the barbiesare propped up coddled empowered strong intelligent capable kind and any other positive attribute you can think of while all the kensare knocked down weak dumb incapable rude and any other negative attribute you can think of all of barbies woes in this movie stem from both 1 gloria america ferrera and 2 ken ryan gosling the movie portrays that barbie is being held back and sabotaged by ken who would otherwise be perfectly flawless in every single way and would ascend to goddesshood if it werent for ken having feelings and aspiring to be something more so in this way 2023s barbie attempts to portray ken and the kensas the villains when in reality theyre just average men 2023s barbie also doesnt stick to barbies generational personality characteristics and beliefs that she is well known for in this way disneys 2000 lifesizedirected by mark rosman and starring lindsay lohan and tyra banks was a far superior and more accurate portrayal of the barbie brand barbies personality and beliefs and barbies life its actually such a difference that people are now beginning to question if greta gerwig intentionally directed 2023s barbie movie to be a satirical take at barbie and specifically poke fun at modern women dont believe me the word patriarchywas explicitly used a total of twelve 12 times in the movie

2025,@brideofallunquietthings7992,27/7/2023,11:46:55,2,"i actually really liked it but i had a really different take on it i dont think they ever suggested suppressing men and i thought the comment about men having as much power in barbie land as women have in the world was great and actually left it open ended its not very compassionate but that is fair it does suggest the only thing that would make everyone happy is a balance of power because somebody is losing in either world unless it is equal her advice to ken at the end is also to know himself and find his self worth as an individual which i dont see as oppressive at all and as much as i hate the word woke thats really great advice because not only is it exactly what the character needs but people do sustain oppressive systems as a way of avoiding themselves

and what youre calling as a portrayal of men as dumb i thought was speaking to emotional immaturity woundedness and egoic reactivity that underlies the patriarchy is it compassionate not particularly accept when she sits with him at the end but i think it is suggested that men can handle that and support each other through it with the very brotherhood they already have  

no the movie doesnt talk about the healthy men the men who dont want to participate in patriarchy accept for allan i almost wish he wasnt comedic because he displays honesty integrity kindness and courage and isnt taken seriously or seen as value when those are the traits i admire in men most the film also doesnt really mention the women who have managed to sustain a sense of freedom and autonomy inspite if it i dont think its an accurate representation of society more addressing the part of it that it wants to the patriarchy i could see why you wouldnt want a young person to leave the theater thinking thats just the way the world is but i simply love that its acknowledging what its like for some of us who still feel trapped by it americas speech i related i think its meant to acknowledge not as much suggest any solution i would read it as satire its extreme but to be honest it actually doesnt even feel yes i said feel that extreme to me 

i also think the film is essentially for women and it doesnt give any advice for how to work together but i honestly dont see how the genders can authentically work together without a power balance the film doesnt even suggest it which i think is simply the point of the film i see ways ive given my power away portrayed in the film and justified it as ok for ages

also i am an american but watched this film in turkey this is a worldwide issue do you know what is happing in iran right now i have friends fleeing their homeland because they dont want to be arrested or killed for refusing to wear a hijab detaching from the system altogether is the only choice some people have and expecting people to have a perfectly woke solution to centuries of deeply entrained ideologies and institutions today is something im coming to no longer expect if it blows the whistle at this point im for it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA5f64VvuvUaeRG1sJNXneA,0.9964,positive,True

and let me tell you this movie didnt just stop at pushing the feminist agenda it practically dripped with menhating undertones seriously could they have been any more obvious about their disdain for the male characters its like they completely forgot that feminism is about equality not bashing an entire gender

but wait theres more brace yourselves for the mindboggling lack of a story i kid you not its as if they tossed all the plot points into a blender and pressed the random button im still trying to piece together what the heck was happening throughout the whole thing it was like a rollercoaster of disjointed scenes that left me feeling utterly bewildered

and dont even get me started on their attempt at thirdgen feminist propaganda ive seen better attempts at indoctrination from an infomercial look im all for supporting social change but this film couldnt have gone about it in a more hamfisted way if it tried give us some credit we can handle more nuanced storytelling than this

the movie focuses too much on barbies regaining their rule over barbieland and in the end the men and women still arent equal this way the political message seems like a desperate attempt to prove how bad patriarchy is by simply switching the genders and going extra with it without ever actually resolving any problems enough and only focusing on how women should have more power it isnt overly thought through and its unaware of its own radicality and idealistic dogma and therefore its definitely not appropriate for children",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMBmUTpI4tdlaWTYw6PHyTA,-0.1295,negative,True

the film has two screenwriters which perhaps explains its mixed messaging there are some comments criticizing a simplified view of the patriarchy pointing out you cant get a ceo job without an mba irregardless of gender for example but ultimately it asks us to buy into a simplified view of the patriarchy strangely punctuated by an extradiegetic image gallery of sylvester stallone for some reason

it also briefly criticizes a divide of the sexes with sympathy towards the solely subservient ken in parts but ultimately ends on a triumphant division of the sexes with women writing the constitution

in keeping with modern culture all men in the movie are hopeless buffoons and all women are innately wonderful they seem to be mocking this idea at the start with women winning noble prizes seemingly without doing any work but end up reconfirming this culturally cliched trope

the men become the clear villains with a desperate need to impress themselves upon women and to compete with each other to do so any attempts to please women through such sinister means as singing paying compliments and wishing to protect are portrayed as worthy of derision through a rigidly hateful lens

the women are portrayed as the heroines in the narrative they ultimately rely on the promise of sex manipulation lies and cruelty as their tools and these are presented as positive attributes and tactics

its a film about a childrens doll made by a self indulgent director that will ultimately appeal to similarly miserable and unattractive middle aged women who are invited to identify with a very attractive lead star who deserves to make a lot of money out of the conceit",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC77h5e4PwL-NSGQZyajPRYg,0.9279,positive,True
2583,@user-wp3xm8gh5b,26/7/2023,4:43:57,0,"i never comment but had to put my two cents in ive literally been waiting for this movie to come out since 2016 i was a barbie collector and played with barbie throughout my childhood 
2023s arrival of barbie i knew it was going to be woke and it looked like it was going to have some really bad agendas but i still wanted to see it id waited too long  so i went expecting the worst but tried to have an open mind 
1 it was extremely feminist i knew it would be cant complain there 
2 sorry i didnt play with my kens either  so i could see what the joke was there about ken merely existing for barbie to look at him but i was not appreciating all the patriarchy baloney they had in the real world not all men are chauvinist  apparently barbie is insecure about who she is herself for feeling that all guys look at her for is her body  cause to me thats all a state of mind not saying guys dont look at girls in that 
3 sadly i dont think women could rule as peacefully or be as friendly to each other as that were like cats sorry   i also dont think women realize just how much power they have that they can also misuse cause lets face it where human and we just tend to misuse thingsa lot i mean us women really can make men fight like that and i think deep down we know it
4 the story wasnt really the best at least not for me after waiting this long for it to come out there truly was no character arc or reason for the mother and daughter to have a renewed relationship that whole story plot was sloppy and by the way that girl was a bully her friends seemed to literally be scared of her is that the attitude were expected to have because were independent strong women then i dont want it
5 i was surprised after leaving the theater that there wasnt actually as many bad agendas as i had already decided there would be there were actually some positive things but sadly some of the positive things were contradicted sobut id rather watch a movie and find the positive things these days because sadly there just isnt any more good movies

the normal feminist parts of the movie were so beautiful and the movie was hilarious until they came to the real worldand portrayed men as basically a bunch of babbling idiots that control the world unjustly funny thing is at the end of the movie when one of the men asks did they can have a seat in barbie congress the women say no and say when women can do that theyll be allowed

theres no law barring any woman from congress or from anything a man can doand the fact that barbie now knows what its like to be oppressedits insane that they still refuse to give men that opportunity and literally make something up to justify it 

if this movie wasnt heavily radically politicized then i would care that all the kens are idiots i actually thought it was hilarious until they made it clear that ken represents man

its absolutely disgusting to me that they had such a beautiful sentiment in embracing and loving your femininity as a woman but at the same time they tore men down and summed them up to just a bunch of stupid apes how dare you you have such a good message and tell the men and the boys in the theater that theyre basically trashyou supposedly want little girls to be empowered and that message is beautiful 

but the message this movie gives is that everybody should be confident and empowered and embrace themselves and their humanityunless youre a man you need to hyper focus on your toxicity and all men are dumb and crude there is a beauty in manhood just as there is in womanhood and thats the message you should be shouting from the rooftops i hope no little boy sees this movie and everyone involved should be ashamed",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBf8b3nfKkDVQtg-NbQZVIw,0.9849,positive,True

the whole movie does seem wokey or something up until ruths final speech to barbie it is more story about ideas and real life people created the idea of barbie a perfect girl who can perfectly do everything to kinda as movie said inspire girls and fix patriarchy but as we all know just productions of some dolls cant solve real world problems the difference between ideal idea of barbie and real life is comedically huge ideas sometimes meet here harsh reality that is not going to cater to them no mater how perfect ideas are 

and then we see a woman who used to be fascinated by barbie ideas who really got inspired by her and who got to live in real world which isnt obviously as perfect she has hard times in life and super annoying daughter and she does not look like perfect doll that she loves honestly most of her mindrewokibg speeches to brainwashed barbies do seem weird as a tool to unbrainwash anybody but she is just pointing out her struggles not all of them are relatable to anybody but at least one of them can touch heart of almost every woman  bc iust as in barbieland barbies have to be pretty and ken must be accessories in real world people also have some stupid standarts that they have to cater to the focus was on womens struggles but oh boy when those executives let themselves be themselves and just started tickling each other  it slightly tells us that men are not having perfect life either where they get to do everything they want it is just a slight innuendo but yeah it just shows us that creators are aware that societal expectations affect men as well the movie is just more about women in general

and then during final ruths speech we finally get told that barbie is just an idea barbie does not portray the real world yes irl women can be very beautiful and yes women can be presidentsjudgesdoctorswhoever you want but sugar sweet pink barbie world is just an idea and margo robbies barbies realisation of it looks like some stages of becoming an adult woman you get to know that not everything may be as perfect as barbie shows you still can achieve a lot but it doesnt come as easy look how ken tried landing a job  no matter partiarchy or not degree wins and you also understand at some point in your life that you have to become independent and live on your own separate from parents and leave childhood pink barbie fantasy in the childhood thats it as ruth says people dont live forever and whats most important in real world theres so much fun about life ideas may fight each other people may establish in barbieland patriarchy or matriarchy but the truth is that in real world the only thing impacted by barbieland is mattel business you can be happy and fulfilled in real world too you will have some struggles but as soon as you wont wish anything from the world for granted you will live a joyful life thats it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IKVYuMgTyOUpZUD7P1cdg,0.9974,positive,True

the propaganda of the patriarchy is so well established as true to feminists that theyve made themselves a movie about a woman who in the end moves beyond the societal pitfalls of patriarchy and matriarchy that the rest of the film exemplifies but doesnt quite manage to criticize in order to find her true self its like the fantasy of a strong female who doesnt need no man because shes amazing just as she is nested within the fantasy of the patriarchy

after all the only reason she was able to do the greatest things she did in the film is because she was just being herself she didnt have to grow or improve or change her behaviour just existing in this awful world is what changed her and made her loose herself and now she needs some time for herself

i will say maybe with this movie feminists will finally learn that a likable protagonist makes for a better film than a woman trying to act like all the stereotypes of a stoic man too bad theres no male counterpart the message that men and women should be equal was very much not

and instead of obtaining this information and using it for good he instead wants to rule over all the barbies in barbie land

i think this review just goes to show that we are all biased and looking at things through a specific lens amala says this herself 1147 barbie definitely missed the mark on some things but i honestly expected it to be so much worse and was pretty happy with it like the scene when ken goes off in the real world by himself he isnt treated specially in fact everywhere he tries to work requires experience and schooling and the scene shows a lot of women in higher positions so he takes back his idea of the patriarchy but kenland isnt whats shown in the real world 
and yall there is a lot of contradiction when it comes to being anyone in our society you cant just be a mom thats a waste of time but if you work too much and put your kids in daycare youre neglecting them etc there are contradictions on the other side too for men but thats not just woke feminist bs society is full of hypocrisy 
and the line that says maybe someday the kens will have as much power as women do in the real world or something like that i didnt think that was a joke that line stood out to me i thought wow theyre admitting that it really isnt that bad for women and the matriarchy of barbieland didnt seem like a good idealistic thing to me 
oh and the daughter yeah i think she was supposed to be unlikable the mother even calls her out for it 
i think the message that we should be able to be what we want to be or to put a more christian spin on it what were called to be without trying to fit into a box and please everyone was great and it wasnt just for the barbies amala left out the part where the barbies try to help the kens at the end telling them they dont need to have a barbie to be special they can just be themselves no one needs to fit into a societal box and lets face it most of the societal boxes nowadays are trash anyway so while the movie didnt hit the nail quite on the head my sister and i felt it was actually really good with some good messages 
again i think it all depends on the lense youre looking at it through it really hit home with my sister cause shes a stay at home mom of three who really struggles to feel like shes doing enough that shes good enough and i didnt think about it as deeply as she did but everything i just pointed out made sense to me  anyone else feel similarly",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZXeIomwB9AKU0hgjWOX36g,0.9943,positive,True

 first of all if you thought this movie was just going to be a fun plastic adventure im sorry but you clearly lack the ability to read between the lines i think that everyone i spoke to before watching the film went into it knowing it was going to have a feminist message which it did and part of it was including trans women the fact that it had a trans actress which played the role of a barbie doll and not a trans character is fresh good for the lgbtq community and very much feminist
 i do believe that even tho this film is not made specifically for children but for adults since it clearly has some sexual inuendos i believe that just like other films like shrek kids could watch this without getting creeped out since they wouldnt understand but also have fun with ir and maybe learn a thing or two
 im personally a man so i dont think i should expand a lot on the patriarchy theme specially seeing other comments here about that i can say that i have noticed how i have been benefited for being a man in the real world proving there to be at least a trace of it in western countries but i mostly want to extend on the fact that i went with three women of three different ages 16 20 and 31 and all three admitted to have somewhat a similar experience and agreed on experience sexism
 i dont think the overall message is that we should live in a matriarchy what so ever the whole point of the movie was to invert the gender roles in barbieland to see how stupid it is to have gender roles in the first place we see how it is ruled at first and how that makes kens feel proving that is not a fair society i took it as a way to exaggerate how some women feel sometimes and how a society where some gender rules over the other is just ridiculous they just overdramatise stuff just so that the younger audiences ger the general message and the adults have a laugh
 the role of women being pathetic plays on the barbie blond and stupid mindset it starts like that but eventually they realise their value and talents also i took the fact that they dont have kens as boyfriends as how barbie land is ruled by the pov of a young girl who would rather have a girls sleepover than kiss a boy or have a boyfriend
 being femenine doesnt make you a good man reflect on that yourself you cant talk about feminism and equality and demand men to fit your ideal masculine bearfighting qualities

in conclusion dont make a big deal out of it this movie maybe was made for people who could see maybe a bit further as out of the people i talked to of both genders non had the  feeling that this movie talked about anything but feminism overdramatic to make it entertaining more funny and specially ridiculous to carry the point across i feel like your review wasnt objective and you went to the theatre either with the idea of watching toy story or with your on prejudice",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHxnywLd6w5F3O1iO1bUKQw,0.9951,positive,True

3058,@robotdrz,25/7/2023,15:56:45,0,"i have to say i somewhat disagree i thought the barbie movie was really great and it did not come across to me as overly woke i entirely agree that this is not a kids movie but not due to overtly foul humor or bad messages being received yes there were double entendres and word play those have been snuck into actual kids movies for ages but i think the main reason it is not a kids movie is that the concepts it addresses are just too complex for kids to relate to i also understand your criticisms of the very feminized versions of men playing the ken dolls but i feel like it needs to be this way because this is a barbie movie it wouldnt make sense to have a super masculine gi joe type of character as ken because that is not what the ken dolls have historically been it wouldnt make sense in a barbie universe

i agree that the use of patriarchy was very overt but to me it felt like a comical take on patriarchy it really emphasized the most outlandish overt comical elements of what you would think about in terms of stereotypical patriarchy i think what the movie really addressed in a more serious way were the many challenges that we all face in modern life particularly where perceived societal expectations are concerned while they did more heavily focus on these expectations from the female perspective per american ferreras monologue in the movie as a man i found it relatable perhaps i am projecting but i think we all chafe against what we perceive as societys expectations of us or against the idea of what it means to be perfect it adds difficulty to life and at times it can make life feel impossible because perfection is an unobtainable goal

i would even go as far as to say that for the mens side of things i felt like this movie really gave a strong nod towards the fact that mens feelings and emotional needs are often undervalued particularly in modern times i think it was a good message that men arent solely defined by their partnerships or their jobs iamkenough

so yes there are woke concepts like patriarchy throughout the film but i feel like they were highly comical versions of those concepts if you take those at face value i could see the argument that this film is horrendously woke however i feel that it isnt meant to be taken at face value because the film really does hide a lot of complexity under that comedic surface i recommend it to adult audiences though as they are the ones who would pick up on these concepts",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5CfKvMjQnvGjTvfiXapsA,0.9957,positive,True

good bits the message that women can be anything they want to be to be honest i never thought of barbie representing this even as  child i always saw it as a doll with no waist big boobs and long legs that comes with a lot of accessories i could never really identify with them no gender is supposed to be oppressed by the other  which is what barbie realized when she came back and had a taste of her own medicine when the kens took over and when they restored barbieland  they learned from the mistakes and started to create a better society and i do agree that being a woman is hard it is hard to be a man too but hollywood made plenty of films about it already also i liked the fact that in this day and age somebody made a movie about the concept of a woman and the role of a woman and didnt try to blur the gender boundaries together no lesbians in the film how about that having gay characters in films is almost mandatory nowadays isnt it

3399,@andrewb8235,25/7/2023,12:29:39,0,this was a disappointing movie that exacerbates and encourages existing tensions between men and women it left me feeling that as a boy i was sold a false vision of feminism as an equalitarian movement when in fact the aim was and is an inversion of the patriarchy the movie doesnt culminate in a just society in which theres equal cooperation between the sexes instead the film proposes replacing patriarchy with an equally oppressive matriarchy ken is condescendingly instructed to develop a sense of self independent of women as if thats a novel insight that most men need to hear i dont know a single man who relies on women for his identity it was a revenge fantasy with the simple message men are trash a view commonly unabashedly expressed on social media and that a society in which men are  relegated to a subordinate status is utopia as a man what i find so dispiriting is the audience reaction viewed in context its apparent that the new aspiration of 4th wave feminism is the subjugation of men at a time when boys and young men are suffering immensely and performing worse than girls on most important metrics to make matters even worse heterosexual relationships are presented as inherently oppressive to women and therefore unappealing and incompatible with female empowerment i was sincerely saddened by this movie if this is the new feminism i no longer consider myself a feminist and if relations between the sexes are now a zerosum contest its inevitable that men will regard women as rivals not collaborators this is coming from someone who published a law review article defending roe v wade and the reproductive rights of women a very regressive take on feminism that is apparently celebrated by the vast majority of women relations between young men and women have never been more acrimonious and this fans the flames historical injustice does not legitimate punishing men indiscriminately especially young men who are largely supportive of female empowerment its not the movie itself so much as the fact that the movie reflects the broader current zeitgeist,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP6xIyiAYX-8qbf7fjrI8sQ,-0.8752,negative,True
3403,@tohuvabohugbanshee3962,25/7/2023,12:28:34,0,"the message that i got from the movie was that both the allman real world and allwoman barbie world are just two sides of the same coin and are equally horrible we should strive to cooperate something better a world where both sexes can feel truly appreciated and not trodden upon women should not feel the weight of patriarchy on their shoulders being seen as nothing more than incubators and mothers always looked down upon as not capable or strong enough to be anything other than caretakers and neither should men never feeling adequate constantly trying to prove their masculinity to feel lovedneeded  but switching patriarchy to a matriarchy is not a solution because for women it means feeling the pressure to achieve and constantly prove they are capable at everything when some may want to be stayathome mothers and will be perfectly happy with that and for men it means they are left out and not considered whole human beings kens in barbie world are like a decoration basically female dominated world is the reflection of maledominated world with roles reversed but having the exact same issues

the ken scene it doesnt feel good does it can be read both as a reflection of how women feel under patriarchy but it equally reflects what men will feel under female dominated world
im glad this movie happened because in the rush to fix patriarchy i believe were forgetting ourselves and are starting to strive toward female domination rather than true equality that wont fix any problems in the long run it will just create a yoyo effect because it only feeds the disillusionment and sourness of the men incels or whatever other deregatory labels are applied to them today who feel left out and that can end really ugly i believe this movie tries to show that and in that sense it definitely is woke because its trying to highlight a problem that both radical left and radical right pretend not to see

the answer is true equality treating others as humans not simply male or female listening and acknowledging that were both struggling with same problems anxieties and were both equally in need of love and acceptance for who we are not for what society expectsdemands from us to be i think thats what the movie was trying to convey sure it did uplift women why shouldnt it but the crucial scene was when gloria said that they should make a regular barbie that just is whatever she wants to be whether its the president or just a mom both should be fine and no one should have any issues with either choice in a truly equal world because the choice should come from the person making it not the society as long as our choice doesnt trample on the freedom of choice of others same applies to men men and women shoulndt compete every time all the time they should cooperate on equal terms where they can and mutually help each other in areas where one may be more adept than the other",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0YbpckdppoPZIopKPOPeUg,0.9916,positive,True

firstly i was actually looking forward to watching the movie because i thought maybe its like those old animated barbie movies and it surely looked joyful and happy which was very refreshing but of course i got played
once again femininity in behavior is portrayed as weak and bad and oppressive being nice to the kens and serving them beer oh noo how utterly terrible doing something nice for the person you love no thats misogynistic
also apparently it is impossible to be a woman unless youre a man then you can simply say you feel like one and get everything handed to you
the demonization of men in this movie is insane the fact that margot robbie doesnt even know what misandry is is also quite telling and how can this movie be so anti capitalist while desiring to make millions the logic aint logicing
ken only became a patriarchy desiring guy because the barbies were treating him and the other kens so badly just like how lots of men in our society are now mgtow or part of the manosphere not the grifters making the videos but the men watching them they were basically forced into this by feminism because they feel so hated by women
also showing women who are submissive and traditional as unintelligent and brainwashed is incredibly misogynistic in itself

it didnt show every man as a sexual predator  it showed some men behaving badly but also women behaving badly women at the beach mocking them sasha abusing her
the daughter shouldnt be taken seriously  she literally said that barbie destroyed their dreams that they can do anything when that is barbies entire history she wasnt someone were supposed to take seriously if you take anything a teenager says as fact in a movie or rl then you need your head checked she was just an opinionated teenager in an a movie for adults  no one expects adults to assume she is saying the truth of life  
it doesnt say that the current world is a patriarchy it shows someone taking a very short glance at the world and assuming that  even though if he payed attention to what was going on around him ie women could get jobs he couldnt because he wasnt qualified  and been a man was never enough   they didnt show a patriarchy  not in the real world   if anything it says dont take everything on face value  look a little closer   isnt that what those of use who say the patriarchy is bs are saying  look a little closer see the real world and youll see its not a patriarchy only a narrow shallow view sees that

the closest thing to a patriarchy they showed was all the men who ran mattel and that was a joke    just as the boardroom table at mattel been a heart and the ceiling was pink was a joke  or do people think that is real too

after seeing a world which is horrible where the kens serve the barbies we now see another world which is horrible  where the barbies serve the kens  neither are actually shown as good   anyone who thinks the world presented when the barbies were in charge was good what movie were they watching  it showed that kens only purpose was barbie he had no life no value  she treated him like crap and that was shown  it showed that barbie saw nothing wrong with it but on the outside it was clearly a sad existence  

ill grant i didnt like the message they used to deprogram the barbies  some of it is accurate though mostly struggles women put on themselves not that men do but i did roll my eyes a little  as well as distracting the kens by making them fight big eye roll there but it doesnt change the overall message

it actually has a good message it isnt that we live in a patriarchy  its not we should live in a matriarchy
its we should have equality and that treating the other as lesser is not good or positive  whether that is the barbies treating the kens badly they did or the kens treating the barbies badly which they did  
it even ended with the kens been given a lessor role than barbies but maybe one day theyll too reach the achievements of women in the real world  the context been having both genders on the supreme court  guess what  we do have women on the supreme court they are not been left only on the lower courts   

i dont consider myself a feminist  most feminists drive me crazy because they dont equality they want dominance  i dont subscribe to the patriarchy its bs  absolute bs 
this movie had a couple eye roll movements but the idea that it is all profeminist and prowomenantimen no 

its protreat everyone with decency and everyone has worth  female and male

listening to people i usually respect come out with such we must hate the left trope im kind embarrassed for them  talk about not been able to look at things with a clear mind

first off i think it needs to be recognised that the portrayal of the real world was in fact done in a way that took elements of real world patriarchal behaviour because it does exist and exaggerate it to drive home a point that in the real world women do get sexually assaulted by no fault of their own they do get placed on the sidelines of decision making in corporate set ups because men tend to question their abilities just because theyre women and they do struggle with what feels like the impossible and fickle standards that society has placed on them that speech was right on the money for me in our world men trans men seem to be better at being women that women do how so for me the exaggeration wasnt something i took as is i took it to mean yeah these things do happen
the other thing is barbie land is a reflection of the real world but its a matriarchy of which i could see from watching it that it was not the way to go either this is evidenced by how distraught and unseen and unfairly treated the kens were the simple question from the womans daughter so where do the kens live highlights this unfairness though subtly  we see what a matriarchy would do to men through kens journey it would make them angry and theyd lash out the movie for me was self aware in this way and rather than glorify either matriarchy or patriarchy had a fun and feels inducing approach towards calling for there to be balance in as much as the barbies get their matriarchy back as a viewer i didnt see that and think yeah this is ideal and i think that was the movies way of saying just like the real world ey because yes women arent under the thumbs of men as youve put it in the real world but things are still verrrry verrry far from ideal so gripes be had this was a great movie for me and id see it again because as a woman i felt cautioned to see myself and my  struggles but was also reminded to see the men around me and their struggles

i really enjoyed the beginning when they go to the real world  mattel even when they go back to barbieland its kind of funny and ironic that ken wants to change the world though that doesnt reflect the original idea of ken either but it was bizarre and funny 

then when the barbies start to manipulate the kens its when i didnt understand the movie anymore and i felt like it lost the original idea or charm left for a barbie movie i dont think patriarchy or matriarchy has anything to do with the barbie world at least how i recall it i didnt see the connection or meaning behind it i dont know if they had little time to finish the script but they couldve gone in another direction 
then in the end when she is reunited with the doll creator i guess it made sense again because its something that barbie would do  but thats it right in the middle of the movie its very bizarre stupidserious that you dont know if its on purpose or not

this may shock some but barbieis not the far left woke propagandafest so many american conservatives claim it is neither is it the opposite

its actually very south parkesque in its approach it takes the piss out of all extremist viewpoints on both sides its what woke people would describe as transphobic yet one of the barbies is trans its what misogynists would describe as misandrist yet showcases misandry as being just as real as misogyny its what classic feminists would describe as antimotherhood while defending the fact that its okay to want to be a mother despite what libfems would have you believe

essentially its telling you that patriarchy doesnt work and that the answer isnt matriarchy either its telling you that liberal feminism doesnt work because actual feminism is about equality not supremacy its telling you that the real world isnt as black and white as males rule everything or males ought to rule nothing

this reality they try to portray in the film cannot be sustained in the real world the real world is not about female or maless emotions and dreams the real world is about survival and this happens by assuming your role that you are better at as a women or man it is about teaming up it requires a menwomen team to build an airplane

all the women i met they loved it more when i made them submissive and feminine they were the most happy i dont mean into abusing way as everybody wants to see today a man should be a man a women shold be a women they hated it inside when they had to take the leadnot sexy they told me a lot about the experiences with the other guys

i dont think we need feminism or man rights stuff they are useless because the evolving of the society has already made many places for women to study and work we just need for both women and men to have access to school or jobspoverty areas and both of them to be payed by how much work they do and what job they have

ultimately is better to want them to be happy together and to get along instead of outsmarting other person which happens because of feminism or man rights activists ideas you are wasting your youth years to follow such ideas women were very happy before femimism and they are very happy in countries where there is no feminismask them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUiOISxJcJS6OlvtuiMW0ug,0.9685,positive,True

im always amazed how within the same breath modern feminists will complain they are oppressed while holding a range of different power positions in society and actively degrading and disparaging men at every chance they get doesnt matter if the man is good they will still crap on them and treat them horribly cause misogyny exists and this has been a very common mindset among the selfproclaimed feminists of today for a while and they wonder why redpill male communities are popping up like crazy its pretty much these types of women that have only pushed men farther and farther away cause who wants to be around someone who is going to mentally and emotionally abuse you constantly and yeah a lot of these women are mentally and emotionally abusive toward men and frankly i dont want them anywhere near young boys 

kind of feels like a coopt of any personal responsibility taken to any situation a feminist ever finds themselves in and most average people arent really paying attention to how sexist this movie is toward men cause they are love blinded to nostalgia of seeing all the barbie stuff onscreen which is sad can you imagine if they made a gi joe or other male dominated action figure movie with this same concept reversed trashing women and then in the end still just trashing women if any woman truly believes that this is how all men operate they clearly surround themselves with just bad men and have no idea about men at all theyve become prisoners of their own fear",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfXK2EOlGsLXg8XHVz1-gZg,-0.9152,negative,True

3963,@RoseyVamp,25/7/2023,4:38:55,0,"i have had so many mixed feelings about this film and while this video gets some things right it also missed a few points i want to highlight 
so first the film tried to say that the real world isnt a truepatriarchy at least not the way ken wants it to be and thats why he goes back to barbieland to make it kendome yes it horribly portrays men and i hate how every man barbie encounters either sexualizes her or belittles her but there is a point where ken is trying to get a job and he cant because he doesnt actually have the qualifications to do so like an md or phd and the person who tells him he cant have a job because hes not qualified even points out how more women are earning degrees than men this leads him to think that he needs to bring patriarchy to barbieland because in his words the real world isnt doing patriarchy correctlysecond there are multiple times in the film where barbie seems to question what the other barbies and the humans she brought there are doing to take back barbieland they just never went anywhere with those looks of guilt and concern there was also a scene where ken tells barbie how does it feelwhen she first sees his takeover and it sets up the idea that the two are going to come to an understanding that neither treated each other well but then the film makes her apologize while he just whines and cries until he miraculously acceptshimself  and ofc the line where the president tells the kens that they can have a small inconsequential seat on the supreme court that was the final nail in the coffin they couldve turned everything around with the third act but instead it just completely ruined itself and made the entire message of the film the very thing everyone who has even an ounce of common sense feared 
it was like the movie wanted to go there in terms of equality but clearly got bulldozed over with an overtly sexist message of how men and women cant strive to be equal one most dominate its really sad and disheartening too because at the end of the day i think so many people were hoping that this was going to be a film that finally was just fun and witty while maybe also pushing back against the crazy over the top narrative from rad feminism and manosphere spaces that men and women have to fight for dominance and neither can be equal just overall a disappointment and a film i hope will eventually fade into obscurity

pros
funny movie a lot of funny jokes
the art and the set is amazing
amazing costumes as well
they really did honor a lot of barbie toys in and it was nostalgic
margot robbie and ryan gosling performances of their characters were great 

cons
a lot of unnecessary and useless characters the whole mattel crew sasha
plot all over the place
very stereotypical and dumb portraying of patriarchyand men
the word patriarchy is said like 100 times 
a lot of very soulless and bland feminist speeches
the type of existentialism portrayed is very clich and doesnt leave that deep of a message
too much effort in marketing art costumes etc and lazy writing of the story

so overall is a funny movie but nothing that deep or super interesting about it

this movie gave me clearer perspective about patriarchy and feminsm that i didnt know before and at some point i came to an enlightment that wow this is really happened to me people may hate this movie bcs they think its exaggerating and antagonizing men but i dont think so bcs in my country especially in my hometown patriarchy is real what was shown on the movie is trully how women get treated by the majority of men and its true that men are not allowed to show their vulnerability that leads to higher suicide rate among them barbie movie may not give huge impact for american people since they have already exposed by this movement much earlier but for woman in my country where patriarchy is so dominant this movie really helps us to understand more about our worth as women that we were not just born to serve men get pregnant and we are not just belong to the kitchen women can be anything they want and they are equal to men in term of intelligence and soft skill and it also taught me that men have right to show their emotion and being vulnerable

secondly if another movie was made that supposedly was satirical where all men enslaves all women treat them as second class citizens and make a broad statement that all women are only good for is reproduction cooking and cleaning  will such a movie be allowed to exist

lastly anyone who thinks the opening box office weekend is result of misleading marketing and hiding the movies feminist ideology you should have a better read on the audience reactions at cinemas and the social media discussions  this movie resonates with a significant part of the female population in western countries  regardless of which end of the political spectrum they cant help resist the ego boost and the fantasy of power

if you are a men or boy in western society this should a another in a long line of warnings being slammed in your face  this is representative of a significant part of how western women thinks in 2023  this is their power fantasy this makes them feel empowered you should heed this and move accordingly  if you choose to continue to ignore this do so at your own peril",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoWmY5_RznFyZ6oKoVIDkwg,-0.5659,negative,True

1 the patriarchy is really a nonthreat joke
2 men need a sense of community and purpose in order to feel fulfilled simping just leaves them feeling weak and actually turns women off
3 the first thing women will do is start wars getting men to fight each other
4 voting fraud is an acceptable means of gaining power
5 after women finally get the world they want they will feel a longing for and want to return to the patriarchy

in some ways the movie is interesting because despite its outwardly woke speeches and messaging the events and resolution in the movie run completely counter to the woke narrative this is probably why the show is popular and entertaining because relatable stories actually run counter to the woke narrative its an interesting look at what is really behind leftist ideology and the world they intuitively know they will ultimately createits right there in the film wars disenfranchisement unfulfillment but the best trick its pulled complaining about capitalism in order to get you to spend more money on stuff brillant movie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsYQUIy1C2pUmiM92mrl9vw,0.8745,positive,True

i agree that the film is probably not for younger audiences who wouldnt get irony  if the movie wasnt meant to be ironic though thats another story but thats the way i took it and looking at it that way i think its great 
a lot of the ways the barbies and kens were acting though reminded me so much of when i was a kid and played with them i found that so clever  again if it was meant as a clever thing

barbie is a female product and toy so of course everything will be womencentred in their satire universe but whats great is that they realised that kens the men were treated unfairly and deserve an identity of their own not just an accessory figure next to your barbie toy the whole barbie is everything hes just ken slogan on its own sounds like a dig at men which i get however when you think about it this self awareness kinda makes you realise that this slogan was meant to represent how bad the mindset of barbies and barbieland treated them in the movie which they learned to change in the end i believe it stands for equality 

ken was made out to seem like the villian for a bit but we find out in the end that he isnt a villian hes just hurt left out and misunderstood and the barbies needed to realise they were in the wrong and should fix things i think men would relate to feeling out of place in this modern feminist world and would feel validated seeing the kens fighting back and in the end being shown how misunderstood they feel and that barbie apologising and making things right will further validate the male audience even more in my opinion definitely a very deep multilayered movie and i think a lot of these concepts may have gone over peoples heads but idk but yeah the word patriarchy was used a bit too many times for my liking lol",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRjLq1lmH0xrP6gbWIbBCg,0.683,positive,True

ken started a patriarchy because he saw men in the real world treated with respect and his perception of men ruling the world was taken down by the movie itself as ken couldnt succeed by his gender alone 

the patriarchy ken started wasnt literally a patriarchy but was symbolic of feminisms current direction it showed that an oppressed class weather truly oppressed or only oppressed in their perception did not benefit from gaining full control and reversing roles that was not the solution

like the kens in barbieland are secondclass citizens right they dont hold any positions of power or own property maybe barbie straight up doesnt even know if ken is homeless or not or seem to care so theyre equivalent to women irl thats explicitly confirmed at the end where the narrator jokes that eventually theyll reach the same level of power women have irl so the kens are an oppressed group who learn that things can be better from very flawed sources of course and try to change things so theyre on top and it goes horribly and then they learn that its actually better to return things mostly to how they were that theyre happier if they stay secondclass citizens
also ken was unhappy with the status quo from the very beginning long before he encountered the patriarchy so it seems like the matriarchy was what harmed him initially the patriarchy probably actually made things better for him overall
so im not really sure how you can even say the movie had a coherent message about patriarchy the setting just conflicts with it too much it presents a world where men are secondary to women but then still wants to portray them as whiny privileged babies and i think that as a result it actually gives pretty damn shitty messages about power and oppression",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJSiZPnNr2Jfv4RGVmUcUQ,0.8564,positive,True

then a male friend of mine started talking to me about the movie basically saying that he would have preferred the getting to know this world movie where barbie was just amazed at everything probably introduced to this world by a man and he thinks the momdaughter duo had too much screen time the movie is supposed to be about barbie also that just ken line is so misandric and they didnt equate kens to barbies at the end talking about equality

that was the moment i put on my hot pink tight minidress and held my stilettos in my hands as weapons yes its basically a longass toy commercial but its better than the tragedy that could have been i think that gerwig at least got to show something where barbie had some agency and the focus wasnt really barbie but real women 

men crying because of the just ken line have clearly never played with barbies and have never suffered real discrimination no person not even the boys who played with barbies has ever said i wanna be ken its nothing against men its that playing with barbies is a way to project yourself into the future and explore who you wanna be it has nothing to do with ken he wasnt even part of the original plan he was only given to barbie because conservators were concerned about an unmarried woman going around with her life

the entire movie we are told that barbie world and the real world are complete opposites when it comes to gender roles ken tries to take over barbie world and is told he just needs to accept it and smile more 
barbie is not a feminist movie it tells us in real time how women are worthless in a mans world we dont belong and if we tried to do anything against it it would just be bad for everyone else ken brainwashes the barbies into being housewives the basic things men will say is all they want from their wives after they got to hang out with the kids all day at home the least they can do is drop everything when the man steps in the house to greet them to men our sole purpose in the world is to serve men support them and hold our hands over corners so they dont bump their heads like little children we are meant to be mothers and thats it barbie doesnt dispute that it reinforces the idea by making ryan gosling do it so it looks like a crap on men but its a crap on women 
so ken accepts it and goes back to being just ken because all women want in the real world is to be told they are enough and they will go back to being quiet 
barbie decides to go back to be a human not to prove that women can do great things she realizes that being an astronaut in barbie world is not being an astronaut its playing dress up no barbie was ever actually in space fixed a car or was a doctor they just wore the outfits every barbie movie shows us that barbies were only ever princesses seamstresses and princess seamstresses we are told that barbie won an award but we never see it its just a word on a box that is meaningless because no little girl looks at dentist barbie and wants to become a dentist because the kid wouldnt even know what that means barbie just wears the outfit thats it 
barbie goes to the real world because she has felt emotions she has seen that barbie world is no different than the real world women are meant to be distracted with glitter and pink but at least in the real world she can die at the end that is why she wants to be human she saw whats on the other side of the brainwash and decided she wants to die she goes to the real world gets in line to do human things until her clock runs out just like the rest of us 

barbie is a depressing movie not just because of the message it sends but because it screams it at us so blatantly and proves to us that women are easy to distract when you show them some glitter and pink its depressing seeing grown adults take pictures of themselves in a lifesize barbie box after just being told to be quiet and comfortable and they do just that and they will go the next day and watch it again",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxAEGzef47PezFhKP18LNMA,-0.2551,negative,True

companies marketing social justice is problematic because they do not enact change within the company but it is beneficial because they heed and shape modern cultural values the fact that social justice is trendy is not a bad thing 
vain woke marketing strategies will help grow public dissatisfaction with the system that feeds these companies if society values justice then as we move forward it will become harder for corporate to pretend to advocate for it capitalism is far more effective at influencing society than alternative avenues and in a way we have seized it to our benefit companies need us to buy their products and what sells is justice we wanted things to change and now the biggest platform is championing change even if it is superficially

i left the cinema feeling extremely lukewarm towards it and as it happens with internet phenomenoms the mass reaction has made me feel more visceraly about it than i would otherwise it was bland surface feminism and worse it tried to be something else than a fun movie it had just enough winkwonkness to astonishningly make people believe they received any message about womanhood at all nevermind that mattel actually dislikes the word feminism and has go to lenghts to deprive girlbossism of any sharp teeth not marketeable but make it present in their products nonetheless 
the right wing reactions made me think i was going to see something of substance  and to be clear i never considered it necessary for the movie to be anything but fun with dolls  and it is almost reason to despair than some  people seem to agree that there was something to gain from its pop magazine 2006 pink liberal feminism  

i have seen takes that fail the media literacy test just as much as the reactionaries and the only difference is that positive delusion that they just watched a revelationtm if people like it because music and pink wonderful but to read essays on the depth of this movie everywhere i go i only sink further into actually i hate this fucking movie 

i wish ken was just ken the movie is more about him than it is about the mom and daughter or even barbie his feelings his arc his resolution amazing anyone thought this movie was anti men  i wish ken was closer to what the interviews with ryan goslin made it seem and closer to the truth that girls just dont care as much for him when theyre playing not out of any malice there is no interest barbies journey to realness is interrupted and it spends a looooong time on his issues and his coup de etat instead of you know solidifying what it was supposedly central to the movie 

i wish the play on the real world being the opposite wasnt so haha mysoginy that they ended up implying being an ordinary woman is less than what already is like the scientists the writers the doctors the volunteers all of those women absolutely exist in real life and are not extraordinary or impossible and let me be clear her speech is not on cellulitis or bad hair her pitch is  a mom and maybe some job or not a mom or a mom or not a job just a woman or a mom paraphrased but yikes but it would defeat the purpose i suppose to let greta know that ceo women are scarce but do already exist and havent fixed much

anyway this movie is empty aesthetics but instead of just the fun aesthetics it takes the time to trick the audience into thinking that it addresses any social issue at all and i fucking hate that it worked  and i fucking hate that people will knife you for suggesting that it was mediocre writing and thematically meh and will make up a better movie in their heads and kill you for disliking it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqF4MtLS4nr5TohM4l7ezEg,0.5674,positive,True

5267,@QuintessentialQs,14/8/2023,23:49:14,4,"im really saddened because i think there really is a much more subversive thing going on in the barbie movie than you get from the narrator spoonfeeding you the message of  the movie  thats a distraction

barbieland a sort of astral reflection of the barbie brand was created as a solution to the patriarchal status quo of the 1950s  this gives us the notion of aspirational representation as a solution to the problems of patriarchy as such
even still barbie as a brand is a product created within a patriarchal capitalist system and ultimately serves that system to generate profit  barbie cannot radically reenvision gender roles as such because the hierarchical classbased system which produced her lacks the imagination to do so  so the best thing that can be imagined from within that system is a mere inversion of the problem rather than the solution a system where women are men and men are women in terms of class and only the aesthetics are reversed
but barbieland is outdated  the world where no kens have any jobs of importance and are mere accessories to barbies isnt even an accurate inversion of the world today  in some ways the real world has indeed progressed so that there are women doctors and lawyers and supreme court justices  that wasnt an oversight on the part of gerwig and baumbach it was deliberate  barbieland is outdated and outmoded because the barbie brand is outdated and outmoded  thats a big part of why so many people seem to bounce off the brand today
barbieland experiences a dialectical crisis  its contact with the outside world brings in nuances and difficulties that challenge the naive false utopia  the first step in that dialectic is pure negation or antithesis which looks something like the world that barbie was originally reacting against  it is pointed out however that the undoing of kens patriarchy is built into its very structure  this is a reference to marxs theory of history that the contradictions within each configuration of human society contain the shape of its inevitable end and that the expression of these contradictions creates the next stage in development
thus it is through the expression of contradictions the kens need to compete with one another and the impossibility of womanhood that it falls apart  and the mattel executives arrive to help construct the next stage for barbieland
the ultimate solution is that the barbies reassert control and mattel decides to release some more nuanced barbie products only with the assurance that this will continue to generate profit  barbieland is changed but it is again made into a mere inversion of the real world where the kens will be slowly more represented in the barbie power structure but that structure will not be radically changed
barbie cant actually fix patriarchy because its a product of an oppressive capitalist system  and the only way robbies barbie can enter the world in a way that has real meaning is to stop being a product and instead become human  she cannot retain the level of complexity she reached within the confines of the brand
so its her acceptance of impermanence of imperfection of recognition which transitions her from object to subject with agency in the real world  perhaps not the agency to fix everything but at least with the agency to do literally anything at all which is more than can be said for the barbie brand

but i dont think most people have taken that from the movie because they are either so stupid and ideological that they cant even apprehend the really obvious messages presented by the narrator right wing chuds mostly or they just kinda stopped looking for anything deeper out of cynicism and assuming there was nothing more under the hood most left wing critique ive seen",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHVTJDJmkEvTRF0q_I4rTUQ,-0.6527,negative,True

i think verilybitchy did a pretty good video on the barbie movie though i didnt agree with everything it just is riddled w white feminismwhite savior ideology and perpetuates the harmful notion that comes along with performative activism that as long as youre aware of something theres not really anything you need to change like sorry but making a joke about tax evasion doesnt make that any less of a crime maam in the same vein making a joke about how margot robbie is so stunning that its silly to think she could feel ugly doesnt mean that casting her is not pushing stereotypical beauty standards also there were just some incoherent scenes when i first watched the movie i thought that the bus stop scene was really sweet cause barbie probably never saw an old lady before and their interaction was so wholesome but in retrospect thats the same barbie that freaked out over some cellulite 

also barbierworld is embarrassing for mattel if u ask me they had a handful of black people a girl in a wheelchair a fat barbie and a weirdbut still unthreatening  barbie oh and the pregnant barbie who was discontinued and conveniently not really part of the movie after she was introduced to me barbieworld still read very cishet conventionally attractive and able so i dont really think mattel should be that proud of their diversity there

i kind of expected this going in to see it i was sure it was going to become a cultural phenomenon and in that i felt it was similar to going to see mamma mia you dont expect your mind to be blown by any serious intellectual message but fun and maybe themes on the female experience

speaking of the female experience i think the most positive surprise about the film to me was the mothers existential crisis and how that challenged what perfection or a perfect life was like barbies turn from doll to human signified to me her decision to be her own imperfect self instead of somebody elses definition of perfect i wish that theme was more developed within the movie it mainly only shows up in the beginning when barbies legs change and the end with the obgyn gag and is less discussed during the middle part imo this whole madness with ken could have been dropped the movies true antagonists should have been who tried to put barbie in a box metaphorically expectations of a woman not just the suits instead of ken",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfCMVWAqzLpMVIAuQAr-UMA,0.9859,positive,True

not only did i find it kind of ironic that the movie wants mattels ceo to seem like a bumbling profit driven joke but also a champion of women and little girls dreams but also because mattels less gimmickyconcept driven and more ordinarybarbies havent been selling as well with little girls and andult collectors alike since around the 2010s 

in part because were all glued to screens like broey said haha but also because a lot of people with nostalgia for barbie and other dolls and toys in the same niche have been craving that whimsy of older releases and not just nostalgia or branding they want creativity even at the end of the movie mattel is still headed by a boring man in a pink tie and the offices are full and gray

i just found it funny as a person who knows a lot about barbie and her history and keeps up with the dolls but doesnt buy them anymore that it felt like they were trying to argue that their newer business model was more feminist as if feminism has to be plain and boring and lacking any sort of nuance

it makes you feel like if you dont like the newer barbie dolls even though theyre criticized for being cheap and uncreative you must just hate women and same goes for the movie

the game itself has got nothing but positive feedback however i kept on getting rejection after rejection after rejection of game publishers because i kept on getting told teenage girls wasnt a viable target audiencemy friends who were also female directors also with amazing games had similar conversations 

so i think theres a lot of talk of selling out or not being perfect but i could only imagine the red tape of getting a lot of stuff approved so yes its sanitised yes it kinda goes against its core message yes it drops the ball with some characters  the ceo that was eeek but i think it took enough of a step forward so maybe creators like me  my fellow indie devs who are creating games for not just white dues can finally be told our audiences are viable

i think its unfortunately one reason theres a lot of recent movies that slack off with the actual quality of storytelling if the studio thinks its enough that they advertise a strong female lead or minoritycentered cast  and too many colleagues in their circles are unwilling to give earnest critical feedback if they risk dogmatic accusations that they just must hate women or whoever 

stories need diversity and quality 

i was really optimistic that gerwigs movie would be cleverly subversive and at least have a progressive message  i was all on board with the opening narration 
but my date and i were very disappointed and discouraged by how badly it portrays feminism in the end

5547,@wynteranderson3572,9/8/2023,4:13:00,11,this is why i felt like i needed a couple days after seeing the movie before i engaged with any criticism of it because while i do love hearing other peoples perspectives on things like moviesbookstvshows i had so mutch fun with barbie like i couldve done without the crying baby in the theatre but even with that i laughed so hard that by the end my mouth hurt from laughing and smiling so mutch i walked out of the theatre with a genuine sense of euphoria and felt just happy for the first time in months i knew going in that it is a movie designed to sell toys from mattel and that despite being directed by greta gerwig it wasnt excatly going to be the subversive feminist masterpiece like some people hoped it would be and the marketing of the movie kind of leaned into because well its a movie made by mattel about barbie who is our favorite captalist girl boss i knew all of this but after seeing the movie i was just too happy to feel cynical and i knew that if i heard these talking points while still feeling that it would feel like a personal attack even though logically i know it isnt it would feel like the critics were purposely trying to take the happiness i felt while waching and be like see arent you so dumb for enjoying this imperfect movie or such a terrible person for supporting such a blatantiy capatalistic movie i would never do that i have moral principles and am better than you in every way even though of course they would just be stating their opinions which im free to disagree with i needed time to figure out how i felt about the movie just as a movie without all the mattelcapatalism stuff and came to the conclusion that while it had great performances music productioncostume design it definitely had issues story wise in that it didnt know what it wanted to focus on did it want to be about ken and how the patriarchy harms men to or about the struggles of modern womanhood did it want to be about extentensial dread and what it means to be human or a comedy about goofy mattel excutives or did it want to be about a motherdaughter relationship or did it just want to shallowly criticize barbie so you can feel good about purchasing the overpriced movie merchandise like yeah i did like america ferreras speech because while yes it was on the nose it was true being a woman is full of impossible contradictions and ideals that are impossible to live up to however from a story standpoint it doesnt make much sense because the audience knows next to nothing about america ferreras character except she works at mattel is a barbie fangirl is married and has a tween daughter the women in the audience are just supposed to project theire issuestrauma associated with womanhood on to her so it lessens the impact of what the speech was going for despite this i still liked the movie and could see myself watching it again and i especially liked the billie eilish song what was i made for even though i wouldnt really consider myself a billie eilish fan i also love the im just ken song and have listened to them both repeatedly and will do so again in fact i have a feeling film people are going to hate me because the last film i saw in theatre was the northman a movie that objectivily has more artistic integrity and was a film that just wanted to be art without being based on an existing ip and trying to sell you something i can acknowledge that and heres where the film buffs are going to come for me of the two movies i saw the one ive wanted to watch again is barbie the only reason i havent seen it in theatres twice is because going to the movies is expensive and the cheapskate in me cant justify spending money to see a movie that i already saw in theatres just a couple weeks ago with all that being said god i dont want the mattelaverse or barbie sequals like just no im not suprised that mattel is going to try to launch it im just disappointed and think people will get worn out just as they are with disney lifeaction remakes and superhero movies yet they will still make money and the 2030 biggest movies of the year will probably be uno 2 uno reverse and the live action aristocats movie that looks godawful but still made a billion dollars somehow idris elba will win an oscar for his groundbreaking performance as the uno reverse card needless to say i will only be consuming the polly pocket lena dunham movie through youtube videos because i have never been so intrigued as to how a movie is going to turn out while being so simultaneously disinterested in actually watching it for me the barbie movie comes with so many mixed opinions i know its not very anticapitalist of me but a part of my inner child is so excited that this movie sparked a new intrest in barbie as someone who regrets giving away all the dolls i owned with the exception of my american girl dolls because those things are expensive just because i felt i needed to because i didnt want to be like those other girls even though i am just like those other girls even beyond just the dolls i like that this movie has allowed barbiecore to become a thing and that people are like you know what yeah its ok to like feminine things and doing that doesnt diminish your intelligence i like that with barbie greta gerwig is going to be in the top five of highest grossing movies dericted by women because thats an impressive accomplishment i like that barbinheimer got people to see movies in theatres and that going to see barbie manged to become such a communal experience in my showing when the credits of the movie started rolling a woman shouted i love you barbie and while i suspect that she was in all likelihood drunk a part of me wanted to shout along with her i like that barbie is going to be the top movie of the summer instead of say the little mermaid or fast x or antman quantamaina but i despise the overpriced merchandise and of course the upcomming mattelverse and yeah to say the success of barbie or oppenheimer or barbinheimer if you will is a win for the future of original storytelling is a blatant falsehood because while barbie is an original story its an original story about a beloved toy made by the company that produced said toy that got made so it could sell more of said toy and oppenheimer is a biopic that just happens to be  made by a popular director like still not a win for orginallity guys im sorry i guess if i had to some up my feelings for barbie it would be that even if it makes me problamatic im glad it got made because i really needed to feel joy like that even for a fleeting moment after months of feeling nothing but a growing sense of hopelessness for the future as well as some existential ennui although it is far from a perfect movie wholly immune to critisism though in 2030 when idris elba gives his heartfelt speech while holding his oscar for playing the titular uno reverse card in uno 2 uno reverse and all the scripts are written in ai ill curse my younger self for being carried away by nostagila and i will buy a copy of the barbie dvd just so i can burn it like ben shapiro burnt those overpriced barbies from the film deny i ever enjoyed any part of the movie and then of course go on x to x about how james corden should have won the oscar instead of idris elba for his role as the aristocat in the liveaction cgi aristocats movie im kidding but i guess what im saying is in a vacum on its own i like the barbie movie as a movie despite its story issues even if that makes me a dumb plebeian who will never know how to enjoy true cinema because my brain is to tiny to comprehend and the film bros proclaim me as everything wrong with the average movie goer but i do hate that at its core its a movie made just for the purpose of selling merchandise and i already know i will hate all of the future entries into the mattelaverse especially the barney movie because that sounds like something pulled strait from my childhood nightmares even to this day as an adult barney creeps me the f out anyway sorry if anyone chose to read this novel length comment and for the typos i know i made i just

 making barbies arc all about putting ken and the kens back in their place as an underclass

 featuring uplifting quotes such as everyone hates women and it is impossible to be a woman

 including a plot point where a group of barbies immediately drop their strong identities to become kens slaves including some dressed as french maids 

i am a feminist and i dont need my feminism to be tied to putting down the men around me nor do i need it to be tied to this idea that life is impossible for women i grew up in the era of spice girls buffy xena warrior princess sailor moon i was eating girl power for breakfast from the age of 5 i dont need anyone to tell me dont be a mans plaything because it never occured to me that i needed to be that i also hate that it implied that being a woman in a firstworld country is the hardest thing to be dont insult my intelligence like that 

if they wanted to focus on barbies existential crisis they needed a better solution to that solution than defeat the patriarchy  but i would have preferred if barbie was more about the escapism and believing anything is possible i wish the movie had been more about barbie teaching the world you can be a powerful and independent woman who loves pink you are only limited by your imagination a la elle woods from legally blonde than it was about the world teaching barbie actually the world sucks for women might as well get used to it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNV7xA-husQufvb6sbDldA,0.8391,positive,True

i think your criticisms are unfair and dont appreciate the movie for what it is i think its incredible that a massively popular brand produced a mainstream movie that had frank depictions and conversations ofabout feminism male fragility female friendships and motherdaughter relationships and was a huge hit its a major deal that a wellestablished brand wants to rebrand to be more inclusive and continue representing girls and women in almost every imaginable workplace sport hobby interest etc i agree with the commentor who said that they hope barbie and oppenheimer encourage studios to make movies that dont have a sequel number attached to it 

barbie and oppenheimer are the first movies ive seen in theaters since gerwigs little women in 2019 if they hadnt come out i still would be staying out of the theater and holding onto my 12 ive literally never seen a movie like barbie before and i hope more movies from more female andor queer voices walk through the door that greta gerwig has used her privilege to open i can only hope that the strikers and their unions can affect change that us moviegoers crave


additionally i loved being part of a collective experience for something that was diseaserelated or politicsrelated i was dressed all in pink and was surrounded by dozens of other people who were also dressed up i was laughing and clapping with strangers it felt like i was part of something fun and fresh and beautiful i also cant imagine someone watching this movie and not dying laughing one moment and then tearing up the next you didnt enjoy the movie did you also not like the original music the gorgeous costumes the colorpopping sets you didnt get something out of it you didnt feel moved at all im genuinely baffled at how you werent moved by america ferraras monologue thats so insane to me

this is probably how greta gerwig feels right now 
just because she didnt turn barbie into a semester long course on feminism doesnt mean its antifeminist not saying nobody can critique this movie but comparing to how women are usually shown in the media male gaze no agency etc why is this the piece of media that we are all being incredibly picky with
especially since it portrays women in a light funny powerful way 
its not a perfect movie and thats okay

a lot of friends i talked about the movie with have expressed that it really made them aware of many things they hadnt seen as problems tied to their womanhood or put those into better words they couldnt express beforehand what they also took from the movie is the idea that its enough to just be a woman which is totally right in a way but misses the point of feminist struggle that we as feminist are not guaranteed to be just that that the world is actively trying to restrict women and men in what they can be how they should act what they deserve

its ok to call out people who seem to be part of the problem i understand that if they dont do it someone else will but it feels pretentious to go around saying barbie is gonna change the world or barbie is a landmark in creative cinema it sucks to see people you like doing this  people like margot robbie ryan gosling grega gerwig   my little women heart cried a little but its understandable to not give up on the money because as a female director she did make history  and in a world where money is all that counts crossing 1 bn dollars seemed great no ones gonna ask where that money went tho and how would it be used

what i dont agree with is that oppenheimer isnt doing the same maybe they wont sell you a doll but all mass media production is selling and idea and this movie is trying to sell to the world that we should forgive some of the people involved in the massacre that was the dropping of the 2 abombs in japan at the end of wwii that the usa has a critical view now about those events and the way its portrayed made me feel like they cant really believe were buying this bs but i guess not some and most ppl watching it are buying it 
some ppl are more critical than others some of us have been studying these phenomenon for years so of course a movie about feminism parting from barbieland its not gonna be enough as a critical commentary but maybe it will open the possibility to speak about this themes in a more profound way with ppl that arent as critical as us and the same goes to oppenheimer

 for a long time mattel has been pushing this narrative of feminism and inclusitivity to the barbie brand to cater to what the critics have said about barbie since her conception introducing new body types skin colours hair textures and disabilities etc while all of those things are great they got tunnel vision and forgot what made barbie the icon she is today the fashion the fun the glamour they even massively stepped away from the colour pink in their branding and went for more of a neutral approach but the use of pink here has been vital to its success and marketing as a result the barbie brand has suffered a lot because of it barbie is less of a fashion doll and more of an action figure these days that focuses exclusively on diversity inclusivity and careers fashion and glamour have entirely left the buildingthats the direction mattel decided to go in with the barbie brand for the last 10 years or so so i find it hard to believe they were behind this narrative when its the polar opposite of the narrative they push in the actual barbie toys we see on the shelves the movie dolls which are sold out are the polar opposite to the barbie dolls on shelves wearing jeans and a plain tshirt if they knew this would reinvigorate the barbie brand why would they wait for this if they dont capitolise on this movie and rebrand the actual barbie toys then the movie is entirely in vain to improve barbiemattels image",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6l9gEbFn-UMOMAVeOiSbSA,0.9501,positive,True

6057,@9045lalala,7/8/2023,21:54:16,1,"your video is wonderful the cynicism about barbie is completely understandable and i actually agree that the film has some very evident structural problems especially with the underdeveloped america ferrera character

two key things i would disagree with however are

a im not sure if theres much of a point in criticizing gerwig for wanting and not needing to make bigbudget films sure by doing so shes feeding into a pretty corrupt industry but at the scale she was already operating i just dont think there is any possible way you cannot feed it i mean until just one of these days this industry centered on midbudget fare with possible oscar potential like little women was run by none other than harvey weinstein all the corrupt amptp streaming services are involved in that same midbudget industry as well just last year baumbach made a movie released by netflix the system just sucks inherently

so it seems unfair to direct resentment at her for making the films she wants to make its quite likely that she simply doesnt want to be nicole holofcener she wants to be steven spielberg and thats okay and obviously i dont mean this as a slight to holofcener at all i just mean in terms of scale

b i think sometimes subtlety is overvalued when it comes to messaging in films especially in cynical film criticism circles like ours where honesty and sentimentality are so often seen as things to be rebuked

i mean where is the line that separates a film spoonfeeding its message to the audience and a film simply being sincere direct and straighttothepoint about the issues it wants to talk about

one of the things i actually admire about barbie is that directness 

i think given the constraints of the material and the context it was made in we mostly had two options here

1 a film that was simply fun and pink which did not mention the capitalist angle of the doll at all but still dealt with barbies cultural legacy in very subtle tangential winkwink iykyk ways and of course feminism

ultimately the goal of this movie would simply be to sell dolls

2 the one we have here which does address headon the myriad of issues that have circled this doll over the years in very very unambiguous terms her role in issues of gender in the context of capitalism and the existential gap between the perfect barbie utopia and the cold hard truths of reality

there is a certain satirical bite to it but not too much in the end you want audiences to have a really fun time because here too the ultimate goal of the movie is simply to sell dolls

that is the one thing about a barbie movie you just cannot escape mattel wants to sell barbies

and well within that framework i would pick film 2 any day of the week

ps i too would love to watch films without having to think of the ulterior motives behind them but that just seems like a completely inescapable reality there are ulterior motives behind oppenheimer as well for instance universal part of amptp is backing it and im absolutely sure that the one thing they could think about when they heard nolan biopic and wwii was that sweet sweet oscar gold

but artists can make great works of art in spite of all these ulterior motives and that should be recognized something like across the spiderverse for instance obviously has very obvious corporate interests behind it its a wonderful way for this marvel product to be recontextualized as hip creative diverse etc and ultimately for them to sell toys comics merch and whatnot

but well the film is still wonderful",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgsnnr5jhvRS3-SEniQFEcg,0.9977,positive,True

ps ive also enjoyed movies from the bcu especially the rapunzel one

pps another thing worth considering given that barbie is a international icon is that it is largely an urban phenomenon so the audience response to the movie can vary based on the area some of the messages the movie is trying to sell might fall utterly flat",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwfL3crOMRIuc6Vq3-ENIMQ,0.6956,positive,True

they were too shallow and simplified to actually speak to them in any way it felt shoved in due to expectation and unnecessary to the general story this specific film was telling

if you think about it the reason the film even needed america ferrera to monologue all the themes in a heavy handed manner is because the film itself really isnt about those things or didnt do a good job showing it by the story itself

in my opinion for what its worth it was a film about an estranged mother daughter relationship unrequited love and maybe what it means to be human in a basic way

and then the social commentary was thrown in due to expectation bc of barbies place in the cultural discussion but not built into the foundation of the film 

otherwise it could almost seem harmful to portray the patriarchy as hapless idiots who just need girl bosses to tell them whats right as opposed to the complex and more insidious concept that it is

and ironically i think the film inadvertently tackles the idea of traditional masculinity and men feeling forced into it in a more detailed way than it portrays female identity boiling it down to the stereotypical attributes like just being pretty motherhood etc

i think its ok to expect some level of complexity if it decides to tackle a subject it doesnt need to be the most brilliant take but its ok to want it not to be shallow and kind of sanitize a real issue

on the other hand if this film spoke to young girls or adult women in a meaningful way who am i to judge

also this wasnt a film for kids bc most of the topics it did broach seem to be about issues adults deal with not kids and a lot of adult humor so people using that excuse are just actively ignoring the movie itself",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuO9qkbCNARFtH-YecgOQw,0.9816,positive,True

thats why i cant be too cynical about the huge marketing campaign i love that girly things are trendy right now because when i was a kidteenager i got basically bullied out of every pink and girly thing i had but of course we should be cynical about mattel and capitalism
that being said the movie just isnt that good the best thing about it was ironically the ken stuff it shouldve been a musical with only the storyline of kens trying to establish a patriarchy all the other stuff that mother daughter conflict solved off screen and other cheap references were just too much it would have made more sense to touch up on other feminist topics in potential sequels the ending was also very frustrating because nothing about the real world seemed appealing there wasnt one scene where barbie was like oh maybe the real world is actually better so the ending came out of nowhere but all in all im very glad that movie exists which i cant tell about any of the disney remakes or netflix adaptations in the recent years",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0m_zgK3WsWJ0sHt7KNwkKw,0.9574,positive,True

i cant help but feel really sad about that its hard for me to fully articulate why but i think part of it is because im not sure if the barbie movie aware of this relationship which i think is particularly prevalent with women of colour and that is an important facet of barbie yes i know that the kid basically tells all of this to barbies face but were not meant to agree with her the audience is meant to think silly girl doesnt she know thats not what barbie is you just dont get hernot you knowmaybe she has a point maybe barbie has made various women feel bad about themselvesthe fact that barbie being a figure used to harm some women is a prevalent part of barbies history and to ignore that aspect of her history feels dishonest at least to me

i really liked the barbie movie i had so so much fun and also its fair to be critical the problem is that a lot of the criticism is fueled by conservative chauvinism rather than being with the movie just a few days ago i was having a conversation with gen x white gay man who was complaining that he didnt like barbie because america giving the speech about women was hypocritical because she lost weight to get more roles ironically even though the message was being spoon fed to him that no matter what any woman does shes still going to be criticized did go straight over his head and again this is a liberal democrat so its one of those things where everything youre saying is correct and also so much of the criticism in general is weighted by misogyny and this is girlie so thing is bad rhetoric that thats where i think the preemptive backlash you received came from its exhausting that weve had the first blockbuster movie in years that is unapologetically for women and its being this hated why are we hearing more criticism about barbie when it is literally in opposition to oppenheimer which was more of the same old lets yet again tell a story about a white straight man who is a misunderstood genius is shitty to women but narratively the women will be framed as kind of deserving it for various reasons harms people but hes the sympathetic party in the story dude killed hundreds of thousands and christoper nolan decided to tell his story rather than that of japanese people forced into camps in america which is on brand for nolan to be fair  but yes lets go off on barbie

unfortunately i do agree with everything you said here however i do separate the film from the conditions and i thought it was an excellent movie

i put this genre on a scale from lego to mario to emoji the emoji movie was one of the worst of all time the mario movie was only fun because i played a lot of mario the lego movie had something to say all of them are corporate commercials in addition to being films

i felt the barbie movie landed firmly on the lego movie side i didnt think it was just fun i thought the in your face messaging was itself commentary on neoliberalism nothing in the movie was realistic and nothing in it should be taken at face value i see it all as the fantasy as imagined by america ferreras character

her own corporate overlords are just as fake as the plastic product they pump into the world her daughter delivered her own opinion of the real meaning behind the corporate schlock even though she is not immune from loving the nostalgic product from her youth despite acknowledging its flaws venic beach is somewhat realistic but with exaggerated levels of sexism that would be how it would actually be perceived by someone who has experienced that at times she imagines being able to solve the patriarchy by yelling her opinions at people until they change their mind and then getting them all to vote and it completely works and all the problems are solved

right in the very beginning the barbieland supreme court is overturning citizens united thats one of the first things that happens in the film

it is absolutely hampered by the fact that it is corporate approved and designed to sell toys but within that unfortunate constraint i thought gerwig did a fantastic job

i also think that media is grossly oversaturated with romantic love as a whole where is that promotion of healthy loving friendships same sex and hetero love between siblings between children and their parents whenever two characters are remotely attached and friendly to each other everyones always going crazy about shipping and i think thats really sad romance is not the peak of a relationship friendships are just as valuable and can give just as much and i feel like thats often neglected in favor of making things romanticsexual i dont know why everyone seems so obsessed with this",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzOp681QbRp3XZTpwjPfihw,0.9801,positive,True

when i got my first barbie dvd it was for christmas and right now i cant remember the age i was but i was still in primary school i actually hated it and the fact that it was so girly xd and then i watched it and noticed that yeah its girly but its still a story about overcoming yourself and being supported by friends thats what all barbie movies are about the power of friendship but yeah theyre pretty gay too d
im very happy with the things you said the barbie movies keep discorses of gender and sexuality open for the gays but at the same time naturalizing heterosexuality and feminine gender roles for the straights i always used to ship barbie with ken or the male love interest of the movie but there were exceptions its funny because in diamond castle i liked the twin wearing white but i disliked the twin wearing orange  sometimes some male love interests just werent worthy of barbies love
even though i didnt see the gay when i was a child or a teenager as an adult i see it 100 what i see more though is the friendship that is in all of these movies we all know that homosexuality and friendship doesnt rule each other out but since the movies connect me to my best friend its just what i focus on 
if anyone is still here reading this i want to point out something in germany we get everything dubbed so i know these movies by heart in german listening to 2742 was really funny because the german dub here says such mir meinen mann selbst aus which translates to choose my husband myself  one way to make it straight mattel deutschland

i always joked about being bisexual but after breaking away from a longterm abusive relationship when it was time to move on i tried to imagine the person i wanted to have around me and finally took it seriously that this person could be a woman i am very glad that i stopped joking although my parents never embarrassed me for such jokes i still felt some pressure from the world that i should not be like that as soon as i told my parents that i was bisexual seriously i was supported and my mother only advised me to change the tinder settings so as not to miss my chance among women
as for barbie movies  i thought that when i grow up i realize that they are stupid and for children but it turned out the opposite each review gives me something new and i want to show these movies to my children if i have them unlike disney cartoons which were boxed stories stories about a princess who wants more and a prince whose names are not even mentioned in half of the movies barbie cartoons did not fit in the box through them i fell in love with ballet got visual orgasms from brilliant transformations and learned wonderful songs but i also got a bunch of protagonists who save themselves and the world stories in which love is not at the center of the plot evidence that being a woman is difficult but we should fight for justice and the representation of many kinds of relationships from love and friendship to relationships between brothers sisters parents and children and more its more than disney with a standard love a standard antagonist who interferes with love and a standard kiss that can fix everything

patriarchy is a paradigm where the male force dominates the feminine force
this paradigm is toxic a move away from seeing  emotions and the bodys and earth as sacred
we need to return to a paradigm where the feminine force governs the masculine force therefore the male force is not dominating but respecting the feminine the feminine guides the masculine with her wisdom which has greater moral compass the whole of our world is in a toxic paradigm this is now dying

the movie starts with the kens being basically just a distraction while barbie is the center of it all ken is depicted as childish simpleminded and stupid

due to the extreme feminism ken feels excluded from barbieland and so discovered the masculinity in the real world

once he goes back into barbieland he usurps the position of the higher ups together with an army of ken and ends up forming a government of only men oppressing the barbies as a consequence

once the barbies get their positions in society back they realize the kens were also hurt with their extreme feminism so the movie ends with both sides of the coin being acknowledged as bad and so barbie tries to form a society in which the barbies and kens should have the same influence its said in the end of the movie that with the changes the government made ken would eventually be as important as barbie

abstract i give 2023s barbie a 4510 its honestly lazy storytelling incredibly divisive and completely unnecessary disneys 2000 lifesizedirected by mark rosman and featuring tyra banks and lindsey lohan does a significantly better job at being a barbie movie and portraying the dei and the positively empowering elements of the official barbie brand however given the movies apparent tones of misandry it was specifically made for neofeministic modern adult women who hate men and the patriarchy which was mentioned 10x in the film while there are actually some genuinely amusing and funny elements in the 114minute film that would appease adhd individuals stoners and people who simply enjoy corny or bad content the simple objective truth is that its just not a good movie

the full version apparently people often forgot this as theyre difficult concepts to grasp and remember

1 so bad its good so bad its goodis a real and true adjective it means that something can be so god awful and dire that it actually becomes amusing and entertaining to seehear about dont get it wrong its still objectively bad but there are a large group of people who enjoy objectively bad things and get a kick out of it and thats okay however that doesnt make it good or successful 

2 advertising plugs and political messages if you didnt know companies andor politicians place advertising plugs and political messages into entertainment as a way for those companies andor politicians to curry favor with their customersconstituents and to entice those customersconstituents to buy their productsthink like they do sometimes these advertisementsmessages are covert or subliminal that often go unnoticed however nowadays theyre often completely overt advertisingmessaging that are crass and inyourface all in all its a highly profitable business one that has existed and been inplace in the usa for at least the last 100 years the best ones are the ones that influence and manipulate you without you being aware of it

3 rated e  for everyone author note oh man i can already hear the feint sounds of hordes of women screaming out it wasnt made for youwith salty tears running down their faces regardless of whom a companies content was originally intended for and aimed at anyone and everyone can watchbuypartake in that content if theres one thing businesses know its that to make money and rake in the largest profits they can from a particular project it needs to be as open accessible and available to as large a group as possible why because you simply dont make enough money pandering to a small specific group of people not nearly enough and in regarding to any movies marketed primarily towards children companies already know that its the childrens parents adults who will be the ones paying for and taking their children to see that content and buying all the merch for them well guess who also expect to be entertained thats right the parents who are adults thats precisely why childrens movies have subtle adult oneliners gags and notsosubtle imagery thrown in that only an adult would be able to comprehend and understand

2023s barbie movie directed by greta gerwig and starring margot robbie and ryan gosling relates to all of the points above mattels barbiefashion doll brand is a massive generational ip intellectual property everyone in the world has heard of barbie and probably at one point or another has owned a barbie or ken doll like the walt disney company nintendo company etc anything these companies produce or come out with will be considered an automatic guaranteed success even if it is an objectively and genuinely flawedbad product that doesnt sell and ends up loosing the company money thats simply one of the many benefits of being such a large and wellknown company now regarding the 2023 barbie movie sure its an amusing movie with lost of scenes and musical numbers that would make any adhd person or stoned individual happy and margot robbie does an amazing job portraying a barbielikecharacter however the movie forcefully creates drama and conflict when there wasnt a need in the first place ergo the matriarchalpatriarchal divide of the barbies and the kens that while one group is in the lightand gets to enjoy life the other group must be in the darkand must suffer culminating in an allout female vs male war for dominancy speaking of suffering this movie suffers greatly from being rife with blatant modern neofeministic political messaging dont believe me the word patriarchywas actually used a total of ten 10 separate times throughout the movies 114minute runtime all the barbiesin the movie are propped up coddled empowered strong intelligent capable kind and any other positive attribute you can think of women while all the kensare knocked down weak dumb incapable rude and any other negative attribute you can think of men in fact all of barbies woes in this movie stem from both 1 gloria america ferrera and 2 ken ryan gosling the movie portrays that barbie is not only being twisted by the dark thoughts of gloria in trying to and failing to connect with her daughter so she revisits her comfort toy barbie but it also portrays that barbie is being held back and sabotaged by ken who is just looking to fit in and feel valued appreciated and loved like barbie is otherwise barbie would be perfectly flawless in every single way and could ascend to goddesshood so in this way 2023s barbie attempts to portray ken and the kensas the villains when in reality theyre just average men 2023s barbie also doesnt stick to the original barbie formula barbie being the ideal perfect woman and ken being the ideal perfect man who are the ideal perfect match for each other and who are equals partners 2023s barbie also gets barbies generational personality characteristics and beliefs wrong that she was well known for in this way disneys 2000 lifesizedirected by mark rosman and starring lindsay lohan and tyra banks was a far superior and more accurate portrayal of the barbie brand barbies personality and beliefs and barbies life its actually such a difference that people are now beginning to question if greta gerwig intentionally directed 2023s barbie movie to be a satirical take at barbie and specifically poke fun at todays modern women",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCat8P0KRKg2vgmqz0Td97Bg,0.9988,positive,True

so womens sex equality is  to sexist against men so womens equality can never exist in that frame nice move guys like were that dumb womens equality and womens liberation specifically is not harmful in any shred shape context or universe 
barbie was invented firstly because girls most girls enjoy playing with dolls 
and it was a sexist representation in the beginning as everything was barbie was tiny and petite and perfectly made up and a trophy wife and a beach bum until the idea to start inspiring girls to do whatever they want and shoot for the stars began probably in the 1970s and on 

its barbie world its fake men its not the real world barbie world is the one world that isnt centered on men and it doesnt have to be piers is a joke if he actually believes this im hoping hes just being a good boy reading the script other times he seems relatively smart he seems to get awfully close at times to saying dangerously feminist things like women should be able to make their own boundaries and have their own spaces sports and prisons and that its wrong for men to come in and demand inclusion whenever wherever they want it just because they want it and for no other reason he seems to acknowledge that despite getting into trouble for it course he was kicked off shortly when he made those statements so maybe hes just falling in line with this dipsht take 

by the way piers if women can make their own boundaries and have their own spaces doesnt this also constitute that and men helped to write and produce it its just a fantasy world where women run the show ya weak little misogynists cant even handle a fantasy world where women are the center of attention 

and what is it with men and anti reality weve seen so many iterations of it we live in a world and a current timeline where your grandmothers and great grandmothers were born without rights a world where your mothers and grandmothers were born to a time and a society where women still couldnt have their own bank accounts 70s why are yall acting like this is not the reality men have always had these rights women are still fighting for our most basic fvcking human rights yet youd rather live in lala land because it offends you to acknowledge that women have been chattel until the most recent century that women had no human rights the world over  and still dont in a huge majority of the world and even in the allegedly most progressive nations were fighting for those basic rights all over again well it should offend you but not in the way that it typically does",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2WYnJPlBPoRcaZg2eQljg,0.4623,positive,True

ever heard of misandry
misandry is formed from the greek misos  hatred and anr andros  gen  man 21  it means hating man and everything men stand for i guess this film shows this in buckets and spades from the start to the finish 

from the outset the movie feels like a trojan horse disguising its heavyhanded agenda of perceived male hatred and an obsession with dismantling the patriarchy the supposed empowerment narrative turns out to be a thinly veiled manbashing exercise that trades humor for misguided messages about sexism and patriarchy even the barbieken romance is undermined perpetuating a narrative that emasculates male characters rather than promoting healthy equal relationships

as the plot unfolds the movie takes an unexpected turn with barbies struggle with menopause a topic that feels disconnected and adds to the films lack of coherence the portrayal of ken as a deranged antagonist and the subsequent attempt to establish a matriarchal society in barbie land further detract from the movies credibility

the films failure to balance entertainment with meaningful storytelling exposes larger issues within hollywood as it appears more focused on pushing biased feminist agendas than fostering creativity and joy the movies divisive and biased messages are harmful doing a disservice not only to young girls and women but also to men and families

in conclusion i cannot recommend barbie to anyone seeking an enjoyable and meaningful cinematic experience the films promotion of the fifth wave of feminism seems to have lost sight of what true empowerment means for both women and men it is a shame that such potential for a masterpiece was squandered by the directors agendadriven approach highlighting the broken state of hollywood today this film could have been great but it ultimately falls flat echoing the problematic trends seen in some disney films as well

also people were like this movie addresses too many subjects and topics at once  just to clarify when in their own real life does life throw at you a single issue like monday  gender issues tuesday immigration issues wednesday  human rights issues thursday  world poverty index and its issues friday  political issues   does it happen like that do people live in a world structured like that when issues fall on u as per your convenience or do u live in a world surrounded by multitudes of it at the same time like how does it even make sense to point that in the movie as something not on the positive side thats just very normal to put it like that cz one cannot not look how most general life issues are not interconnected

that last point of that teen girl behaving that way and her mother as well since she harbors the idea of why is barbie so perfect n why is my life n my cellulite n my waist nt perfect hdnce let me get our lives intertwined i mean yeah people like that exist n have a messed up idea of how thing ought n ought nt to be the whole idea over being good enough  comes from this n it was addressed thank you",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8a9i91EVT3SLrbXp4Wb8Jg,0.9866,positive,True

to be clear about just how important it is that this particular story be created from a female perspective and how necessary it is for more female directors screenwriters and producers to be telling more and more and more stories in the entertainment media churned out by hollywood please consider this 

when little women was released in 2019 it swept the awards circuit winning numerous golden globes and other industry awards for direction acting screenplay and costuming until the pinnacle of them all the academy awards it was nominated in almost all major categories  saoirse ronan for best actress florence pugh for best supporting actress greta gerwig for best adapted screenplay best costume design and many many others the one notable award for which it was not nominated was best director for gerwig this is important because she was among a significant number of female directors that year who put out critically acclaimed or commercially successful movies and not a single one of them was nominated for the best director oscar films like portrait of a lady on fire book smart hustlers among others were snubbed by the academy and to such an egregious extent that natalie portman wore a custom made gown with the last names of these female directors embroidered on the dress as an act of silent petition and expression of her dissatisfaction

whichdoesnt mean you dont have a point somewhere under all that vitriol

there is a significant issue with the approach proactivist feminism takes  on the whole as represented by this film not calling anyone reading this out i dont know you and if i do there are literally only two people i do know personally who i have a problem with and they know it  in that it is perhaps understandably given socially imposed gender roles placed upon gods creation very angry and seeks to aggressively convince men and women of the correctness of their cause without offering alternatives that are rooted in what men need or want it may be that it cannot offer this  i dont know our society in the west has lost so much of what it genuinely means to be male replacing it with a false viewpoint generated by historical social powers

barbie represents this in a microcosm  it speaks very well to most women although many are critical of one aspect of another i think your wife could benefit from speaking to mine as she appears not to have had her views politely challenged by a member of her gendersex hot topic button  however the film lectures to men and either you already agree with the thesis or it is inclined to make you switch off or get angry

but man hatingwhatprecisely is that you dont explain for all your ranting

i understand you believe in stereotypical historical victorian social roles but your vitriolic opinion borders frankly on one that is offensive to many

given how much you appear to wish to be accepted by others as part of the mainstream  particularly recently  and to have your opinions which i should point out i regard several you have espoused in this long rant i didnt get to the end as directly damaging to my wife her life and her future  and frankly your kids im old enough and bold enough to challenge another man on how he raises his kids  accepted as acceptable points of view to argue overby others and not to be attacked so why attack them worst of all why do you put forward opinions that literally decry people i know as morally wrong

because you seek to save their souls you are  as i am now aware  cotlds after all i share your worry while i doubt the existence of heaven i am less doubtful of the existence of god and of the opinion its best to hedge your bets towards living well but i cannot square a liberal live and let liveworld as taught to many through many windows into the divine with literally harmful words being spoken about people i care about by you  and most of all i still cannot believe the person who seeks to have their opinions shared by all and not to bring politics or religioninto a subject could have such strong beliefs

i will not make the mistake and think you dont have the mental capabilities to understand basic facts like how women were oppressed throughout history or that there were certain advancements in womens rights and equality in the last century or so but then you take these two facts and in the most ingenuine and dare i say sinister way you make the conclusion all is well now women can vote get a job its time to go back to making babies because you know for a fact as a man that brings joy to most women this notion is one of the main issues still this is what people like you my parents or grandparents passed down or are passing down indoctrinating children some people are not woke they are doing their best and what they think is best is passing down this wisdom which is really just an outdated ideology to their children it is still damaging but at least not evil on the other hand shad you are very much woke you are aware that people were or are being oppressed but you still dont want to change a single thing about it as the system benefits you you are not the one being told to go and put your body through a whole ordeal of producing another human being are you i refuse to believe that as an educated man living in the year 2023 you are aware of the expectations society has for women how damaging they are and that they are set by a system ruled by men whether you like it i think you actually do or not cultural political and economic power is still held primarily by men look up the statistics if you dont believe it and i appreciate you talking about the expectations injustices and violence towards men in such a society it is an important discussion as well but i beg you to look at the bigger picture and understand this is caused by the same system still this system disproportionately hurts women it was not created by feminists it was not created by women it was the men who came before us and it is damaging and unethical if we the men of today dont do anything to deconstruct it and you dont have to do much just listen to others and step aside when it is clearly not your time to intervene 

i know you are into history it is obvious if someone followed you in the past but even by just looking at the set it is not hard to understand that in the context of history change is a continuous progress and economic cultural technological and political factors all contribute to it we are at the beginning of a journey where some political tools were already used to give voice to people who were oppressed which will lead to even more changes and i hope it will result in true equality in all the aforementioned regards but this takes time and we need platforms for discussion one such platform was the movie barbie just as you didnt have the opportunity to go over all the propaganda lines you mentioned i wont be able to address all the problematic comments you made but let me give it a try

this movie is not hating on men it expresses resentment of a society that disproportionately favors one gender over the other and sets unrealistic expectations which it enforces through violence shame taboos and objectification if you belong to one gender its like playing the game on easy mode sure there are challenges but you have more resources to overcome them and you face less adversity where one gender is treated like a baby machine and if they dont conform to certain expectations associated with such a role they will be treated as disruptive elements to society and they will be ridiculed shamed and get the stigma of mental illness on the other hand if you are born as the other gender you will have the opportunity to pursue whatever lifegoal you would like no questions asked whether you like it or not our society is this way it favors men and we should call it patriarchy because it is

i feel genuinely sorry for both of you for missing out on how fun this movie actually was all i hear is that you complain about the propaganda when you had the opportunity to just sit there and even if you dont agree with the messages just have a laugh and a good time you complained that barbie set out on her quest because of such trivial reasons even if you dont comprehend that this whole movie is a journey from being a massproduced but perfect commodity to becoming a real human being with imperfections and finite existence the banality of the whole situation is still just funny or how comical the whole storyline with mattel is and how they just start selling the ken toys when they realize they can make money off of those and i couldnt help but tear up how this certain kind of masculinity was portrayed by the kens living their macho lives in their mojo dojo casa houses you even bring up when the movie reflects on itself as margot robbie being the wrong actress for conveying the message that is a joke whats your issue with it you are just blinded by your hatred for everything this movie represents and would rather devalue everything about it and not risk taking it at face value and questioning your own worldview and actions

and the comment you made about the male ego when they wouldnt take the vote as the kens were too caught up in their own conflict literally the next video on the channel is about the movie where the male protagonists build a weapon of mass destruction out of hubris instead of spending half of the video debating for some strange reason if this is communist propaganda  the two other dudes could have talked about this please show me a piece of mainstream media where the actions of the female protagonist threaten to destroy the whole world and she still goes through with it without having a good reason do you know why men are represented this way because we had and still have the privilege to make inconsiderate and dangerous decisions to boost our own ego and we can get away with it it was a very smart and elegant solution that barbie implemented to resolve the conflict

im not sure how you could miss the point about gender equality after the barbies take back control over barbie land the kens got exactly what women in the real world get nowadays if you are upset about the inequality of this you should be but please show the same level of being upset when it comes to the rights of women


one last point i want to make is that you are so fixated on how this movie portrays women how it will affect them and how the message resonates with them women dont need you or me or any other men to speak up for them they can do it on their own why dont you reflect on what this movie can give to you and teach you there are tons of injustices against women that im sure you can see but instead of playing the good guy and saying not all men or i never identified with some particular problematic behavior understand how your actions shape the world around you and how they perpetuate harmful dynamics systems and attitudes when i was younger and saw a few videos of you i understood you were a smart guy and as i said im sure you are aware of many of the inequalities but you choose to remain ignorant as it is easier to rant on the internet for publicity and the peace of mind that you are just enough the way you are and there is nothing that you need to do this behavior is harmful and evil but im not saying you are an evil person just own up to your baggage like everyone else should go to therapy ask for the forgiveness of people you hurt whatever works for you you are kenough just own who you are and try to do better instead of spewing this altright propaganda on the internet

art is subjective and i guess you read it as antiman and i didnt youre not wrong and im not right i suppose we just have different lived experiences and care about different things in my lived experience i know the patriarchy is restrictive and negatively impacts everyone women are oppressed under it and men are repressed under it i dont know you personally but you seem to use the words patriarchyand maninterchangeably as though men are the patriarchy this seems to be where your criticism lies and perhaps reevaluating what the patriarchy actually means may change your thoughts about feminism who knows just a thought

13503,@m.r.6760,6/8/2023,14:54:29,1,"personally i think the film had good intentions but it is very badly written

the message of how in patriarchy and matriarchy everyone suffers in a certain way and that you have to have empathy is a good one and i think the film tries to leave a message of reconciliation at the end but it is poorly executed

on the one hand barbieland is a simple and quaint matriarchy the kens are just for show while the real world is a cartoonish patriarchy when it suits the film and not when it doesnt if the real world were more cartoonish it would be a cartoonish patriarchy
if the real world were more cartoonish id understand it better but theres 4th wave feminism women have normal jobs a doctor makes fun of ken and tells him that because hes a man he wont get everything in the real world so is it comparable that barbie gets her ass touched by a random and only has male ceos in matel to the kens not having houses if they dont live with their respective barbies or that ken feels loved because they ask him the time plus lets face it in the real world if someone met a man who looked like ryan they would look at his ass and abs male or female i would its funny that a movie with a trans barbie and references to transsexuality doesnt make references to homosexuals or how men often look at each others asses

thats why at the end when the narrator says that kens in the future will be equal to barbies when in the real world women will be equal to men it doesnt sit well because one shouldnt excuse ones injustices in the mistakes of others why should you respect heterosexuals i will respect them when they let me get married in japan it doesnt correlate with reality which is much more complex anyone who knows anything about history would tell you that there were thousands of important women in history in patriarchal societies while in barbieland there is not a single important ken which could have been solved in the end ken the doll actually has several jobs like astronaut or singer

the other problem of this conflict is how it is solved with a speech of the mother its nice the message that nobody is perfect and you will never please everybody but what does it have to do in the matriarchy of the early days of barbies women discriminated against each other because of the way they looked and the way they were with the pregnant and the weird barbie that message doesnt solve the patriarchy or anything because the kens also suffer from the same problems both when it was oppressive and when it wasnt the kens needing the approval of their barbies the kens never created distrust between the barbies to take power they were always with each other the whole fighting fire with fire thing makes no sense ken literally says he convinced everyone to set up a patriarchy with arguments hence the books he took with him barbie just threw out an unrelated speech and appealed to cheap sentimentality i could even be ironic and say that because it had to appeal to sentimentality and manipulation the movie is telling me that the best system of government and society is patriarchy even if its under morons like the kens

pd if the film is trying to sell me as patriarchal for a man to talk to a woman about a movie he likes or show her something especially when she asked in the first place its ridiculous to be serenaded a lot of women would love that its cute

thats why honestly ken is the most sympathetic character barbie wants to be human at the end for reasons even though she didnt live in the real world for more than a few hours the scene made me cry by itself but there is no consistent character development to get there ken does have better development and as he is much funnier he is much more enjoyable even the message that you should seek your own identity comes across much better with ken because neither the real world nor the ceos take ken seriously

the same happens with the mother and the daughter there is a whole relationship conflict that is never developed it is resolved out of nowhere the daughter who at the beginning i could understand her speech as a stereotype of a girl who hates barbies but despite her development keeps throwing phrases about white savior and cultural appropriation i am a latin woman living in latin america if its a joke its not funny

i understand that ceos are a joke about how businessmen only like money but god its commentary when he defends why theyre all men whats wrong with men working in industries focused on girls a man cant like barbie even as a concept in their quest to talk about the oppression of women they ended up getting carried away with gender stereotypes shhhh

a and the opening scene in itself gave me a chuckle but coupled with the scenes about the pregnant friend being weird so be whatever you want to be minus mum possibly not the intention but it can read like that

so while i enjoyed the creativity of the film i appreciated some of the jokes and how they translated barbies world into the real world the film ends up creating a sort of unintentional double standard i think its because it doesnt quite balance when to take itself seriously and when not to",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZDPGHiYwZhvtmHzoj-EWCw,0.9971,positive,True

at no point are womens own limits or mistakes or fails or the womens movements failure areas  and lack of needed cultural fixes and integration  clearly acknowledged or addressed

what they did hit right was barbies role in giving something to shoot for beyond wife or motherhood the babydoll massacre was wellintended but missed the mark badly and they disparaged the kens and all men so much id actually suggest its not a good film for men or boys because of the level of misandric blameshifting and hate and pathological dishonesty about the status quo

the fullspectrum bipoc united colors of benetton range of barbies and kens was really nice though the gayness of some kens needed to be shown better and morbidly obese mouthy phatgirl barbie misfired wheelchair barbie is on for 2 seconds kate mckinnons barbie was frosk  and a poorly alluded to lesbian barbie and alan was the lone officio gay

considering its an amusing yet overly simpletonned sic  pathologically dishonest misandrically sexist and enlightened intersectional feminist planecrash and crapfest im sure much of the male criticism was fair and correct in terms of rainbowliciousness and bipoc inclusive united colors of benetton certified it works beautifully and it also works well when making fun of itself making some good sharp social commentary and pointingout that barbie gave women something more to consider and aspire to other than wife mother or sex object whilst still allowing for them as partial identities

where it fails is that where feminism failed where culture still needs coordinated structural and operational overhaul and where womens own failings  weaknesses and areas of less than stellar trackrecord are part of the problem are cognitive distortion delusional ignored bypassed and paved over

what could have been a tremendously uplifting educational and connective egalitarian humanist lol moment for both genders in binary  and those biopsychologically gendered beyond  instead fails in many ways the part that really worked against them was the baby doll massacre all they needed to do to ace it was set the babies aside with one of them who enjoyed the role whilst others spreadout exploring new options and then circlingup to discussed

first of all the movies central message revolves around embracing individuality and breaking free from stereotypes barbies character exemplifies a strong confident and independent personality not to demean or belittle men but to inspire everyone regardless of gender to be true to themselves and pursue their dreams fearlessly

the movie showcases positive male characters too ken for instance is portrayed as a supportive and respectful partner to barbie encouraging her and helping her achieve her goals this demonstrates that healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and encouragement irrespective of gender roles

furthermore the film subtly addresses the importance of gender equality and inclusivity it shows that everyone has unique talents and abilities and these qualities arent defined by ones gender by promoting diversity and representation the barbie movie sends a powerful message that theres strength in embracing and celebrating our differences

the movie doesnt bash men instead it promotes the idea that both boys and girls can be strong kind and compassionate highlighting the importance of cooperation and teamwork in solving problems this lesson is essential for all young viewers as it encourages them to see each other as equals and work together harmoniously

lets remember that entertainment aimed at empowering girls doesnt mean demeaning boys the barbie movie serves as an inclusive and positive platform reminding us that we can all learn from one another and grow together as a society

so before passing judgment on the movie id recommend giving it a chance and watching it with an open mind you might discover the hidden beauty and valuable life lessons it offers which benefit not just one gender but all of us as human beings lets celebrate positivity and understanding in the media and support films that promote unity and empowerment ",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbAEqB4XnSPs2M1QOEzhnEg,0.9994,positive,True

1430 its less about actual legal rights and more about getting the years of brainwashing from the patriarchy out and help actually equalize the playing field this btw helps both men and women in that it tries to for example normalize showing emotion for men and be more open with their struggles and its also removing that mindset of women as mostly jut objects of desire both out of mens and womens brains stuff like that and patriarchy can take many forms often in ways we dont initally realize bc it has been so deeply internalized

having an unfair power balance sucks for everyone for men patriarchy forces you to be hostile and competitive it forces you to worry about whether youre being perceived as manly enough all the time it forces all of existence into a zero sum game where every man is competition and every woman is a prize to collect to show that you are winning the competition and thats no way to view the universe with all its infinite possibilities here on earth and beyond in short patriarchy is stupid and doesnt make a lot of sense as humanity moves into the future

this movie addresses that when the kens go wholehog on patriarchy their world dissolves into chaos because they ultimately discover that it isnt making them any happier or any closer to their true identities which it should be noted they lack under the matriarchy because a matriarchy would also be bad as again there would be an unequal power dynamic none of that is man hating being a man isnt a bad thing living in a world where men have more power is a bad thing",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaGPFjIaR9978OY2Z60XWvA,-0.9778,negative,True

you have used many buzzwords about this movie and its message that i feel are disingenuous because you seem to be offended that this media is trying to paint men as nothing but evil sexist pigs which it isnt it just doesnt shy away from the fact that a lot of women have to deal with some pretty horrendous stuff in their life they just condense it to make a point

and the part about the insecurities sure women do that to other women but that whole scene felt like a commentary as society as a whole and if you think men dont do things to make women feel insecure about themselves either on purpose or because of cultural norms then i dont really know what to say

im must admit i seem to be rambling but i guess the takeaway is i think youve created an opinion on the movie not based on its merits but based on surface level analysis based on the many buzzwords youve used in this first 10 minutes decided early on it was anti men then refused to do any deeper thought on it if something 40 more minutes into this video proves me wrong then so be it but i doubt it walking out of the movie neither me or my friend thought for one second the take away was that men are the enemy",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuHwHNSx3xbHvDMGXH7CvJA,0.8508,positive,True

patriarchy  men are bad
when women criticising other women there is no man actively taking part in that
no men  no bad men  no patriarchy
mysogyny no matter who it is displayed by  so also when its women against women  is deeply rooted in the patriarchal social system it affects both men and women however it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and expectations that can contribute to women preserving sexism against their own gender from childhood on people are socialized into gender roles girls are often taught that they should be submissive and prioritize the needs of others this can lead to competition and jealousy among women as they are raised to believe that they must compete for limited resources like attention affection or approval from men
also in patriarchal societies women have historically been limited in their access to education employment and positions of power this has created a scarcity mindset where women may feel they have to compete against each other for the few available opportunities rather than supporting each other to challenge the system that conserves these limitations to quote you but patriarchy is the enemy hell yes it is in fact i would argue that the patriarchy is the main reason for women being against othe women
when men hold the majority of power some women may feel that aligning with men or adopting patriarchal beliefs is a survival mechanism by distancing themselves from other women or displaying sexist attitudes they may believe it will make them more acceptable and gain favor within the dominant male power structures
you also argue that it is antimen and that society is unfair because it doesnt allow men to be emotional or sentimental well guess why that is the patriarchy just because its mostly women protesting against it it doesnt mean it cant negatively affect men as well men grow up in that same environment and learn that it is them who have to provide who have to be strong protective and are not allowed to show feelings they are not taught how to deal with emotions and therefore cling to the patriarchy even stronger so its recurrent its maybe the most fundamental reason why men feel attacked bei feminism because they fail to understand that it is about equality and not about women trying to attain power over men
overcoming internalized misogyny and breaking free from the patriarchal conditioning requires conscious awareness education and active efforts to build solidarity among women this movie is one small step among many to bring us closer to these goals mysogyny and inequality are serious problems in our society but this doesnt mean we cannot treat it with humor  or satire even to reach the broad society cinema holds immense power and not using it to convey a message as important as this one would be a shame to put it mildly
in times like these it would have been so much more problematic to create a movie that glorifies all the stereotypes and gender roles that barbie as a brand and with all its history fuels to have a critical contention about it is the best thing that could have happened i am also wondering how somebody could expect a movie made by greta gerwig to be a dull feel good chick flick

the movie is trying to put forward the notion that both men and women are of equal value because of who we are not because of what we do or dont do

the movie also warns against the excesses of feminism and matriarchy the catalyst for kens fall to the patriarchy was his oppression or devaluing at the hands of the barbies of barbieland their blatant hostility toward ken drove him straight into the arms of a misogynistic domineering oppressive ideology that was the mirror of the misrandistic dismissive repressive society he was subjected to",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUgdIyCgXWnWQw8BjzXkAzA,0.8496,positive,True

in the mid 1990s i was engaged to an ardent feminist  at the time i was ignorant enough to believe it was just about wanting men  women to be treated with equal value over time i found out it was not about that at all 

the feminist book that mattered most to her that she considered her bible said flatout that men are born abusive while women can never be abusive under any circumstances yet she was harsh and berating to anyone she felt did not give her her due including myself it got so bad that i eventually had to admit what should have been obvious from the start she herself was abusive

because i loved her i tried to show her the truth but of course i failed and she ended the relationship referring to me as the most abusive man ive ever known

a decade later in 2007 i finally met and married in 2008 a woman who seemed to not believe feminist propaganda at all however in 2014 as the culture war went public she has fallen for virtually every single piece of woke propaganda now the man she married  called her modern prophet jerimiah she now has called a sexist racist transphobe nazi because i refused to accept the cultural marxist lies 

for some reason she has not left me yet but i very much doubt love has anything to do with it as our marriage is little more than a hollowedout shell",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdyEMrGbm-34Zi67kUOcw1Q,-0.985,negative,True

i tracked american influence on middle eastern culture with three markerssunglasses ice water and barbie  the culture preached that sunshine made the eyes stronger  sipping room temperature water was good for the stomachand when the water temperature got hot dont drink  barbie was regarded as a slut and as antifamily  we crazy americans would pull shifts in excess of 48 hours at times without rest no matter how dark the night got or how hot the day was  the standard 12hour shift included naptime for my arab counterpartsand that was okay because i wasnt the boss  those counterparts smoothed the cultural differences between america and the middle east  my own arabic was never more than rudimentary  my spanish and german proved more useful and if i had spoken tagalog and cebuano or some fo the various indian languages i would have been golden  english was the second mostcommon language in the area  seeing better at night because uv hadnt wrecked my night vision impressed my coworkers  i was able to prove my vision using flashlights and the animals in the area  dehydration was combatted by overdrinking and ice water worked better than water that might be warmer than 40 graddehydration makes one sluggish  
as for barbie little girls in the middle east aspired to have professionsand families  when a father risked fines and worse to get a genuine barbie for his daughter that impressed me  the barbie invasion was so pervasive that now there are middle eastern knockoffs from china that come with traditional and modest middle eastern clothing

this is because men have one copy of two chromosomes an x and a y   while women have two copies of just one chromosome the y  so as far as genetic combinations go there are far more possible combinations in men compared to women

a bunch of women see that they dont have completely equal representation in powerful positions and a majority of them move on thinking that another woman will do it then the representation doesnt get to 50 and they get mad instead of realizing they had the opportunity but didnt why do they try to blame men for their shortcomings also radical feminists seem to think men dont have to face problems but men just face different problems than women for example just because a man seems happy and has everything he has dreamed for doesnt mean he didnt sacrifice a lot to get there the reason that people dont often see that struggle is because men dont often open up the same way women are criticized unfairly by other women on their cloths and appearance men are criticized unfairly on their emotions and their appearance as well this harsh reality really makes or breaks people

at least in the us and uk not sure about australia but if they were following the same rhetoric then they were probably the same many of the founders of feminism hated men even their own husbands and wrote about their ideal world through fiction that honestly reflect the barbie society in this movie very closely 

they were also huge supporters of eugenics seeing black women as inferior and in need of care and protection from the world and black men as no more then animals im not even joking their early writings were disturbing as all hell 

the current generation of feminists is not the exception but the desired direction of their founders

men or kens are banished

the fact that the barbies who had respected jobs such as a doctor etc were shown to be brainwashed into being maids was the perfect representation of how women are encouraged to be housewives instead of being independent and when they do become housewives they are then slapped in the face with terms such as gold digger dish washer stupid for not being able to find a real job",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKIilZnkqz6kkunngC2NOXA,0.8996,positive,True

     the reason ken was created was to have a male character in her life to compare her to and prove she can still be a strong female while a male is still around for instance ask the question how do you prove a female can still be a strong individual while in a relationship with a man without showing the man involved barbie and ken dolls can be used to do that now it is also up to the childs imagination so if they want to have barbie kicking kens butt because the young girl hates a male bully in school or how her older brother treats her at times thats one way she can show those feelings if they want doctor barbie to help a sick ken like in a medical romance drama they can do that if they want to pretend ken is in a military outfit is barbies father to reference their own parent in the military they can do that too its all in a childs mind childrens minds havent learned how most of the world works so their imagination and possibilities they could come up with are nigh endless its only limited by the fact they also need to use what information they do know as a basis to expand upon i agree we shouldnt have to bring up the feminism messaging aspect so if a girl doesnt like barbie thats perfectly fine that girls take shouldnt ruin barbie for all the others in a way thats what modern feminism has done to the movie it is promoting hating on guys to young girls as if thats going to make them want to be in a relationship or feel empowered these days i think modern feminists have a misunderstanding that says to be the bully tearing apart others is what makes them strong individuals when in reality bullies and show offs are usually doing such acts to compensate for how weak and powerless they truly feel",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_XKjW0gUGdaIGLxN5j-9BQ,0.9395,positive,True

they literally talked about everything except that the movie devalues men to such a degree its concerning for fathers of young daughters that want to see it dont say its not happening because ive been in more than one discussion with fathers of girls about it but ask about oppenheimer and feminists do nothing but complain the women werent shown being leaders in the science of the film well guess what it was the 1950s its based on real events and women werent heavily in those fields then but rather than come away from it with an appreciation for the progress that has been made they denigrate it for being true to the times tell me how 23 of college students are women yet we somehow still live in a patriarchy

why does feminism have to constantly feel the need to erase the value of men to show the value of women ken was literally the villain of the movie virtually the first words out of the womans mouth were women arent paid as much as men  where its literally illegal and has been for a long time feminists only seem to value the jobs women predominantly want to do they forget they need pipe fitters and linemen and roofers and sewage workers and many other hard dirty jobs that are almost entirely done by men yet literally keep our society running how quickly everyone forgets how things get when the garbage men go on strike

the one takeaway from the film i hear a lot about is that it is menvillainizing which it is not feminism is antipatriarchy not misandry gerwig simply shows how patriarchal the real world is and how toxic masculinity drives some men to feel the need to dominate each other for example ken feels he needs to change for barbie while becoming someone the other kens respect to rise above them in losing parts of himself for the sake of others ken loses the ability to have a sense of selfworth and love himself he believes hes nothing without barbie when she confronts him she explains that ken has to figure out who ken is without her by knowing that he knows his humanity which is the meaning behind im kenoughhe regains his selfworth by knowing who he is on his own best of all he stops suppressing his emotions breaking a toxic masculine trait im a liberated man i know crying is not weakmens mental health issues are not talked about enough which makes that message so important

 its the same old trick take your enemy copy what theyre doing and put your own version out rather than strawman your enemy to take them down you go one step further and pretend to be your enemy keeps your friends close and your enemies closer the tactic is so sun tzu that its almost poetry 

colonialism has been doing this since the ancient romans reapropriating and re interpreting the indigionous religions and cultures that it encounteredwith its colonial warmachine today we have neocolonialism and this is done through various forms of media culture rainbow sneakers lgbtq coffee mugs in coffee shops black lives matter t shirts 

movies with depth made abroad remade and hollowed out in america and replaced with a different philosophy nullifying the original concepts and ideas turned into other things historically look at the word anarchy what is the common meaning of that word now what was the original meaning do you think thats not intentional 

this system works by cooptimg and reapropriating like the borg in star trek it assimilates its enemies just as well as it assimilates new phenomena in order to sell it and turn it into product feminism has become a capitalist product therefore this feminism ironically is a patriarchal product however there will always be feminisms that have not been coopted as long as there are individuals that hold those beliefs and views who can see through the manipulation so now we have a capitalist simulacra of feminism and non capitalist co  opted feminism just as we now have a commodified form of socialismmarxism which aims to cover up the original to rob it of its agency bright spectacular movie spectacles even those that describe themselves as feminist will always have more of a draw factor than actual feminism 

because many will not see the slight of hand the bait and switch the trompe oleil the coopted and commodified feminists will argue with the noncoopted feminists 

the coopted will become confused and not understanding why they are being criticised so that they presume that it must be because those that criticise either dont understand feminism or that they are antifeminists hence why the preprepared excuses are instantly taken up protecting the new product and infact helping to promote it no news is bad news",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsao2K4844lXJ4N61fH5EkA,-0.9061,negative,True

kill babies

pregnant women are weird

men are obviously evil

women deserve all the power just because

the only thing men deserve is to be at the bottom and powerless because misandry feels really good especially if you label it feminism instead

any woman that wants to be with a man is brainwashed and really just doesnt know who she is

any man that wants to be with a woman is weak and really doesnt know who he is

unless of course that man wants to be with a trans who cant reproduce then its perfectly acceptable

the only way to truly be human and live a meaningful life is to hope to die as soon as possible

18000,@dimitriosz007,24/7/2023,17:25:21,1,"the film barbie despite its potential box office success disappoints on multiple levels as it pushes an overly political agenda and fails to deliver a genuinely empowering message rather than being the enjoyable and lighthearted comedy it was marketed as the film veers into a feminist lecture that alienates its audience including the fans of barbie the director greta gerwig seems to have infused the movie with her ultrawoke mindset resulting in a lack of nuance and depth

from the outset the movie feels like a trojan horse disguising its heavyhanded agenda of perceived male hatred and an obsession with dismantling the patriarchy the supposed empowerment narrative turns out to be a thinly veiled manbashing exercise that trades humor for misguided messages about sexism and patriarchy even the barbieken romance is undermined perpetuating a narrative that emasculates male characters rather than promoting healthy equal relationships

as the plot unfolds the movie takes an unexpected turn with barbies struggle with menopause a topic that feels disconnected and adds to the films lack of coherence the portrayal of ken as a deranged antagonist and the subsequent attempt to establish a matriarchal society in barbie land further detract from the movies credibility

the films failure to balance entertainment with meaningful storytelling exposes larger issues within hollywood as it appears more focused on pushing biased feminist agendas than fostering creativity and joy the movies divisive and biased messages are harmful doing a disservice not only to young girls and women but also to men and families

moreover the films lgbtq connotations may not be inherently problematic but their execution and portrayal could be concerning particularly when aimed at a young audience it is essential to approach such themes with sensitivity and thoughtfulness considering the ageappropriateness of the content and its potential impact on young minds

in conclusion i cannot recommend barbie to anyone seeking an enjoyable and meaningful cinematic experience the films promotion of the fifth wave of feminism seems to have lost sight of what true empowerment means for both women and men it is a shame that such potential for a masterpiece was squandered by the directors agendadriven approach highlighting the broken state of hollywood today this film could have been great but it ultimately falls flat echoing the problematic trends seen in some disney films as well

considering its flaws i would advise against letting young audiences especially nieces and daughters watch this film instead we should seek content that promotes genuine empowerment and fosters positive values",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqgVepXxYoYmtR8OBJUJ_iA,0.9789,positive,True

in the movie ken finds out about how men rule the worldin the real world basically not true but its for plot purposes probs this is one of the two conflicts in the movie no big nonfeminism then no 2nd half of movie so when he finds out its the opposite of barbie land he goes back to barbie land and makes a revolution of sorts he makes the barbies brainwashed for working for the kens and all the men drinking beers and riding horses this part is because of comedic purposes probs blah blah blah the barbies bring everything back to almost normal but at the end ken runs away crying trying to make sure no one sees him he was so focused on getting barbie to like him he kinda changed himself for barbie but barbie gives the speech you need to find yourself because you are your individual not the lover for me specificallyand gives an overall good message another thing they noticed was that before the barbies were treating the kens wrong and during the conflict so they agreed that they should treat each other equally i will say something did get me a little of a bad man good womanvibe but in the end the movie is not damaging for kids it was to tell them to find their individuality which is a good lesson for a maturing kid even though kids can watch it i do think kids arent their demographic during the movie they show a mother who is being pushed away from her kids and she goes to their old barbie dolls for comfort she also draws pictures of cellulite barbie and thoughts of death barbieand in the end she and her daughter are close friends this movie was initially seen as one for kids but if you looked at the plot its for mothers with pretweens also i never got the vibe of brainwashing kids

evoking for a more aware society that shows a woman that she can exist and as her own person
that without the manipulations of a deconstructive society its mass social expectations  and or personal manipulation of another

thats normal feminism

how ever
it includes the reality of a full spectrum of people and their different ideals and or wants
 
like it or not
a business woman within that mentality is as equal to a stay at home mom
same with a female dominant and or submissive
so long as it was eventually their own perceived decisions
and made as freely within their own life

thats it

the only thing that feminism stipulates
is that the manipulation against them need not exist
and then that the education of such choices for themselves need replace it

but not upon a manipulative level
just a constructive one

bad feminism on the other hand
stipulates a personal view over that realization
and usually works up to the reverse of what was actually intended
because it instead unintentionally embraces that chauvinistic value
or strengthens it some how unintentionally

such as an over reach manifesting a reprisal
when we could have instead just kept moving ever happily forwards within more normal equal situations
that were already becoming as prevalent

point is they got every body calling this feminism
not specifically bad feminism

18451,@jeremyrichard2722,19/7/2023,4:52:45,0,"i was curious about the movie and this showed up in my feed 

 to answer a  question from the video i was born in 1975 my cousin amanda was super into barbie as was her mother and my grandmother on that side and so was my stepmother barbie dolls got passed down and my cousin now has custody of my grandmothers collection of barbie stuff my stepmother still buys things like barbie ornaments and sometimes specific dolls like the yearly day of the dead barbie they are doing as she likes that whole thing but it can be hard to get and there is a rapid collectors markup and piracy of that one 

 at any rate i am not a big expert but i do know some of this stuff by association to really get an even more detailed analysis youd have to ask my cousin probably as long as this is going to be but here is what ive picked up from association
 
 barbie is short for barbara and that form of shorthand comes from how society girls and debutantes would shorten the name in their peer group and this made it more friendly barbie was intended to be a specific character who was in what little material existed described as being a high society girl who had made it big in show business she was meant to allow girls to do a sort of perfect life thing through her based on what a few women have in pop culture back when she was invented in the 1960s and was sort of indicative of how tv did that sort of thing everything from her really fancy clothes options to ideal blonde bombshell look was intended to be perfect a point that was later criticized obviously as show business was out on the west coast she did a sort of valley girl thing as wed call it now because that is how a lot of girls like that acted even if they had money or at least in their public persona then of course you had the fancy cars the mansions the beach houses and that kind of stuff ken was designed around the idea of a leading man and typically had things like a tux as a default outfit to sort of emulate who a girl like that might be on the arm of in public 

 barbie as a concept sort of worked around the idea that as she was rich she could travel and have adventures and stuff so different sets reflected anything from like her hanging out on a beach to say playing a role in a movie which she could obviously do to travelling to different countries with themed outfits and tourist stuff for each one 

 it wasnt until decades later in the 80s and 90s that people started to think people should selfidentify as barbie or see her as a role model as opposed to some kind of social super hero this is when you started to see ethnic dolls as barbie as opposed to say friends of barbie with their own names say for example there might be a hawaiian girl named kiki or something from a beach line that had a doll to represent someone she might meet on a trip to hawaii but then later they would just make a doll with those features and say its barbie she is all of these things they are all barbie shes an idea not a character this is also when you saw like doctor barbies and scientist barbies and all of that stuff and why people would make jokes about how she lost her mansion to the irs and had to find a real job and of course parody people made really absurd outfits for her like hooker barbie or dominatrix barbie or whatever this is around the time the video maker would have been playing with it and yeah that is what the toy line implied this is why it was a controversy when a talking doll couldnt say math class is tough or something because she had to be some perfect representation to encourage everything a girl could possibly be that wasnt negative like the parody outfits some people did of that whole attitude 

 at any rate the whole perfect life perfect person super valley girl thing is a pretty accurate depiction of the original barbie concept but wasnt common to the 80s and 90s so much anymore and its also why the simpsons has malibu stacy as their parody of barbie because malibu beach is another really trendy area stereotypically and was sort of poking the idea at the idea especially seeing as there was a throwback malibu barbie line at one point which caused a christmas rush on toy stores much like the cabbage patch kids craze in which people were having brawls to get them due to the popularity of the original california girl concept it should be noted the original 1970s edition of malibu barbie also known as superstar barbie was a surfer girl and part of yet another beach themed line the relaunch in i think it was 1983 that caused the riots im trying to remember howe it went down was more of just a classic barbie type thing as i remember though she did have a beach outfit as part of the core set i always assumed the simpsons made that reference because of the mess caused though",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXJg6y3QA3-PJayQ2G1gLuQ,0.9988,positive,True

i strongly suspected that this movie would be just another wokeattempt from hollywood better called hollywoke now but i decided to give it a chance after all simply because its a barbiemovie which would have been a cool concept if it had actually been a proper barbiemovie instead of this trash that was made byfor feminists

im actually an unofficialinformal expert in human nature particularly in human cognitive psychology sexuality genderdifferences and genderroles and this movie is an insult to anyone whos actually competent about the biological realities of human nature this movie truly is a nuclearattack which your title correctly points out by completely braindead ignorant and deluded feminists on the biological realities of human nature

so thank you for making this video you are completely correct about the incorrectness delusions and hypocrisy of modern feminism third wave feminism and you explained it very well in this video so great job thank god there still are some rational people left in this world



ps
actor simu liu is obviously an insanely braindead ignorant and clueless person when it comes to gender based on the quote from him that you presented in the video 

colourpreferences are biologically genderbased thats simply both an empirical scientific and principle fact of life especially to anyone who has high intelligence and high genderintuition and who thereby is actually capable of seeingnoticing it for themselves on a conscious level 

and sure he would like having the freedom to use any colours he wants but if hes truly honest with himself he wouldnt biologically prefer pink unless he has a biologically feminine male brainan abnormal male brain 

however dumb people and feminists usually have problems understanding that theres a difference between enjoying the freedom of being allowedable to use whatever colour you want and having biological colourpreferences and those 2 things are what simu liu got confused with each other in this quote of his



pps
actress issa rae is obviously also an insanely braindead ignorant and clueless person when it comes to gender specifically the biological genderroles based on the quote from her that you presented in the video and in that quote she might be solely talking about sexually unattractive men who she doesnt feel submissive around and who thereby has nothing to offer her aside from being unimportant interchangable supporting characters in her life as opposed to sexually attractive men

and in addition women often say stupid things like what she said in that quote in a consciousunconscious attempt to challengetest men andor to gain social valuerespectadmiration from other women its the exact same thing that women like beyonce do in their ridiculous completely incorrect female empowermentsonglyrics they try to appear superior despite being inferior in reality which they secretly know perfectly well deep down within themselves",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBek1t4E6BcHZmiWj21-iVg,0.9969,positive,True

of view on many issues related to movies tv shows and gaming however i could not disagree more on the way you have explained the barbie movie here im a woman and i watched barbie and really loved it not because it pushes feminism woke culture and gender ideology by the way theres nothing of the latter in the movie there was said to be a trans barbie in the movie but honestly i dont even remember her since she had no dialogue or if she did she was such a peripheral character that i didnt even notice her but because its a satire on modern ideas of feminism and the outcome of achieving radical feminist goals ie establishing a matriarchy in the beginning all the barbies are in charge of barbieland and the kens are as you rightly described treated as just accessories however this masks the fact that kens are just as capable as barbies and are silently resentful of their roles as they just arent given the chance and support to realise their potential and become important members of their society its basically a reverse representation of the womens rights movement and how the women campaigning for rights at the time felt the kens show how weak purposeless and emasculated a man would become in a matriarchy so much so that when he is finally given an alternative in this case ken going to the real world and discovering the concept of patriarchy which i would like to point out is a very juvenile and exaggerated version of it which he gleans from misinterpreting books and interpersonal interactions and getting a really flawed personal opinion from just one prejudiced man in one short scene he just goes crazy with the power adopting ridiculous stereotypes to fill this gaping hole inside of him that the matriarchal society has created people have also said that if the barbies were so smart why did they let the patriarchy come to and take over barbieland i think it was a smart move to let this happen in the movie since it shows that women are just as laible to being brainwashed as men that they are neither stronger nor weaker than the men in this respect i will admit that there are some annoying bits here and there eg america ferreras rather long speech about unrealistic standards for women however even that speech is not bad since it still resonates with many women today women who dont live privileged lives full of free choice in developed countries but rather live more traditional and restrictive lives in other parts of the world and in the speech its never said that men expect women to rather its said women are expected to  implying that these impossibility high standards that women feel compelled to meet are imposed on them by both men and women which is very realistic for any young women who has had an overly critical mother or maternal figure in their lives the scene in which the kens are duped by the barbies into basically a civil war is also very fun because it again satirises a mans possessiveness of their partner and how his own jealousy can be used against him if hes not careful the outcome of the battle is really surprising and heartening because the kens dont kill each other to decide who gets which barbie but somehow end up uniting at the end and realising they all want the same thing a purpose in life which for these sorry sods was for a long time only barbies attention and approval after the battle scene barbie and ken have a long talk about what both of them want barbie tells him that she doesnt want a relationship with him which coincides with your opinion that the kind of men that feminists want are actually naturally conservative and that a matriarchal society where women constantly keep men down is unlikely to produce men who women are interested in building long term relationships with and that she understands why he did what he did ken realises he needs to let barbie go and find meaning in his life beyond what his society has previously dictated i e just keep barbie happy because she is important and you are not which was the wrong way to live and ultimately led to all this chaos in the end all the barbies decide to give the kens more authority in barbieland and allow them to work their way up just like how women slowly but surely worked their way into all sorts of jobs and professions with time and effort america ferrera also says in the end that shes tired of people expecting women to always be big strong and badass but also a good partner and mother im paraphrasing and that i wish there was a barbie that was just a working woman or just a mother or even neither this i think falls in line with your view of how tired women are of the corporate lifestyle which for many fails to give them the meaning and happiness that they are seeking ferreras daughter in the film verbally abused barbie in the beginning and this scene though comic is not portrayed as a positive act since it makes barbie cry and really hurts her the annoying daughter gradually realises that being so standoffish and mean is something that does not help her or others around her and this eventually leads to her reconciling with her mother honestly the motherdaughter relationship was the most boring part of the movie since it was basically shoved into the background by the second half of the story and not fully developed also in the end barbie chooses to leave barbieland for the real world because she realises that that is the place where she will find true happiness not this artificial world of make believe where half the population is not allowed to grow and thrive

and to the title barbie is nuclear level feminist nonsense that hates men  well a lot of movies were made to make women look stupid and not capable of anything and i could easily say that they hated women why dont you talk about this movies when the male character does everything bold and female character is stupid and is there just to be a love interest welcome to our life do we have 10000 female ytrs complaining everyday about male lead content 

and i am truly sorry but almost all your videos are about this this to me looks more like cash grab and a need to shock your audience or to get a strong emotional reaction and strong emotion  mopre clicks more comments etc  especially from your male viewers like hatred in all caps  not suggestive at all

i am always laughing when some men panic when they experience what women have been experiencing for years and years and they are shocked luckily i have a lot of great guys in my life that focus on them their families and careers and understand that we are now in times of change and it will soon settle down i hope and we will have just movies to enjoy without being hysterical props to you",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtTyZahHpCGRdjetJYeWMcQ,-0.7377,negative,True

speaking of ken yes hes portrayed as dumb incompetent and useless but we need to remember that hes not a real man hes the product of barbies world hes literally the embodiment of how a feminist would write a male character he does not represent a man in the real world

ken is intrigued by the idea of patriarchy and brings it to barbieland because it was the only way he saw that the kens could get rights
and there is even a whole ass musical scene about how the kens see that they needed more rights
since in the barbie franchise kens were literally only created as accessories and boyfriend trophies to the barbies and thus have heavy attachment problems to them
in the end kens patriarchy is stopped by the barbies manipulating them by playing the submissive female and distracting the kens
and barbie tells ken that he doesnt need her to find his purpose without a women it doesnt even end in a big conflict or anything and barbie even admits that she should have been aware of his feelings towards him from the start

also one fun thing about the movie is that you can dissect the movie and find some cognitive dissonance inside of its feminist messages for example sasha is like the biggest fdminist in the movie and is shown in the movie to be avoided by everyone and that her mom had to start playing with dolls because she is so unbearable for everyone",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgJUZxGy1KZG60eAym85onA,-0.9062,negative,True

but damn if most of the good stuff just gets drowned in the approach of telling instead of showing kens patriarchal rules that came from the place of wanting to be respected for who hethey are was a good story telling every second sentence how patriarchy is bad was not there are moments where this really original and refreshing movie becomes some sort of lecture which is quite possibly the most boring way to show things exposition by info dumps rarely end well for the one that experiences things it makes the whole experience really shallow 

and i get that overall this movie was partially a satire of many modern things but christ those mattel executives were just ugh completely unfunny and unnecessary they brought nothing but annoyance even if the idea behind them was laughing at capitalism as a whole and pointing out consumptionism i think there couldve been a better way of showing that or definitely the more funny way

introduction

the upcoming barbie movie has generated significant excitement among fans and moviegoers promising a fun and inspirational film that celebrates empowerment diversity and imagination however recent news about rapper nikki minajs involvement in the project has sparked controversy and raised concerns among certain audiences in this article we will explore the reasons why some feel nikki minajs inclusion may not be the best fit for the barbie movie

image and brand alignment
barbie has been an iconic childrens toy for generations representing ideals of beauty elegance and grace her character symbolizes a positive role model teaching young girls about selfexpression and individuality nikki minaj on the other hand is known for her provocative and sometimes controversial image which includes explicit lyrics bold fashion choices and a hypersexualized persona critics argue that the stark contrast between nikki minajs brand and barbies wholesome image may send conflicting messages to young viewers

parental concerns
given that the barbie movie is primarily aimed at young audiences parents play a crucial role in determining its appropriateness for their children some parents may feel uneasy about nikki minajs presence in the movie due to her adultoriented content and provocative public image these concerns may lead parents to question the films suitability for their impressionable children potentially impacting the movies overall success at the box office

misalignment with the movies message
the barbie movie is expected to deliver empowering messages about selfacceptance resilience and the importance of kindness while nikki minaj is undoubtedly a successful and talented artist her brand and lyrics have often been criticized for promoting materialism vanity and confrontational attitudes critics argue that her involvement in the film could divert the focus away from the movies positive themes and risk sending mixed messages to young viewers

missed opportunities for diverse representation
diversity and inclusivity have become essential aspects of modern storytelling with a growing demand for representation of various cultures and backgrounds in movies some critics argue that nikki minajs casting may not be the most inclusive choice as it perpetuates the stereotype of the sassy and outspoken black woman while it is crucial to celebrate diverse voices in film some argue that the character should have been portrayed by an actress who aligns more closely with barbies uplifting and empowering image

conclusion

the barbie movie has the potential to become a heartwarming and impactful film for audiences worldwide however nikki minajs involvement has sparked debate and concerns about the films messaging and suitability for young viewers while nikki minaj is undoubtedly a talented and successful artist some argue that her image and brand may not align seamlessly with barbies empowering and inspiring character

in the pursuit of promoting diversity and inclusivity it is vital for filmmakers to make thoughtful choices that do not undermine the core message of a beloved and iconic character like barbie as the film progresses it remains to be seen how nikki minajs role will be portrayed and how the films overall impact will be received by audiences of all ages",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWv-LS_VhbPvGHOKyph1bg,0.996,positive,True

pros lots of actors and actresses who are household names and a handful of laugh out loud moments the first 1520 minutes were probably the best part of the film 

cons the movie was clearly political and had an agenda of feminism and toxic masculinity  in barbieland all the kens are pathetic idiots and have no purpose in life in the real world men are toxic and ruin everything  the storyline was pretty vanilla and there was a point it felt like the movie dragged on the film heavily relied on random actors popping in and out who were household names instead of actually keeping you entertained because the story was captivating the plot was so basic youd think the target audience were children but half the jokes were targeted to adults to the point the 7 year old girl sitting behind me kept asking her mom what does that mean mommy

spoilers

the movie begins with barbie land a matriarchal society where women are self confident self sufficient and successful while the ken men counterparts spend the days doing recreational activities at the beach the barbies hold all the job positions such as doctors lawyers and politicians that is the opening premise later on barbie and ken went to the real world and they found out that its a very misogynistic place ken brings the patriarchy to barbie land and the kens took over and became rulers in barbie world the barbies want to turn barbie world back into a matriarchal society and they used the power of feminism to stop the kens and turn their world back to what it was before

that is the whole story for the movie the movies message sexism is badcouldve been handled very well unfortunately it was handled very poorly 

heres how to fix it barbie and ken went to the real world and found out its a very misogynistic place barbie and ken realized that barbie world has the same problem its a very misandric place in other words the two worlds both have sexism in them and they both agreed to work together to stop misogyny and misandry in both worlds

there i fixed it that is what the movies story shouldve been unfortunately thats not what we got instead its yet another men bad women goodmovie by woke hollywood where the men are portrayed as dumb weak and evil while the women are portrayed as smart strong and good in comparison remember last jedi shehulk and ghostbusters 2016 in conclusion this movie is a disappointing dumpster fire and i hope it fails critical drinker is right about this dumpster fire",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_DDYW8t708xYkvPAUVffA,-0.9834,negative,True

the 2023 barbie movie unfortunately neglects to address any notion of faith or family and tries to normalize the idea that men and women cant collaborate positively yuck

 stunning costume design

a really big issue is that every single female in this movie is good and every male is bad maybe alan is a good guy but hes barely a character all of the men we see are incompetent and all of the women are wonderful even when the barbies realize that the kens need to feel they have a right to exist the kens are still portrayed as idiots it couldve been a really interesting examination of inequality but i guess the creators thought misandry would be better",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgtJzzISTeM1-L4ha_FueTA,0.9619,positive,True

1 redefining words is an automatic fallacy
2 the original definition of patriarchymatriarchy is a collectivist society in which the fundamental political entity unit is the family not the individual and there is a ruler or representative in this unit if the leader is a man then that particular family is a patriarchy and if the leader is a woman then that particular family is a matriarchy if there is a tradition in society that men inherit that leadership then the whole society is a patriarchy and if the tradition is that leadership is passed down to women then is a matriarchy
3 feminists have redefined the meaning of patriarchy to mean rule of men within an individual society thus is a fallacy
4 when men eliminated feudalism and replaced it with liberalism men eliminated patriarchy because in liberalism the political unit is the individual not the family
5 in an individualist society if all men rule it has no name but if you wanna make up words then the best would be andriarchy and you could said this was the case before women had the right to vote the reality is that for men this right came with a cost military conscription
6 since women were given the right to vote then it stopped being an andriarchy

i mean i dont spend a penny on movies so may never see it but it sounds rather sinister the way its described  apparently many people dont know what the movie is trying to say which makes it sound almost like actual art where its not spoon fed  either way im not sending money to hollywood  

if a liberal like bill mahr thinks its woke garbage it seems strange that the young  boy on this show  here who i think is supposed to be the conservative voice likes it seems odd  does he like it because it fails by making barbies appear to have no empathy and enjoy torturing men in a world where women rule completely  

the women here says she is a feminist who is anti patriarchy says she is mad that it makes feminists look worse then the  patriarchy   very confusing 

one thing i know in reality and seems this movie speaks to is that at a certain point those who claim opression stop asking for equality when they achieve something close to it or actually achieve it and switch to wanting their turn on being the opressor  like i want the equal right to be the opressor  thats what this sounds like and where we seem in the world today

basically the movie starts with barbie who lives in the barbie world where women rule the doctor is a barbie the garbage collectors are barbies and even the president is a barbie

for plot reasons that arent interesting enough to mention barbie and ken go to the human world where barbie discovers catcalling and sexual harassment ken discovers patriarchy and horses for some reason

ken goes back to the barbie world while barbie stays in human world for plot reasons  

barbie goes back to her world and finds that ken told the other kens about patriarchy and now their barbie world is patriarchal and the girls are all brainwashed into complete submission for kens 

barbie and a few friends who arent brainwashed because of plot reasons start unbrainwashing all the barbies one by one without the kens noticing before turning all the kens against each other which ultimately leads to their patriarchy crumbling down which they accept immediately

the barbie world is back to perfect with little changes aside from the fact that barbie wants to become a human she meets the ghost of the creator of barbie who tells her she can just decide to become human and then disappears 

barbie becomes human and goes to the gynecologist for some reason

this happens this is a thing thats happening currently

the barbies then use toxic femininity to try and win  but ultimately its both barbie and ken having a sincere chat  and ken realising hes more than an accessory 

he then finds a new sense of agency as does barbie to be himself

barbie is then told the patriarchy is a term invent to give reason for all the bad in the world  but is shown how in the real world theres beauty like family and motherhood

why theres so much brainrot from the right about this film just because it pokes fun at men i have no clue and probably shows how insecure some people are

45583,@DerekVuong7799,1/8/2023,18:22:11,0,"barbie is awesome its the most anti woke movie ive ever seen its only appeared to be preachy feminist on the surface its actually really pro men 

spoiler alert but barbie is a good movie its cool that it panders to both woke and anti woke at the sametime

okay im going to speak generally but no offense usually woke people arent as deep and from the surface it looks like an really woke film because it talks about the patriarchy and capitalism and how women are oppressed

if you actually see the actions and listen to the subtitle dialog it makes fun of anti woke and radical feminism and promoted being a mom and family building and having children

heres why i might be over thinking it or it might be added subtitley remember this is a girls toy and its a womens world and i like how in the end it stayed true to that

here is why i think it makes fun of woke culture and radical feminism there are two worlds barbies fantasy land and reality the ideal feminism world where guys are just there is a fantasy land in barbie land ken never got attention and would try to seek out attention it mentioned that ken only feel visible is when barbie notices him when barbie and ken entered the real world they both received attention barbie hates it but ken loves it this is so true for guys guys often feel invisible and when someone tell us that we look good or notices us we would think about it and how awesome that feeling is feminism always state how much guys have it easier and how the system is rigged against women but when ken was trying to be a bunch of different jobshe got rejected due to lack of qualification he even got rejected by a female doctor ken then said i need to go back to barbie fantasy land to make it without qualification

throughout the movie the mother kept thinking about how her daughter didnt love her and there was fiction between them but she loved being a mother playing barbie with her daughter and barbie even said its ruled by men and the mother said its not but it is hard and not perfect but she meant its life life is hard for both gender because you see kens lived experiences and he had to fled back to barbie land for an easier life it showed the mother and her hardship and even through its not perfect its fulfilling which is life life is hard for everyone but fulfilling this statement is even more true when barbie who started living in a radically feminist society who didnt want to break out for bubble like most feminist because she kept choosing to stay and the broken barbie made her go into reality decided to grow up and live in the real world in the end because its more fulfilling when she met with ruth ruth told barbie about made up constructs and mentioned like the patriarchy before barbie went to real world

another funny thing was how in fantasy barbie land it was so easy to convince barbie to be feminist again just with some few simple phases

another thing was when kens fought it literally showed how boys play with their sister or cousins barbies

it also show how hard and how much guys are willing to do for the person they crushed on ken said he never wanted to rule barbie land and that it was hard and he didnt care once he found out patriarchy wasnt about horses and that he wanted barbies house to be their dream home and he was so excited when barbie asked to be his long distance low commitmented girlfriend but try to play it off cool the move mentioned the ken happiest moment was singing to their barbie on the beach in front of the fire and how women has the power to crush the guys dream so badly kens spend their whole lives attracting the girl they love and are just happy being with them but women often dont notice or take advantage of that and they did in the movie

when barbie was driving to her house she talked about how great barbie land was and how it was ruled by women to the daughter and mother and the daughter asked so where does the ken live barbie said she doesnt know she confronted ken when finding out ken took over her house barbie feel hopeless in barbie land for the first time ken after the tabled had turned and ken was like see this is how we feel when women took over everything and barbie realized that it was unfair side note ken didnt establish a patriarchy or a dictatorship instead they put it to a vote but the opposite for the female barbie

even the ceo was thinking about girls when ken was the number one toy the executive asked does it matter if they are selling ken or barbie but the ceo said something along the lines of this is the none creepy ways to make little girls happy

the the lession for guys is you should be yourself and not change who you are or to over try to attract your crush because theres a possibility that she could reject you but instead be yourself hence ken should just be ken

side note only barbie and ken showed real sadness that were from barbie land but even ken tried to hide himself crying and still didnt cry meanwhile barbie cried and shed tears showing that men arent allow to cry",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClrl7KiE4ZlutFRFXz8KQgA,0.9964,positive,True

we mothers stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far theyve come is the line that defined the film for me even though it was only said at the end the beuty of seeing a movie that should represent modern feminism and it actually talks about how motherhood is good and special thats the most impressive plot twist ive seen in years

kill babies

pregnant women are weird

men are obviously evil

women deserve all the power just because

the only thing men deserve is to be at the bottom and powerless because misandry feels really good especially if you label it feminism instead

any woman that wants to be with a man is brainwashed and really just doesnt know who she is

any man that wants to be with a woman is weak and really doesnt know who he is

unless of course that man wants to be with a trans who cant reproduce then its perfectly acceptable

the only way to truly be human and live a meaningful life is to hope to die as soon as possible

from the beginning the doll boasts of having dethroned the babies that promoted motherhood as if telling the feminist public dont forget that we also did that

they also reproach the movement for the treatment the doll received due to its feminine forms and hypersexualized aesthetics while showing them that the companys few slips in the sense of family were immediately written off the pregnant doll is teased throughout the film

the film written by and for feminism is difficult to interpret for the normal audience grotesque and devoid of subtleties they intend to give lessons in morality and sorority using ridicule and the cruelest mockery as a strategy

all that being said to critique a movie you have never seen is incredibly asinine assumptive and self righteous just occasionally you should try not taking yourself and the rest of the world so damn seriously the opinions you express if you had seen the movie would demonstrate just how unsophisticated of a literary critique you are capable of while i would agree that the portrayal of men in the real world was rather belittling ken and his attempts to understand and institute a patriarchy in barbie land were in fact hilarious 

what barbieland attempted to do was create an alternate world were male and female roles were reversed while also to some extent paying homage to the history of barbie now you could certainly argue that it was a relatively shallow version of those roles and that would be a perfectly fair critique it seems that was intentional and allowed both characters room to grow but the movie ultimately had a reasonable message for both men and women which was basically to discover your identity independent of a significant other the messages werent entirely coherent and well thought out but there were some good speeches and a lot of silly humor that if you didnt take yourself so damn seriously you might just be able to laugh at",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjTvx13xIHzKPgiYeBUNUVA,0.7918,positive,True

the barbie movie was intending to say all the horrible things described in this review and the many others bashing it but it was so incompetently written that a lot of its messaging actually said the opposite

the podcast of the lotus eaters review on how its accidentally based pointed out that not only is the feminist fantasyland actually far more oppressive and sexist than the real world has been for decades in the west but the patriarchy taking over barbieland in about five minutes flat so much for a strong independent matriarchy is done nonviolently and works by making the men useful and confident and the women happy enough to start forming actual relationships 

the barbies are so happy in this role that barbie isnt able to talk them out of it so she and the small number of women who have already been shown to be bitter plus allan kens male feminist friend the enabler conspire to brainwash the others out of their happiness and then sabotage the democratic vote on whether kens should have rights by lying to the men about cheating on them ie sexuality and deception the iconic weapons women wield in stories since forever 


the story ends with ken going his own way and barbie realising shes so miserable in the fantasyland shes created that she decides to become a real human woman and then considering motherhood and going to the gynecologist because it turns out there is in fact a link between genitals motherhood and being a real woman

there are a lot of other things they point out but the gist of it is that a lot of the unspoken messages in the film are so close to what antifeminists accuse feminism of doing that it actually makes a stronger argument against the directors views than it does for them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTHvlPh249LMcLI6DYOI6BQ,-0.6312,negative,True

47435,@JonTonyJim,20/11/2023,3:13:20,2,"you hugely misunderstood this movie there are two simultaneous but distinct plots for barbie and ken 

barbies plot is an exploration of the value of women in modern society and goes through the very real struggles that women face in our times 

kens on the other hand is a metaphor to womens suffrage the kens start of as superfluous and are subjugated by barbies and given no respect by them this represents the position of women in society in the patriarchy where they were mothers housekeepers sexual objects and often little else 
the main ken then realises that they dont have to live like that and they break free of the matriarchy to set up a patriarchy it veers from historical suffrage here but still serves a purpose the matriarchy is presented as empowering women but the injustice felt in the patriarchy which is the formers mirror image highlights to radical feministsmisandrists in the audience that a society dominated by one gender is unfair either way

at the end it once again parallels womens suffrage as the barbies return to power and the film very deliberately shows them giving the kens a small role in government stating that they have to start somewhere the metaphor here doesnt really need explaining
 
the parts in the real world are very obviously and deliberately exaggerated but this is for the sake of the plot as the reality of the problems women face is too subtle and insidious to effectively convey in such a limited timeframe

the film is not promen per se it is certainly primarily feminist however i think if you examine it properly you can clearly see it is not a work of male hatred it serves foremost as female empowerment and then as an examination of a society dominated by one gender",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2aLQbU7iduQSId7S5e-h7A,-0.076,negative,True

now she has played with barbie dolls as a kid and im sure part of her dress style was partly inspired by barbie we both expected this to be a silly romantic comedy but it wasnt
my girlfriend was not happy that here was no proper happy ending for barbie and ken even she found the antipatriarchy speech a bit too much 
i mean come on dont feminists have fathers normal and loving fathers surely they cant all have aggressive oppressive abusing alcoholic monsters as fathers
barbie is just a bitter feminist break up movie that openly showed its hatred towards men and while ryan gosling nailed the role and i loved the grease inspired dance scene the kens did the parody of the normandy landings and i also liked how pretty margot robbie is i didnt enjoy the movie at all it left a very bitter taste in my mouth thinking back now only ryan goslings silly antics made the movie watchable

the whole idea of barbie and ken is that they are a couple and they are in love they could have had ken find love with another barbie and that would have been ok but the movie basically told the kens they are not needed and they need to figure out what to do with themselves preferably away from the perfect feminist world of barbieland nobody said it but it was heavily implied
what they did with barbie is that they took an actual good symbol of female empowerment one that teaches women to follow their dreams to embrace their femininity and be loving girlfriends wives and mothers and they twisted that into a symbol of hate one where the divide between men and women grows one where love is replaced with pure hatred for the concept of a traditional family

ken represents the recent history of women in this movie not men at the start like in the 1950s ken only exists to please barbie and spends his entire day just trying to make himself look good and impress her then as with the modern era ken is exposed to the idea he can be more that there is nothing stopping him from becoming a doctor a life guard a president and that he has effectively been repressed by the person he loves for his entire life this causes ken to largely radicalise understandably some might say and push so far the other way that barbie land becomes ken land and tries to enforce patriarchy

barbie representing the modern man in this scenario sees this change in power as a direct attack and gets angry  upset that ken is suddenly the main event and retaliates this is satire at its finest literally analogous to the toxic behaviour of both sides at the extremes who just see everything as an attack on their way of life and respond by attacking further

in the final scenes barbie realises this toxicity is not good for anyone and despite having the option to impose barbie land back on the kens pushes for a middle ground where both parties can live and be the best they can be eventually this is literally what feminism is supposed to be and should be represented as in media and its fucking sad it took this long for someone to make it

it closes with a pointed comment about how the situation in the real world is still not there yet because its not but the solution is neither barbie land or ken land it is both barbie and ken working and sharing together",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCelPnWsHtFG-fB5UigRLapA,0.1111,positive,True

like why i thought barbie land is the utopia of feminism where women are in charge of everything why is there then a need to debate feminist idealogy in the parliament when you live in the supposed utopia of feminism then obviously the way the kens were treated was horrible i refuse to increase my value by devaluing others it is shameful and shallow and not a message young girls should be hearing then the kens which were purposefuly portrayed as not the brightest of men took over feminism land in 48 hours like how its like saying women can only be in charge if all the men around them are stupid brainless mediocre and unambitious and the mojo dojo casa house was basically women being waitresses 

since when was serving a man a drink as a job directly corelated with submission and servitude and why did they have to be reminded of their educational backgrounds and achievements to break the curse of being waitresses that implies that the hard working men and women that work in bars restaurants and other places where they provide customer service are uneducated and stupid the drinker is so correct in saying they are very confused about the message they are trying to pass across they think they are appealing to women but smart people will know how insulting some of these scenes are 

the worst was the ending where things reverted exactly to how they had been the barbies callousness and illtreatment of the kens continued and they further cemented their reign of feminism it made me think of the old barbies like the princess and the pauper where the message of perseverance courage love friendship responsibility hope and fairness where emphasized while the girls were the focus there was no malicious intent towards men in the slightest there was simply no much focus on them because they werent the main characters",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEYXxKaGmbwykzKjswb5Ciw,0.785,positive,True

i dont watch many movies these days because as a whole they are just propaganda for the message so when i was asked to sit and watch it with the family i was prepared to fully dislike it i had also watched this video a while back and had a certain expectation

right away lets just agree that rather ironically ryan gosling is the star of this film the rest of it is passable at best but in no way did i find it as toxic as is made out here it tackles the idea that over simplified ideologies are not the answer to some of the problems that we face today because after all life is far more complicated than than 

barbie is living the feminists dream and yet she is contemplating death internally and is largely ignored when she voices concerns ken is objectified but more than anything thinks his purpose in life in to be wanted by barbie at the expense of a life of his own while she struggles with her meaning for existence he struggles with finding his purpose

when the tables are turned in the real world barbie is the subject of objectivisation and has her character brutally dismantled by a child whos mother has ultimately failed tech her correctly to communicate with others with any sort of respect despite believing that feminism is the answer to the worlds issues

ken realises what it is like to be seen while at the same time pushes to find the boundaries that the patriarchy afford him while he is no longer ignored being able to beach ultimately just isnt enough to get him the full amount of respect he now wants so he goes back to barbieland to act out in the hopes that barbie will finally see him as something other than an accessory

at its core the film has narrative and both main characters have meaningful character developments that if anything leaves them better equipped to move forward with their lives despite largely getting her own way in the end barbie still chooses the harder path by going to the real world and we find she is ultimately not interested in ken not because she sees no value in him as a man but because she just doesnt love him and doesnt find him intellectually stimulating

there are moments of cringe heavyhanded stereotypes and unnecessary fluff but some of my favourite films have this in the opposite direction and i wont begrudge anyone having a poke back remember this film was always going to be female biased but it could easily have been heavily messaged and diverse in all the wrong ways but it wasnt and fir that i think its at least worth a watch",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRG5T6Zl9-Ed_FtaPNSZpw,-0.9355,negative,True

if it truly wanted to say something unique it would subtly comment on the real issues between genders for instance for women things like representation in sport the still existing pay gap in some fields the constant sexualisation of women etc there are real issues with how each gender treats each other and they usually all stem from a society that rewards this behaviour eg women are rewarded financially for sexually exploiting themselves 

instead this film instead managed to say that sexual harassment is bad misogyny is bad etc good messagesif completely surface level unoriginal and uninteresting but my issue is how it demonises men and blames us as a category for these issues the individual man has about as much power politically as the individual women zero the route of almost all of these issues is in fact more complex than all men are evil i could go on but its 3am and im just ranting cos i just finished pirating the film",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCne1TA7v3Os6BRUz_fUsu5w,0.6381,positive,True

1 if barbieland is meant to be a mirror of reality and ken from womens mouths is meant to represent how women feel in real life theyre basically saying women do nothing all day but seek mens approval they dont go to work they dont have jobs they dont have friends they dont even have life they dont do anything expect trying to get the attention of men can you confirm ladies is that all you do all day is that what youre trying to tell us 
2 if patriarchy is real and women are oppressed then wtf is that scene of ken trying to apply for a job only to get turned down because he doesnt have the qualifications hes a straight white male shouldnt have he just got the job and then followed by learning that theres even still female doctors and many other things in the real world too
3 if this is a role reversal then feminism patriarchy in barbieland is something women are doing for men and only doing it for their attentionaffection theyre not actually interested in working or running because the kens say that so are women just feeling unloved which is complete horsehit by men is all is that all women are truly complaining about deep down because even ruth says the patriarchy is made up so women can cope with the struggles of the lifehuman condition
4 again if this is a role reversal then the latina mothers rant actually applies to men and not women also women are never hold themselves accountable for their own actions they place it on men so even that point in the rant doesnt apply to women realistically lol 

all this film realistically showed is that men have hard lives in the real world and worse lives in the fantasies of women still fxck this film because i know that wasnt gretas message and thats not how most women took it but thats actually cosmically objectively what this film is that women are needlessly confusedhatefulbitter creatures that dont know what they want but despise men even more for trying to give them everything but still want everything and that men shouldnt simp for or have their lives revolve around women and that women should treat men better

2 barbie telling ken that hes enough and that his worth isnt dependant on being barbies significant other a message barbie needed to hear for herself this shows that ken and men in general has his worth just like barbie and everyone else it basically says your worth is not tied to your gender nor who you manage to date this is what women had always been conditioned to think  that they should marry well that youre only worth it if you can get a good and rich husband

47726,@bulletmunchr,17/9/2023,4:51:48,0,"this movie made me feel uncomfortable both as a guy and as someone who is gay

while i can understand the criticism that women in barbieland visit the real world and find out dollfeminism hasnt solved all the issues they are still under the mistaken belief that the patriarchy actually exists and had to make everything a ridiculous caricature in order to actually pretend to move the plot along

the whole central b story revolves around the barbies taking back over barbieland complaining about being unequal yet at the end none of the kens were allowed to be equal class citizens in barbieland instead resulting in a nonpregnant matriarchy i guess im not sure how it could be a matriarchy since none of the barbies are moms nor have families

the part that made me uncomfortable as a gay man was how the only acceptable forms of kens in barbieland were completely emasculated and feminized versions of men and with forced samesex kissing against ryan gosling who i assume as stereotypical ken is straight

the ending of the movie is actually kind of ironic the whole plot of the movie is barbie undergoing and not dealing with the existential crisis of actually dying which isnt unique or different among men or women for that matter but then decides to go live in the real world just to join the patriarchy and work as an independent woman falling under the alienating acts of her so called oppressors

i think the main issue here is that movies in which characters clash due to ideological differences which happens in any country where there are big cultural value differences of opinion they didnt talk about how the kens could have just built kendom next door to barbieland and lived in peace isolated goslings character said his only existence was to be the target of the female gaze which the writers never really talk about resolving this existential crisis of the kens and allan but hey barbie got to go live in the real world so i guess all is well

the movie is a 610 i think the political undertones ruined the film as a family friendly comedy where anyone could watch and instead turned into selfinserts about political opinions that are all too common the last 10 years of political discourse",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfFWOoM2N58qZ6gZgcExkaA,0.0801,positive,True

i hate that there are people who hear words like patriarchy and hyperfixate on those the movie literally showed that regardless if men or women are in charge of the world the other is always left in the dust whatever you call it is meaningless in barbieland men are the secondrate citizens and in reality its the complete opposite what more should the movie had done to make this even clearer

one important thing you missed ruth isnt just the ruth character she is actually the late creator of barbie and her story actually clears out a lot of the barbie dolls controversy mattel was run by her and her husband and while he was the creative brain she did more or the business having a daughter she realised just how many toys and overall playing options boys had cowboy pistols and horses i assume that was the movies reference for the patriarchy cowboy theme doctor attire policeman attire  and lots of different career paths they  could depict trough games these are what i remember from an indepth documentary on the other hand the girls only option were baby dolls to take care of a successful businesswoman herself ruth realised how girls are raised to be nothing more than a mom how they are teached since young that their only career is being a housewife but she just couldnt picture a way to fix this stupid belief later on she and her family visited europe and there they found these sx dolls made to comfort men during the ww2 she found them very interesting and brought them home as she never saw dolls depicting adults before molding down the doll to less inappropriate shapes she created this standard young woman doll girls could imagine themselves as they can dress barbie like theyd like to be dressed as they can give barbie the career they wish to have they can surround barbie with the friends and family they wish to make at the time barbie was meant to show girls their possibilities what hyper feminism does is assume that role only to barbie turning her basically into what historically men were and are ruth is a key character there and the reference to her just makes the movie more precious

on this occasion i really liked barbie 
the thing about ken is that he is superfluous to barbie in the real world little girls might have one ken doll and 10 barbies hes an accessory to barbie really so artistically it makes sense that in barbie land the kens are a vapid underclass to me theyre kinda like the fembots in austin powers just funny ironic archetypes that dont need fleshingout 
i thought ken discovering the patriarchy was ironic tongueincheek and hilarious 

a more wellrounded movie would have ended with one ken representative in the government and a place for the kens to live but i can imagine that kind of scene being cut from a film thats called barbie 

back in the day if a feminist had watched austin powers and complained about the fembots we would have said its just a joke love its not making a statement about womens place in the world calm downand maybe thats what we should do with this movies depictions of ken

while i agree that the ending could have been better if the two sides decided to live in an equal and respectful world it is specifically said in the movie that the kens can start having rights and decisionmaking power and finally slowly but surely achieving equality this indirectly means that men have value of their own the movie literally shows and tells this mind you it is not enough but at least we should recognize that theres something for men in the movie

in addition you seem to not have even understood the point the movie was trying to make on motherhood at a certain point the cofemale protagonist literally says that a woman can be anything including being a mother and a mother only if she wants to or being a mother and have a career at the same time or just the latter so i really dont understand your rant about the movie rejecting motherhood the first scene where the little girls smash their dolls shows that women had just one purpose to be a mother and to raise children the movie is not saying that being a mother and raising children is inherently wrong its just that it was the only option women had in the patriarchy

and finally i dont think the movie utterly despises men its just a dystopic and extreme world depicting a sharp contrast men vs women we literally had this in our real world where men ruled alone and despised women for even thinking about being more than a wife not so long ago why cant we invert the parts in a fictional movie  but i think it would made much more sense if the movie kept going in this general direction of both men and women realising the need of an equal world and of each other but they missed the chance to say this message",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4VWwk4Ek-8N4QoJX7g2DQ,-0.7419,negative,True

as if to say that the filmmakers are selfaware and are actually showing clever criticism of a completely ridiculous viewpoint prevalent amongst the left and whil i admit i like this generous explanation on its face call me cynical but it just seems more plausible to me that the filmmakers really are that lacking in selfawareness and are merely accurately portraying their own worldview uncritically without feeling the need to alter it for optics as these kinds of garbage viewpoints as presented are rarely in fact clever stealth criticisma the cultural left more often rather they are a near perfect demonstration of how many leftists and especially leftist creators actually think with the disturbing implications of this being that it exemplifies the fact that they are so out of touch with the reality around them they lack the ability to even conceptualize how others perceive them 

my anecdotal experience with most of the people that i know were left leaning who went to see movies like barbie is they never seem to find anything particularly wrong with the ideological worldview of the film presented so unfortunately if anything it is a exact representation of just how far gone many people on the left in the west really are with movies like these serving as an unintentional litmus tests otherwise clueing us normal andor nuanced enough people with differing opinions on just how the modern tribal left looks at the world around them  as their inability to find much less acknowledge fault within the worldview of these fictionalized portrayals of their own is a testament to that",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScrcjhS1QlZHrUxUtWwaQg,-0.9105,negative,True

the movies villain is literally negativity and bad vibes perpetrated by chronically online haters who masquerade as social activists the motherdaughter are not the good guys in the story ken and barbie are both grow substantially as people but still maintain the things that make them who they are

barbieland wasnt a utopia it was a flawed caricature of what a feminist society would be and was literally just an imaginary construct made up by little girls who play with the dolls when it came down to it and the kens took over everyone was still happy but things still werent quite right 

the solution was somewhere in the middle and the movie ends sort of in the rebuilding stage where the barbies and kens have to figure that part out 

the moral of the story feminist utopia  bad himbo patriarchy  bad self actualization and motherhood  good

the opening scene is meant to contrast with the final scene barbies replaced baby dolls which caused young girls to think more about physical appearance and careers than motherhood but in the end barbie herself chose motherhood over being the icon of barbieland thus flipping the notion on its head it all came full circle and the things in between were shown to be toxic because they made so many people unhappy

we politicize things to try and bash who we disagree withthere is nothing political about discussing the dynamics of gender in society and how that has changed over time or not old white religious men will make reproductive rights political for exampledespite it really being a public health issue if any concern of the broad publics instead of simply the individual",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeGZdzZS_ZXqJXpXF8I6S_w,0.5023,positive,True

firstly portraying a film that promotes gender equality and empowerment as feminist propaganda overlooks the fact that these values benefit society as a whole embracing diverse perspectives and highlighting the strengths of all genders is not an agenda but a step towards creating a fair and inclusive world

secondly labeling a movie as too political dismisses the power of art to address important societal issues films often serve as a platform for conversations about social dynamics cultural shifts and personal growth engaging with these themes can lead to greater awareness and understanding

moreover branding a film as misandry or part of a woke agenda ignores the films intention to challenge stereotypes and promote empathy its crucial to approach media with an open mind recognizing that films can provide opportunities to explore new perspectives and encourage healthy discussions

applying double standards such as appreciating certain thoughtprovoking content while rejecting others hinders the potential for personal growth and understanding rather than making assumptions its essential to delve deeper into the context and messages that the film aims to convey

lets remember that narratives like the barbie movie can play a role in shaping positive attitudes fostering inclusivity and encouraging critical thinking rather than dismissing them based on preconceived notions lets engage with them in a way that promotes genuine dialogue and a broader perspective",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfVj9S3mYkXfNCzyMHk0fQ,0.9965,positive,True

in the beginning the scene where the kids started breaking their baby dolls didnt mean women shouldnt be mothers but more symbolizing women being more than housewives and realizing they could be more in life reminder that the first barbie came out during a time when women were expected to have children and be housewives so the doll would promote women empowerment
the kens being portrayed as dumb was not an attempt at hating men but actively critiquing how kens were made as an accessory to barbies
ken and barbie were never together and barbie openly says she doesnt like ken like that
barbie was portrayed as toxic and materialistic and was not described as perfect
the real world was exaggerated do you think mattel higherups are actually incompetent and act like that of course harassment against women isnt that blunt but it serves its purpose by showing how women are objectified by certain men
i dont think the mother was written very well and her messages about feminism were a bit too blunt but she served her purpose
the movie didnt think kens should be oppressed but shows how overconsumption of certain media may screw with someones mind like ken hearing about the patriarchy and stereotypical manly men made him think he was better than the barbies
in the end they said kens were equal to the barbies but kens didnt get positions of power overnight but had to work for it 
kinda like women getting rights

for me barbie was a pastiche of what matriarchyproponents see as an ideal world its message is that teenagers are mean and cant do anything with their current attitude the girls are named as barbies shittier more consumerist mean girls competitor bratz its her mom an oldstyle feminist who veered into matriarchy territory that was playing with the stereotypical barbie spoilers sorry and its her who brainwashed patriarchied barbies back into matriarchy exactly as she said they have no immune system theyll take any bullshit at face value whether its kens misunderstood version of patriarchy or the previous system

at the end of the barbieland plot everything returns to as it was and thats shown as tragic if everything is mirrored then the screenwriters are propheting a rebound of hardcore patriarchy after misguided 3rd wave feminism irl heck barbie herself is having second thoughts about the affair and the narrator basically reaffirms that any power group would not immediately concede power to create an equal environment even if it were women in charge

the film is a very realistic portrayal of mechanisms of power in the current age and to be fair all other ages a short revolt that ends up setting up current slaves as new masters ends up being overthrown by cunning old masters themselves and its that subvertive undertone that i respect the writers and gerwig for im not sure if margot robbie would sign for it though",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMYsmIran1uNHWOLehoMMxw,0.431,positive,True

however i didnt take the story as an antimen message i took it as a what the world would look like under a matriarchy the answer equally hollow and vapid as the society we live in now in fact if anything its quite proman ken is literally the only character to grow and develop in the whole movie and has an epic power ballad it shows how men have needs wants and desires and shouldnt just be ignored and taken for granted to be used as an accessory now lets say the criticism of it being made by women for women is true apparently were just going to overlook the fact this movie was cowritten by a man so the fk what do you think big movies like john wick mission impossible or fast  furious are aimed at women no theyre aimed primarily at men bloody hell this is the criticism that irritates me the most if women complain they arent represented in movies that are aimed at men men tell them to make their own movies when a movie is clearly aimed at women men complain its antimen 
now let me add that this film is very heavy on barbie lore and history barbie was created in 1959 she was the first adult bodied doll on the market everything about her was designed to encourage girls to think outside of the box of housewife  mother which is why barbie never married ken she was created at a time when women had little to no power and the taste of selfsufficiency they had from working the jobs men had to do in ww2 was being taken away it was barbies dream house it was barbies car barbies various jobs and businesses that she had to have her own income to buy things she wanted with her own bank card women couldnt have a card in their name until 1974 in the us take note barbie is still the only woman to be president of the usa it was only until the early 2000s when barbie started becoming a bimbo when people like paris hilton and katie price started to associate more and more with her aesthetic or the numerous weirdos who dropped thousands in cosmetic surgery  to look like her barbie has always been about feminism and women doing what they choose to do so nobody should be surprised at this",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvI54Vs08rPc4z1DzhUvoZw,-0.6839,negative,True

my theory is that the writers were attempting to make an opposingtheme theme out of this to attempt to show how women were oppressed by men for all of history and then make us feel bad for the men when theyre really talking about women  let me clarify that statement

in the movie imagine that the left is barbie world and the right is the real world not the real world in the movie i mean the actual real world

1  men  women
2  women  men
3  patriarchy  feminism

if you frame it in this way then the men in barbieland represent what the writers feel that women lived for all of history  the patriarchy that ken encounters is actually feminism  or translated in the real world feminism has freed women and made them equal partners in the world  then the story ends by the barbies taking over again  the parallel is that they think in the real world the patriarchy will oppress women again and make them secondclass citizens

barbie world is consistently portrayed as lighthearted dream world for girls everything is perfect there because thats just a girls fantasy ii will not deny that the movie is asymmetric in its treatment of kens and barbies barbie utopia is presented in a better light compared to kens utopia but thats how its supposed to be because well thas barbie thats what barbie was created for its for girls its to make girls dream it cannot be dominated by kens

i actually think this is one of the first movies in a long time to properly show both sides of men and women and that having a world rulled only either one does not work 
its easy to get caught up in the fact the barbies take back their governament in the end but then you forget that the steriotypical barbie chose to become a woman in the real world in the end because she didnt know who she was anymore in a perfect barbie world 

at the same time the movie did put men in a good light by showing they want to have fun and not actually mistreat women that was a joke in itself because even the barbies were ok with having a break from rulling everything of course that the patriarchy they have created would not work as well and thats why they had to dismantle it but i still believe the point was that they reached a consensus in the end that both the extremes were bad 

lets also not forget that while ken was in the real world he was convinced he could do everything he wanted because he was a man when in fact he found that he needs to be qualified to do it and not have it handed down to him just because he is a man this does not seem like a leftist woke message to me

and last but not least ken itself being an icon and a representation for all men his musical act stole the whole movie and for a reason 
this is a message to every man out there that feels like he can only be someone if he has the attention of a woman its an empowerment message for men in general discover who you are you dont need to be validated by women you are a strong independant man you are kenough as you are and to be fair i saw myself in this because i wish someone wouldve told me this when i was younger

also the barbies are easily swayed by the patriarchy because theyre not women theyre barbies they are toys their world is easily influenced by realworld ideas which is why ken changed it effortlessly with the realworld idea of patriarchy and its also why the barbies were easily changed back when informed about the realworld paradox of the conflicting expectations of womanhood the barbies arent women theyre malleable toys apparently having realworld exposure or living as an outcast like stereotypical barbie and weird barbie respectively makes them less susceptible to being changed by realworld ideas


lastly i dont think we were necessarily supposed to sympathise with that girl who wasnt barbies player actually that was her mom im pretty sure the girl represented one side of the argument against barbies  unrealistic expectations that cause body image issues but her mom represented the other argument  its inspiring to see a representation of women who can succeed in any career youre supposed to side with whoever you agree with more they really didnt give a correct answer

first off recreating scene of space oddysey at the beginning doesnt have to be as you said a rip off because yknow it was refrenced in countless productions already games movies tv shows

destrying dolls as symbol of kids abandoning wanting being a mom and choosing consumptiomism instead
it was rather how barbie ariving to market crushed the competition of old dolls

barbieland was also supposed to represent a world by how little girls play with their dolls thats why everything is done by barbies because no little girl wants to play with ken
also theres one weird barbie because theres always that kne girl who brongs her broken barbie to play

and finally i want to add that i dont think that ken message is fuck men but rather refrence to red pill how it grabbed ken attention by tellong him youll be respeced but soon he and everything else became toxicily masculine

about that girl whatever her name yeah i agree but she was rather supposed to represent genz teenager thag uses twitter

the kens are marginalised yes because they live in the fantasy world dreamed up by a little girl and the real world is a parody of how feminists claim the world to be with kens story waking them up to the untruth of men being privileged with ken needing medical degrees instead of being a man  to get a job while getting turned down by a female doctor it shows that hard laboour has nothing to do with female energy being actually done by men and the end shows the toxic feminity through which the barbies use kens attraction to play them out against each other showing that indeed women too can be evil while living in a totally deranged fantasy world thats why  the movie tells the kens need to stop simping

i personally took away a message of male struggle that i believe was not an intentional message from the director my takeaway was that ken gosling lived his life with the sole purpose of being seen and respected by barbie and when she denied him all he wanted was to find a way to matter and gained her attention by this ridiculous portray lot a patriarchy 

when that didnt work or matter either barbie said he has to figure out who he is and it shows him breaking down and being unable to cope with having no conventional meaning ex providing for barbie which is a real struggle men have 

so in short i get what they were going for in the extreme inverted portrayalof how the real worldis and that in reality women are treated as kens were in this movie but my only real takeaway was that men find their self worth and value through providing and earning the respect of women and not being able to do so causes men to struggle with meaning and self worth all in all a rather selfless mentality but ohhh the misogyny",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PYntcTjBZ7aJFGNYrHsPw,-0.9148,negative,True

well since everyone seems to have an opinion about barbie and the headlines wont stop talking about itwhy not ill write my opinion about it too despite knowing no one actually cares about

it is funny to see the absolute meltdown conservatives have over the film especially ben shapiro the guy who is a living embodiment of what the character of steve jobs meant in pirates of the silicon valley when he said how one can be married with kids and still be a virgin i mean really burning barbie dolls and then blaming others for being snowflakes

lets start with the positives first of all brilliant acting margot robbie ryan gosling and will farrell absolutely nailed it also the director did a marvellous job both in terms of acting and visually this is one of the best films made in the last decade overall its a good film

secondly the idea of reversing the roles and show a society where men are the marginalised group is smart its a brilliant tool to create empathy towards what women often experience in the real world

however i do think the writers had so many opportunities to promote a positive message of men and women learning to work together and benefiting from itbut very often it felt like part of the script was written by brilliant artists while the other was scribbled with crayons by their toddlers while they were asleep

warning potential spoilers

lets start with barbie and the real world we get it the real world has patriarchy misogyny people being mistreated based on their genderbut its not that bad is it and it also has a lot of good in it they created an exaggeratedly bad version of reality which fits the modern trend of of critical theorieson everything theories specialised in spouting nonsense how teaching about the enlightenment is racist and how skyscrapers are phallic symbols of male dominance google it this isnt satire

now this creates a serious plot hole after seeing how horrible the real world is why the hell would barbie want to be a real woman in the real world at the end of the film for the outcome to make sense she shouldve also encountered the beautiful sides of this world

mutual support art creativity medical advancements charitiesbarbieland has no homelessness poverty depressionwhich means they also have no ways of dealing with it and showing empathy the barbies never ever learn what empathyis in the film

imagine if her depression and sense of loss in the real world led her to a support groups or some mentorthe old lady at the bus station couldve been that and that would be the agentthat would show her the beautiful thing that is empathyhumans helping each other which would also lead to her wanting to be part of the real world

now lets talk about ken why did he like the idea of patriarchy because in barbieland he was ignored and made to feel worthless his anger came from a place of pain lets think of the song he chose to sing to barbie pushby matchbox twenty

i wanna push you around
well i will well i will
i wanna push you down
well i will well i will
i wanna take you for granted
why does he want to push her around and take her for granted because thats how she was treating him he literally says how hes basically trying to treat her the way she was treating him

but it seems like whoever wrote the script and whoever picked the song were different people because the meaning of the song was completely ignored barbie totally didnt get what he was talking about and the performance of the song was used by the barbies as the perfect time to turn the kens against each other

now lets go to the scene where the kens were fighting each other on the beach thats when i was expecting the main barbie to be horrified by what she was seeing the fighting and animosity the pain and take it in the direction of bringing men and women together to create an equal society where no one is overlooked or mistreated

but no thats not what happened the happy ending is the return to matriarchy and the kens being very quick to swallow their sense of being marginalised i mean if you want the film to have a moral that can be taken into the real world surely let the marginalised group get over it and lets all smilingly go back to how it wasisnt the right message i mean surely the outcome of the ken rebellion against the matriarchy in barbieland should be similar to the outcome wed want to see in the real world against the patriarchy which means accepting the idea that both men and women matter and are capable of achieving professional success and being treated with respect

yes toxic masculinity which is a man believing that mistreating a woman or diminishing her value is normal existsbut so is toxic femininity which is the idea that emotionally manipulating men and not showing compassion is a sign of female empowerment and no its not

 the kens are deliberately portrayed as unimportant to barbieland to show that they have been forced to be in their position because of the barbie matriarchy its them being oppressed rather than a commentary on how men are the writers were trying to convey how negative this state is for men if it ever came to be the way of barbieland in the end the kens also discover they dont need barbie to validate them but to know they are kenough by themselves the movie tries to tackle toxic masculinity as well the kens dont need patriarchy and barbie as their girlfriend to validate that they are amazing and kenough on their on and hey yes that applies to everyone this is your validation for today you are enough give yourself a pat on the back thats quite liberating for them if i dont say so myself though their power in barbieland is another story that i felt wasnt quite as good 
 the way barbie treats the kens is purposefully negative we arent supposed to approve of it we see stereotypical barbie come to realize this and apologize in the end we see at both ends of women rule the world and men rule the world there are downsides to both 
 the relationship between barbies and humans i can agree its inconsistent lol but for the purpose of the movie i think they left it out for good reason the movie presses hard on the childhood magic of barbie with barbie flying off the house into her car 
 thefeminist communist i rather liked how they introduced her as a mother struggling with parenthood of course they went of course with it and even i underestimated the pure radiation of feminism but on her part but does what she say not hold merit i feel its disingenuous not to see the whole picture of her character 
 inequality of kens and barbies at the end um this threw me off as well i wanted to see the kens be better off but it seemed really uncertain and messily tied together it seemed most of the barbies have not learned from their experience which didnt seem satisfactory they were in a powerless position when the kens took over so wouldnt they empathize with the kens now 
all in all i feel as if people who are male watching this may be uncomfortable seeing how barbieland does show them in a place of no power but id like to remind the people who feel that way not to see the forest for the trees the movie is also a message on how we men and women shouldnt keep each other down like that you dont need to be a doctor or an astronaut you dont need to hold power over others you are you and you are enough",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGnPguMN9tPwG5-c925YACA,-0.406,negative,True

49041,@userwithalongworthlessandi8272,4/8/2023,15:29:49,4,"ok i cannot fucking believe film reviewers either for stupidity for ignorance or maybe both do not actually know how to understand the extremely simplistic plot and figures of speech of a kids movie but i guess political brainrot has completely destroyed any human capability to judge fairly a piece of media of the other political side these days
luckily im here for you a fucker that doesnt review shit for living but has seen the movie and  can actually understand a movie meant for 9 year olds also more importantly i can both have a political opinion and a critical brain that judges shit for what is worth and for what it made me feel


lets start from 2 points this guy makes that are complete fabrication over the nature of the film  firstly barbieland is not portrayed as a feminist utopia barbieland is supposed to be satire about how idiotic and naive of a world it is the main fucking point of barbieworld is to show how everyone is a vapid moron that loves dancing every night at barbies house the director also gives an insight to the plot by showing satirically to the viewer that every ken is alienated by their simplistic purpose the same can be said with kentopia where now the roles have reversed and everybody is obsessed by stereotipical machismo horses and singing on the beach to barbie barbieworld is a plot device to jokingly show the stereotypes that will in the future be challenged and overcome call it heros journey or whatever call it even hegelian if you want dialectics ffs but at least understand that the review is full of shit and simplistic
secondly the kid that plays with barbie is not the one playing with her her mother is and the movie doesnt want you to emphasize with her the kid insults barbie and calls the brand fascist after that barbie cries and the film proceeds to completely go against the kid thesis until its end the reviewer doesnt understand the character in question the kid in fact does a complete 180 in the film and magically loves barbie at the end the film wants us to emphasize with the middle aged mother that still plays with barbie yeah what a shock who could have thought that warner bros and barbie predictably arent communist aligned its almost as if barbie is one the most capitalistadjacent conservativelooking representation of a woman

now lets talk about ken ken is not an antagonist in fact ken carries the film as a coprotagonist driving the plot and being the main source of the jokes how the fuck can you not get hes not an antagonist after 5 minutes of ken being portrayed as a badass  also with the best song in the score of the film where the movie tells you literally that kens are liberated from barbie alienation by saying im kenough the antagonist is at best the idea of substituting the barbie ethnostate with the ken ethnostate but that is also not true because the film explicitly makes a point at the end about barbie world being shit and the real world being better i have to honestly say that the barbie world is still maintained but some on its the fucking barbie movie did you really expect them to remove barbie world from its movie

ill finish with another point because im honestly getting tired and i should be studying right now the absolute brainrot of the introductions and conclusions the of the reviewer because this shit stink of intellectual dishonesty can be smelled from miles
lets start with the introduction the fucking 2001 a space odyssey bit i dont know what the hell the reviewer wanted to see here like what is the fucking barbie movie supposed to say fuck the barbies we love traditional dolls this interpretation also feels like the reviewer misundertands the message of the scene in 2001 a space odyssey and its correlation to barbie the theme is one of ascension to another layer of conscience by discovery the apes evlove with the discovery of the monolith from an onesided and simplistic perception of life to a quasihuman intellect   the kids with the discovery of the barbie monolith evolve from an unilateral and simplistic  understanding of what is a doll related to maternity to a more multifaceted understanding of their potential this isnt even a political statement its what factually happened in the last 100 years dolls dont represent just maternity anymore
now with the conclusion the film doesnt say women good men bad thats what people that do not care about even understanding the message because they find it beneath them say lets be clear i find the message completely idiotic and unrealistic but at least i dont strawman it by saying that the film just hates men the real message is that men and girls do not need each other the film comes to that conclusion by explicitly telling ken that barbie never wanted him and that he shouldnt base his existence around being barbies boyfriend after that ken says that hes okay with it and thats the end 

now lets make this shit clear the film is really good its objectively crafted well well executed and extremely well acted the score is great and the barbie references are on point at least they told me so if this channel is what i think it is i know you probably hate it because its against your political views but i at least advise a minimum of intellectual integrity when critiquing a piece of media especially the ones you are politically opposed to",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoaI0cI07xhmUqkrShR-5w,-0.9682,negative,True
49049,@Rymka69,4/8/2023,14:17:11,3,"ok so im trying to understand this criticism is done by someone not missing the messageidea of the movie a bit rather than someone who is appalled by the idea of feminism for the argument about inconsistent logic behind some stuff that happen barbies suddenly under kens control this movie is not about an intricate flawless worldbuilding but prioritizing more feelings emotions the message it wants to show also you can consider the logic to be a childs logic some comments were about this at start kens are basically nothing of value in the barbieworld because when playing with barbies girls would mostly bring out the ken just to be there by her side not really doing anything more or on his own in the movie he doesnt even have a house of his own but is never shown homeless just like girls would not put him in his own house usually  but also would not act as if he is homeless hes just not there for that part

the whole kens overtaking barbieland also kinda follows the logic of the movie because in the movie it is shown how ken becomes a more popular toy so boys playing with the dolls would probably use barbies just as a helper to bring beer or someone to listen to ken talking about some manly stuff computers cars  but the thing that breaks the status is experience of the real world that it is complex so these simple ideas women are only here to listen to men and so on break when you start considering both parties as equally valid interesting and complex beings

the ending so i was a bit confused at first also about the ending actually about quite a few things in the whole film but that changed after not drawing conclusions immediately talking to other people my friends reading reviews from different perspectives so with this comment i hope to give some more insight for people who just did not get everything from beginning and thought that this film is only about hating men anyway back to the sentence i was writing that the barbies just took all the power for themselves again however they said that they allowed like a ken to the committee dont remember the details precisely and later on it is said that hopefully in time kens gain as much influence in politics as women in real life now this to me is an important detail that shows that fixing structural systems is not a one day task it takes work and dedication to even get to a place where women are today and the subtle way it is phrased in the movie that if kens have as much power some day as women now and not just equal highlights that this is not equality and our current system is not equality therefore there is still lots to change before it can be considered equal so both kens of barbieland and women in real life have much to do maybe i worded it weirdly like its womens responsibility to do the work but i didnt mean that

the one other thing that caught my attention from ur critique how you said when barbie is in the real world men are depicted as horrible how she gets slapped on the ass in broad daylight in a crowded area but one thing the men that are shown are depicted as behaving inadequately but it is not to be implied that every man is like that cause like decent men just go about their day without performing some random act of kindness or smth to random women so theres nothing to show from that perspective and also dude you have to realize that that is the real world men do be coming up and slapping random asses women get harassed almost daily and many men are like that so in this way the movie is showing that this behavior has become almost normal in our world but should not be considered normal also to bring back the comparison of real world and barbieland in the beginning barbies do not abuse or harass kens they just do their own thing bringing attention to kens only occasionally which also is not ideal prob men would not want to be considered of only occasionally in real life but the women in the real world have it even worse

to end this thing im aware this movie is not perfect how some ideas of women empowermentbody positivity  are not executed that well sometimes toned down but thats because this movie is basically made with mattel supervising im open to discussing further but taking maybe a deeperwider view context other peoples experiences rather than drawing your own conclusions without any willingness to change them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYREihoLzBRuVbz5MuQ3qg,0.9819,positive,True

next point yes of course the matriarchal system is insane in my opinion it was made to make you think about our current system flip the gender roles once and youll maybe see it it is a caricature and not a goryfication goddammit yes it wasnt resolved as well as it could have been but the realization that no one gender should dominate was definitly there  in barbie and other characters
also a little sidenote about the men whining about feminism yes we still need it just because you have one or more female bosses doesnt mean we have reached equality of course the scene with the bland sexual harrassment may seem a little over the top and unrealistic in a film about toys that are alive bro i mean but i can tell you from real experiences that it would shock you what sick stuff can really happen to women in broad daylight
another sidenote yes it is feminist agenda you may call it woke agenda if you deem it fitting but you yourself are following an agenda you are not unbiased or rational i really hate just calling something an agenda and thus deeming it automatically stupid without really having any arguments nothing and nobody is without ideology or agenda
and last sidenote another message that you were too blind and preoccupied to see feminism isnt about putting down men it is about freeing everyone if you really concern yourself with the bad feminist agenda  and not let some shapiros tell you how insane some of the very radical feminists are youll see that they are fighting for causes that will benefit men and every gender abolishing forced gender roles talking about everyones mental health teaching empathy to not just one gender allowing not just one gender to express feelings or be weak and many more and the movie even parodies and critizes extreme feminists who totally miss the point if you paid any attention
you want nuanced movies then sit down and pay attention you have become the very thing you are so hateful about an extremly biased agendadriven person full of hate and extremely onedimensional in order to please your audience and generate profit",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBdr4b_vFq9YE6bY2LPsf3w,-0.9973,negative,True

barbenheimer was a perfect sales pitch as both are high end psychological and philisophical movies  while oppenheimer was a look into quantum physics barbie was a genius quantum philisophical movie that completely s  on feminism woke culture the alphaself absorbed glamour women and jocks while most surprisingly utterly ing on mattel itself  it also subliminally goes directly at caa which in this movie mattel represents brilliantly likening the entertainers created and marketed as nothing more than a product  and when one dares to try to leave their realm created for them and be a normal human being  they hunt her down and try to rebox her  think brittany spears   the only flaw was the 3rd act when they beat you over the head with the patriarchy having taken over barbieland and how the barbies must deprogram them from an existence they dont seem to have a problem with  but this is acutally a clear indictment on feminism as well  in fact near the very end of the movie they straight out claim that patriarchy is just a made up thing to be basically a coping mechanism  also the real world is not really the real world as one can plainly see but another indictment of feminism and how feminists constantly portray men that are supposed to be in the real world in the movies they create over the top female fiction
the exact end of the movie is also interesting as you see the mother clearly treating her husband exactly how she was complaining about how men supposedly treat women belittling them talking down to them etc   another scathing indictment on feminists  and in the end barbie leaves to become a real woman antiwoke direct attack here a real woman who goes to see a gynecologist for the first time because she now has a vagina  she is a real woman  absolutely brilliant work from greta gerwig  noah baumbach who i had no clue who they were  but it caused me to immediately rent lady bird  which was another very good movie deeply psychological and philisophical  and i will pretty soon watch frances ha as well as gerwig has truly impressed me  for me it is an 8 out of 10 and would have been a 9 if not for the bludgening tool they used in the third act regarding the patriarchy even though it was a intended humiliation of the feminist concept it did however echo some historical moments of earth history of men being manipulated by their women to go to war against each other or say john the baptists death at the manipulating from herodias and her daughter  feminists complain about the historical patriarchy but never mention that many women held considerable power over their men through such manipulation",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPO8JxMpvJzJt0CQSokBOOA,0.9662,positive,True
49130,@dreamup8807,3/8/2023,16:06:00,1,"gotta say i strongly disagree with most of his points mainly the one like its over exaggerated and only focuses on the bad parts of socity that arent accurateor the barbies are oppressing the kensor the barbies are super smart and are portrayed way better than the men
im just gonna state my opinion and it is loooong so if youre not interested in reading allat then thats fine 1 killing two birds with one stole here the parts about the world being bad and exaggerated are done so to be on the same level with the exaggerated airheadedness of the barbies and the kens both of these are massive idiots towards anything in the real world barbie is unaware of how scary and objectiving womanhood can be and that she isnt the slaying girlboss that she thought she was neither does ken know that the patriarchy exists and that his gender often holds more power and authority than the other which is 2 truly something a bit subtly put into this movie but what is a issue effectively addressed at the middle and end barbie world is woman focused at first while letting the kens be whatever but mainly in the shadows they dont even have houses for gods sake and have no goals or ambitions because everything is about barbie and who cares about kensand thats sad then when ken brings in the patriarchy he effectively lets the barbies be objects to bring the kens beer and just be decor in the most degrading way possible while treating them like even bigger idiotsand thats sad see my point neither of these toys are portrayed as smart at all in my opinion its all just a exaggeration of power in either ones arc

and at the end didnt barbie apologize to ken for leaving him in the shadows for so long when they took their power back ken even told barbie when he was sad about not having power anymore beware i am translating this from what i remember and i watched this movie in german so it might not be what he said word for word
i always thought this would be our dream houseand barbie realizes that she held a lot of passive an unintended power over him by justbeing barbie and not just accepting him into her life like he wanted her to or justat all she didnt want him and never realized that she saw him as a something that would just always be there for her to reject so she apologizes to him and tells him that he isnt all those things and is his own person without her he is kenough and thats okay there is and should be a ken without barbiebecause kens deserve respect too even when they mess up they are still just kenspower ballad starts to play im just ken and thats enough
to me the movie has a focus on womanhood because this is a movie about barbie obviously it would be hard to do otherwise but it also highlights the isolating feeling of manhoodhow lonely and hard it can be to live up to standards formed by society on both men and women and that being a man is enough and that you dont have to live for a barbie for a mojo dojo casa house for your job and for the standards you havethese things arent what makes you you and you are good just being you without these things and especially without a barbieno barbie should ever complete you or push a beliehe that you are nothing without something at the end the president barbie even said she wants the kens and barbies to live equally she gives the kens a position somewhere lower on her counsel i believe i am sorry i am writing all of this from memory of the movie and its hard then the narrator even spoke and soon the kens will work their way up from there until the barbies have just as much power as the women in real lifewhich i thought was funny and accurate tbh sorry not sorry

so to summarize the barbie movie wasnt subtle but also wasnt inaccurate at all in my opinion with its portrayal of society in its satirical way if youre a man and you feel like you have to be a certain way to appease women other men your job etc  dont youre enough that is what the movie is trying to say while also telling you that we as woman struggle with womanhood its woman focused it really is but i i woman felt very touched by it and could see myself in a large part of my childhood and felt very heard and seen while appreciating the men in my life that do treat me well like my partner and lastly being a woman is impossible sometimes especially when seeing a critic like this that to me wasnt at all what the message of the movie was so i hope i was understandable and that i didnt form any weird sentences english aint my first language with that saidif you seriously read allat thanks and i wish you a nice way and hope you feel good about yourself",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAwCc4XhwA46mV23o1Vxa7g,0.9957,positive,True

49203,@aliceparkerfilms,2/8/2023,21:40:46,3,"i totally agree the speech bit was quite obvious and overkill and not accurate as an exclusively female experience i think the whole film is easier to understand if you flip the genders in barbieland 
ken went overkill with patricarchy like some women go overkill with feminism eg having one or the other entirely in charge may be what you want if youve been scorned but its not functional hence why i also dislike how people think people think the og barbieland is utopic its actually portrayed as monotonous and unfair which the barbies or men in our real world think is okay because theyve got the power  eg ive not done anything wrong ive never wanted anything to change obviously an ironic line from barbie or ken so obviously being upset when every night is girls night barbie not even knowing where the kens sleep at night is showing ignorance to the other genders in a singlegenderled society midge represents how even if you are the dominant gender you can still have a quality that makes you ignored like how many men technically have dominance but have some quality that is socially undesirable leading to them not being represented
honestly barbies and kens are as thick as eachother and no one has any actual skill but maybe we notice it more in the kens cos its portrayed far less for men to be a bit dim or how in barbieland a woman saying something dim is accepted because shes a barbie again flip the genders for our world this just emphasises how one gender being dominant over another has absolutely nothing to do with skill moral of the story in my eyes is that barbie men is an antagonist for wanting everything to stay the same and ken women is an antagonist for acting spitefully  nobody wins in a world dominated by one gender barbie herself is not a hero until she starts to feel  become human as she begins to create new life instead of being an idea and barbieland works towards equality and encouragingaccepting kens

i think the i am kenough is a clear reflection at so many times women in films get some kind of gimmicky message for the end of movies yes its true but it feels like a token slogan put in to have a pleasing message for half the viewers the obvious i can do it cos im a woman messages are tiring asf

i think a lot of people feel very attacked by this film and honestly i picked that up as an initial reaction but the more i think about and try to look beyond what genders side im on it becomes a much much more meaningful film it is almost entirely ironic satire they could have made it more obvious about the message cos i dont think it came through easily enough clearly

patriarchy and its like the existensial crisis is totally forgotten as a plot point and treated just as an excuse for

just because someone doesnt recommend feminist movies doesnt mean that person is misogynistic but i think these people already know they just want to drown out this criticism by calling this man a misogynist just like want to drown out johnny depp as a wife beater these people never learn",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0FjdnMrESGZWSUGchYccg,-0.9295,negative,True

 ken however  likes the patriarchy and wants to take over barbieland  something women havent tried to do in real life by the way  so you cheer on ken being angry and making over barbieworld  in the male image as that in your mind is the right way the world is and you hate the feminist character who wants exactly the same thing for women in the real world  the feminist character is meant to be objectionable by the way as women dont like her either because shes too extreme  in the end barbie understands kens plight yet things dont change immediately because  in the real world it took over a century before a woman was elected to the supreme court  in america  honestly its not surprising that you dont understand this movie but i hope my review of your review shows you just how much of a misogynist you are",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnzbe-5yiJeHOX3uLdSjMtw,-0.8381,negative,True

basically when the drinker makes the point that sometimes he gets the impression that the film isnt saying what the filmmakers think its saying i disagree i think they are quite aware of the ways they are criticizing modern feminism and gender politics and the mother  daughter story uses barbie to illustrate how feminism changed between generations and the changing demands feminism made of those different generations which is interesting and healthy to explore

in my opinion i think a big point of the movie was just missed in your analysis of course im a just some guy on the internet so what do i know but i think a big theme of the movie wasnt just female empowerment but equality across all genders we see ken create basically a guy paraadiseand then barbie comes to topple it and restore women as the leaders of society in barbieland as the movie ended but when she does restore it you also see how shes unhappy with how the kens are being treated because now shes experienced what thats like in the real world theres also that dialogue with the old woman at the end of the movie that i really liked where she said we make up words like patriarchy to make ourselves more comfortable with how much life just sucks for everyone no matter who you are to me the message of the movie was that a world dominated by women isnt good and neither is a world dominated by men true equality is what we should strive for i think thats a really good concept to highlight because we all live in a time of media where two genders are going against each other you have chumps like andrew tate and all of those sigma male youtubers basically talking about how inferior men are and then you have the female music industry talking about how they dont need men and just use them for moneysexpower its a negative rhetoric on both sides of todays media and barbie was really refreshing to me because it showed that both sides have their own thing that suck about life but that doesnt mean one is better than the other of course this is just my opinion love your moist meter videos and the dialogue they create charlie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-F_UUBdj26F5Lqeejqvghg,0.9831,positive,True

if the visual metaphor of little girls happily destroying the embodiment of motherhood to focus their lives on a shallow and materialistic piece of consumerist trash is lost on you

but the narrator literally tells us point blank that little girls should not blindly cast off matriarchal roles to follow this materialistic consumerist trash the narrator very sarcastically while this doll smashing occurs tells us how following this product made literally everything perfect in the real world with totally nooo issues whatsoeveror at least thats what the people of barbie land would believe

the narratormovie is telling us that the idea of blindly casting aside motherhood and idolizing materialism is not the answer that its pure delusion to think it is and only people living in an actual barbie fantasy land would think otherwise right away the movie is very pointedly shit talking the shallow hypocritical message barbie execs would traditionally claim about barbie that shes a perfect vision a perfect role model and a perfect ideal to strive for 

yes the little girls smash the shit out of their dolls and tea cups but its uncomfortable it doesnt feel like its a pure celebration even the little girls face just seems twisted with anger and uncomfortable i dont think we were supposed to see this as glorious triumph my theory is that if were being fair historically the idea was for boys to have a billion different toys and action figures representing all sorts of roles boys could grow into but historically girls were given pretty much just stay in the kitchen and be a mom do your makeup toys barbie was not and is not a perfect thing but it was legitimately a toy that made it a mission to tell little girls yo you could be a doctor lawyer etc etc etc the doll smashing could be seen as only destroying the embodiment of motherhood but imo its more destroying the very narrow shitty message sent by girl toys in a shittier era because at the same time you can see the embodiment of motherhood in a doll baby for several valid reasonswomengirls also have several valid reasons to look at the baby dolls and see a boring condescending outlook society held for girls

kens were put in the role women traditionally have had societally and though kens lash out its pretty easy to understand and empathize with them even when theyre at their worst the movie and main character could easily stomp on kens throat at the end and cast him out for being a cispartiarchal mansplaining monster instead she recognizes she wasnt good to him she didnt go out of her way to hold ken down but she treated him like scenery and never bothered to help him in anyway which led to pretty deep and valid resentment so she apologizes and the two discuss how he has to find a path and purpose bc he deserves to have one outside of the traditional role he had been provided previously 

which serves as a pretty damn good mirror to the journey of women societally through the last century especially 


now the movie isnt perfect by any means the mothers speech that deprograms a barbie i get it but i dont think she held the kind of cache or familiarity with the audience to get away with it and it held this overly hostile combative tone that flat out contradicts other major parts of the movie but through the entire thing we see that no one has a perfect society or view i dont think were supposed to take anything anyone says at any point as a face value perfect thing which is why the end montage when barbie chooses to try being human doesnt show anger and smashing heteronormative partiarchal blah blah blah it shows normal women living normal lives celebrating marriages careers friendships etc and almost all those  moments involved women and men 

the message seemed to be more than anything that people should be treated with dignity and given every chance to find purpose and joy with other people

yea there are moments of feminism preaching but feminism isnt wrong or bad a lot of the feminist movement is absolutely correct and this movie tended to borrow from the more cooperative human elements of feminism rather than the combative ones for example the tween excoriates barbie as a pathetic fascist piece of consumerist crap again not sure how cd thought the opening was praising consumerist crap the movie goes weellllll out of its way to lambast this aspect of barbie on several occasions as the movie goes along and shit falls apart the mom ends up communicating how yea barbie was never a perfect role model of course not but at the time it was a huge step up just for doing the bare basics of showing little girls they could be something more than just a female kenan accessory in a marriage

i didnt expect to but i thought this was one of the better more genuinely human movies ive seen right next to gotg 3 to reduce this movie to nothing more than evil feminism idk but i think a view like that is missing the forest for a blade of grass

600 adopting a system where both groups are given equal power and respect but nope the barbies go right back to running everything

huh the barbies take back the roles that were without any real merit taken from them so yea theyre in charge again bc they are literally just doing their jobs that they were made to do 

but to leave it at this and this alone is missing some huge stuff

for one thing we get a this giant scene where barbie apologizes to ken for ignoring how he had no role of purpose or way to grow himself she publicly tells him and everyone he deserves a chance to find what makes him happy as do all the kens then we get an entire exchange where kens are put into the court system with the noted goal being for them to work their way up to supreme court in this scene the movie is doing exactly what cd is saying it doesnt do

49523,@RemiusTheAwesome,31/7/2023,16:10:35,5,"this is a movie made by people who utterly despise men and masculinity  honestly this statement is at minimum just as politically driven as the worst moments in this movie and its disappointing to have to type this ive watched a few of your videos and can agree on points but with this one it really feels like youve kind of dipped too deep into your own sauce 

a barbie movie being a giant twitter meme is something to be expected but i at least thought you would appreciate how surprisingly selfaware this movie is of the type of people who echo similar sentiments something i personally feel should be praised heavily in a world where political messages are typically black  white without allowing any sort of grey commentary

right out the gate it pokes fun of how absolutely ridiculous the teenage child is poking fun at her extremist opinions you fascist in the very first scene they introduce her ina significant move considering this child essentially represents the modern mentality around feminismthe version of it that drives you to make videos such as these

so no they dont expect you to empathize with her because shes literally a child regurgitating internet politicsits satire a point that should have been driven home when its revealed that it isnt even the child and her views thats the source of the issues its the mother it even goes as far to poke fun at the fact their main casting choice margot robbie would by that same childs criteria be considered an unrealistic problematic female standard 

the 3rd quarter of the movie goes a bit deep into the lol men are little more than their base flaws jokes and americas long silent rant about how tough it is being a woman was quite indulgent but honestly its nothing to get offended over like seriously men are never once depicted as bad and the patriarchy is little more than the butt of a joke  the kens didnt care about it and none of them even knew what the hell the word even meant it was a standin 

hell the barbie executives should have been considered lowhanging fruit to demonize but they arent even made antagonists  

my real issue though is your they despise masculinity statement which seems comical considering how much masculinity is featured in a movie for female empowerment the plight of the men in this movie is straightforward  they are ignored and thus measure their value by how much female attention theyre getting which is literally zero and the moment theyre given a leg up they overcompensate 

theres a surprising focus on that plight one that isnt covered much in any modern media especially not one thats aimed primarily women because crying over mens issues while covering womens issues is considered taboo regardless of how it fumbles towards the end by adopting a lite its sort of okay for you to suffer mentality the fact it even included an honest apology at the end is mindblowing considering the subject matter and chosen angle of the movie while the barbies at large are perfectly okay with returning to the ken status quo of lowerclass citizens the main character is not which makes all the difference

another confusing thing about your review is that you seem to believe the movie depicted the men as misogynists when none of the main cast in the movie are depicted as such not even by the movies standards an important fact because that is which allowed the movie to end the way it does the message of the supposed superiority of women is also confusing considering the movie is an hour 30 of women essentially coping with the fact that almost nobody in real life is as beautiful or successful as the literal perfect model barbies featured in the movie 

ultimately a movie named barbie with a giant pink logo having an ending where girls rule in a pocket makebelieve universe doesnt sound like something that should draw so much ire

i guess that the best joke is when ken said that as soon as he discovered that patriarchy has nothing to do with horses he lost interest

but it isnt all about bashing guys ken felt they way he did because he was feeling left out he didnt feel like he had value and an identity anymore sound familiar sounds like the conversations we are having about the place of men in a more equitable society ken had to find his own identity that wasnt based on barbies attention or being angry at barbie about having her own identity that is poignant stuff the movie also points out that change in the nature of life something traditionalist men are having trouble dealing with as they have tied so much of their identity to ideas surrounding women without every really considering who they are without women and if men cant figure out what it means to be a man without the context of women that is the problem ken had to become his own person women need to learn to make room for men and men need to learn to make room for women mutual respect is required for us to move forward

49609,@TheTrooper9169666,31/7/2023,2:39:27,5,"i have never disagreed with critical drinker until this movie but here i couldnt disagree more the movie is absolutely feminist but it is definitely not the bad kind of feminism as a matter of fact i might say its that healthy kind of feminism before anyone reads this and crucifies me hear me out

first off  motherhood 

where did you get the idea that its represented as bad one of the main protagonists is a mother and a big part of this movie is her relationship with her daughter during her monologue she says something in the lines of women can be mothers presidents but also mothers and presidents  meaning only that motherhood shouldnt define you  it should be a part of you  i dont think a movie thats against motherhood would ever have such a sentence towards the end of the movie with the appearance of the ghost of the woman who made barbie  motherhood is presented in good light even more first she says she made barbie for her daughter then she explains that mothers stand in place so that their daughters can look back and see how far they got and last but not least  a big part of barbies visions about real world is motherhood  you have that whole cycle of life in those visions and motherhood is very much there she goes to see the gynecologist in the end  well this is absolutely open to interpretation is she seeing him because shes afraid shes got std or is she seeing him to see if her reproductive organs are healthy  i actually think its the latter considering the people she relates to the most  actually the only people she knows in the real world are actually one complete and happy family and in the end barbie is a toy for kids which also implies that if barbie was ever to be a real person of course shed want kids and especially daughter so that she can play with the doll 

second  matriarchate and patriarchate 

this review makes it seem as if barbieland reverts to the initial point  that patriarchate gets cured and everything reverts to the beautiful matriarchate from the beginning of the movie  this is absolutely not true they all figure out that both is wrong and that the only right way is somewhere in between the extremes barbie apologizes to ken for treating him like an object and it is implied that the whole thing is just a beginning for kens on their way to being equally powerful to women in barbieland yes theres also some sarcasm here about it from the narrator but its not like the movie ends at the same point it started far from it

third  kenending of movie

i think his character arc was fantastic you make it seem like its a bad thing they didnt end up together but ken in his initial form basically only sees his existence as tied to barbie he is not ken he is ken and barbie which reminds me of those awful people who seem to only exist as part of their relationship they literally dont have a life on their own which is always a death sentence for relationships in the end he is perfectly aware of this and he realizes that he can actually exist without barbie which is actually kind of reverse female empowerment moment for him as he realizes that he as a man doesnt need a woman to exist and i think it all makes perfect sense

of course there is some women stronk moments in the movie im not saying its the best movie ive ever seen or anything but no matter how deep i looked i didnt see anything sinister or manhating in this movie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9lIGb8bqw5AJ_aZ9cf3vxw,0.9953,positive,True

49613,@t.muller825,31/7/2023,2:03:49,1,"well i have to disagree but not because of the reason someone might think he actually mentioned it in a short commend already because the movie says something completely different from the writers intended message in my mind it isnt important what the artist intended when it comes to art but what the artwork itself says in my experience the artwork is often much smarter then the artist who created it sooooooo why do i disagree with the drinkers analysis

first of all barbie land is a feminist utopia on the first glance but that it isnt is shown pretty quickly in my mind because it is shown that every day is just the same nothing really happens there everything is perfect but shallow and boring it literally looks like a distopian world which pretends to be a utopia but isnt the barbies are actually most of the times only complementing each other and greeting while the kens are shown as obvious 2nd class citizens of course it is depicted with comedic parts but it still comes across pretty clear to me so the first impression is the matriarchy is shallow and creates  righless second class citizens at the same time ryan gosling as ken only wants to be noticed and comes across as actually the most likable character in the movie

so later barbie and ken get to the real world and there it looks like a world straight out of a huffington post article from 2015 some of the incidence where the movie shows the patriarchy are so over the top that it actually comes across like  satire in my mind it doesnt say look how bad the real world is but look how unrealistic these depictions of the so called patriachy are instead i think the butt clap scene demonstrates that the best because it is so unbelievable that it is actually funny

then ken is actually noticed in the real world which clearly makes him very happy which again shows that kens arent valued at all in barbie land then he learns about the real world and who the media says patriachy works so what does he do he tries to use the patriachy to get everything he wants and  it doesnt work for everything he needs qualifications sounds to me like the movie is telling me there is actually a meritocracy and you dont get what you want just because you are a guy at the same time barbie meets the depiction of a woke teenager and she isnt depicted ad likeable at all no she is meen without a reason hostile classmates dont like her because of her character i dont know about you but it doesnt look like the movie wants her to look sympathetic rather the opposite 

later in barbie land when ken established the male dominance but his form of dictatorship comes across much nicer and more humane then the matriarchy we have seen in the beginning the kens actually seem to like and notice the barbies they talk to them about technology or movies and stuff and even trie to be romantic with them if the movie tries to be all girl power why does the patriarchy comes across as so much more likeable then the matriarchy

now how can barbie the one who tries to stop the revolution of the kens succeed she and the other barbies use the kens love to trick them so that they fight they literally use kens love for them as a weapon another move that doesnt look good for them at all and it comes across as critique of the way how some woman use there sexuality

in the end even barbie doesnt wanna live in the restored matriarchy and decides to live in the real world instead

in conclusion if you put aside what the producers probably wanted to say and just look at the movie it actually comes across as anti feminist even though im totally aware of what the producers probably wanted to tell me this movie tells me actually this

1 a matriarchy is actually not desirable

2 feminism isnt about equality

3 many feminist depictions of our society are comically obscure

4 our society is actually mostly a meritocracy

5 to much wokness let you come across as hostile and unlikeable

i meam really the most redeeming qualities have the kens the kens are the ones that struggle the most in this movie the kens are the ones that show love while the barbies dont care about them at all and have created a extremely shallow society at the same time does the real world actually looks far better and is even direct shown as a meritocracy while the feminist monologues are extremely shallow like the society in barbie land in the beginning and the depictions of the patriarchy look like the movie tries to make fun of them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKmEtpv-oUQN0v_i5T1mFRw,0.9983,positive,True

is it a great movie nope
is it an awful one also nope 
im afraid youve fallen onto the this offends me i hate this because it offends me i feel attacked side of things for once critical
maybe try watch it again and find out that its not about attacking men at all its about pointing out how ridiculous all these different commentaries are about both men and women it blows things out of proportion on purpose it shoves the word patriarchy in there repeatedly on purpose just like it shoves in the words superficial and shallow
barbie isnt portrayed as perfect in this shes selfish unaware and questions her worth among other things ken is portrayed as an accessory in this because thats what he always was but they pointed out how wrong that was in the movie barbie points out that ken does have value and he doesnt need to just follow her around to have meaning
and the funny thing is in real life women used to be seen as just an accessory as someone to bear children and raise them to continue on her husbands family name as someone to serve the man of the house as someone who didnt have permission to do anything unless there was a man to chaperone or tell her she could women used to not have their own lives they could not if they did not have a man whether that be a husband father brother or uncle in their lives to answer to then they were nothing
that is essentially what ken has always been to barbie a reversal of roles barbie was always the independent one and ken was always attached to barbie he didnt really have a life of his own he needed her
this movie shows that and it shows how ridiculous that is 
i could continue and write a big essay about this about why the barbies went back to running things in barbieland instead of splitting it equally between them and the kens about why america fererras speech was in it about why they had that guy slap barbies ass in broad daylight but i think that type of thing is best saved for a blog post lol",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa_TCqeNBB7gAEELZil_0xw,-0.9684,negative,True

the worst part of this movie is easily the climax which practically wasnt one and how about the fact that i dont even know what barbieland and looks like anymore is it the same are the men still mindless slaves 

also the mother and daughter were worthless likely inserts who added nothing but that horrific drum banging speech yuck the movie is better without them could have had more humor and better lessons without them

i never saw eye to eye with critical drinkers politics but that if anything made me enjoy him more  the left deserves a good humiliation as long as it is a humiliation of a lot of the shabby garbage produced by hollywood  no doubt there has been too much cgi to many duplicated plots too much inoffensive woke pandering too little reliance on actors and too much studio and marketeer influence

so here comes a movie that that uses hand designed sets hand painted by artists and designers  a movie with a premise only remotely like any before  a movie with large set productions where actors give real performances including singing and with plenty of humour mostly coming from the male actors playing alan and the kens  

and what is the response of drinker you may ask  to acknowledge the degree of effort and craft that went into making the movie to acknowledge the layers of complex references where barbie is everything from a kind of platonic goddess of a female perfect utopia to being called a fascist to being fetished as a commodity  where ken thinks patriarchy is rule by kens and horses 

no drinker is angry because in a movie about a toy that little girls and their sisters and mothers play with the male characters not being played with by any little boys are not the center of attention or the dominate or even equal agent  

yah that would be like making a gi joe movie with barbie in it  its a barbie universe there are no weapons  fighting cannot really harm people    its a world imagined for and by girls and mattel

but goddamnit you were right it was somewhere between the moralizing speeches when i noticed i was just plain old as bored as my
3 year old had become they didnt even make an attempt to spark an intelligent conversation on the topic preferring instead to assume the audience would necessarily agree that a complete barbie autocracy where kens are implied mental and emotional slaves and are homeless is obviously preferable to the reverse 

the storytelling was just so shoddy too whose story was this it is ostensibly set up as barbies heros journey but then all attempts at emotional impact come from the motherdaughter who i am sorry they spend almost no time trying to get us to care about and why did those two suddenly care about barbie land enough to turn around and fight back in the words of one drinker dont knowit wasnt like they knew the cartoonish stakes going on in the real world

1 re the opening with the little girls smashing their baby dolls  ok the smashing part is a bit hectic but it was in reflection to the arrival of barbie being the first of its kind  a dolltoy that represents girls and who they are not just another baby doll and pushing the only role of motherhood to young girls
2 re barbie world being a feminist haven and kens being looked down as a bit silly and irrelevant  thats on purpose as a reflection how in reality women feels a bit silly and irrelevant in real life as a male in the corporate world but a feminist at heart  i see this way too much and is still well and alive im first hand part of the oh the patriarchy is still alive we just hide it well that im trying to change where i can
3 re the movie does portray the real world both good and bad  they are very neutral in their portrayal how men still very much run a lot of the world but hey guys dont always get their way eg ken having that conversation with the doctor to show there have been very decent advancements for females as well but the assslappinginpublic alive and well
4 re then you dig back into how barbie world is reverted back to its feminist paradise  see point 1

i think theres heaps of good bits in the movie you can point out
1 ken saying its ok for boys to cry
2 at the start  kens day is only as good if barbie looks at him  this is a reflection of the opposite in the real world of how girls feel aka pay attention to your gfwife
3 the communist motherdaughter  what her monologue was great  women shouldnt be skinny but healthy butskinny everything she said was very relevant and a reflection on expectations of the modern women

there is something worse than a patriarchy its a zealotocrasy  a world where people are fighting for ideals where the ideals are merely an excuse for the fighting because the fighting is the real point i see this on the right and the left the woke and antiwoke it is also how the road to hell is paved with good intentions we focus on the intentions  but dont stop to consider where the road is going

one day ken will wake up and ask why am i here why are we here we are here to be together it is the labels we throw over each other that keeps us apart it is ultimately our egos that create the labels it is ultimately selfishness that will destroy us all if we really want to make things better we need something more powerful than intentions good or bad

to rationalize a movie about dolls in a barbie world in order to bring it down is a miss barbie is a satire of the systematic objectification of women in media and society its very self aware of how comercial and absurd it is its not that radical also you are taking it waaaaay to seriously and thats why you find it misandrist its not every character is kinda dull they are made out of plastic too its kinda cute how a very specific demographic of the audience is offended to the point of making angry rants that dont focus at all on the actual film the cinematography the edition the montage the stunning production values whatever happened professional criticism

through out the movie we are encouraged to emphatise with ken and his goals barbies whole character arc is going from a selfish person to someone who also cares about others and wants to live a real life the movie even makes fun of patriarchy its almost never mentioned in a serious setting ken discovers that just being a man isnt enough to get a high paying job in the real world the old lady at the end even said something along the lines of patriarchy is something we make up  when things get hard but that is just life 
yes the movie has some tongue and cheek jokes about how women dont have enough power in the real world those can be a bit cringe but come on man those are just little jabs jabs which have a degree of thruth in them

one more thing when you talk about how ridiculous it is for barbie to be slapped from behind in broad daylight at 353 please know that many women experience harassment in public like this regardless of being accompanied by a man i myself and many other women experience inappropriate attention or blatant catcalls like this and it does not matter if we are wearing baggy clothes or a sundress and it does not matter if our boyfriend is there or not please consider the realities of women before you dismiss a very real problem you have some very fair points in some of your videos dont cheapen them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC356OPFvBkECfXcq6PeNhIA,0.9324,positive,True

the fact thaty you think men are oppressed in barbie land but dont think woman are oppressed in the real word says a lot about you  

the point of the movie is that in a matriarchy woman dont want to oppress men they are just there they are accessories but they arent treated poorly  in a patriarchy men search how to opress woman and make them submit to them 

in barbie land barbies have no intention of making the kens submit  

also the point of the movie is that barbie realises that both matriarchy and patriarchy is bad

it may be a kind of female sighted world where the focus is more on females and less on males because it is a mixture of a female fantasy play world and a lot of marketing and kapitalism
but it would be the same if they made a movie about boys toys
there are in fact plenty of movies that are just viewed from a male perspective with noncharacterfemales
but it seems the barbie movie is somehow addressing the fact that ken has no character maybe that was the reason mattel once tried to get barbie a different guy

the scene of children destoying their baby dolls as soon as they found a barbie doll is basicly what happened in the childrens room
it would be the same if people ate the whole time usual bread with cheese and then suddenly a cheeseburger apppeared that was just more fancy and tasty than the stuff before

then finally at the end they concede to let a ken have a minor role in the judiciary which at least acknowledges that you cant give unqualified people important jobs and a systemic change would take time but they never really explore the fact that a systemic change is needed they even joke earlier in the film that the barbies dont even know where the kens live the way they are portrayed is very much like african americans in the 20th century theyre given no thought to their existence and theyre denied any opportunity to grow the social ladder they never go into any of this and have the one token line about having a ken being a lower circuit court judge to give the illusion that theyre acknowledging the social issues but never actually explore them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmi6kxLbYC7xXaPXtuwB1g,0.5883,positive,True

barbies and kens are living in a perfect  plastic world ruled by a matriarch society it looks perfect on the surface level when everyone is only having surface level thoughts
then barbie has an epiphany induced by a greater being in the sky aka a human of thoughts of death and what happens after barbie begins thinking on a more conscious level

what is death this is a deep question to face head on

death in some sense gives meaning to life it is the shadow to the light the black to the white without one we cannot contrast it with the opposite hence this is why most people when they think deeply about it they would choose death over living forever ultimately life would lose purpose where death would be more desired

anyhow with reality seeping into kens mind unfiltered when they go to the overworld he sees everything that barbie world is not all the opposite characteristics and ideologies which is the patriarchy

when ken brings the patriarchy to barbie world all of the barbies and kens tend to be brain washed and adopt a new ideology power structure without thinking deeply yet again like sheep

again the movie presents barbieland where women hold every inch of power and importance as a mirror to the supposed real world where were told men do only barbieland is presented as a utopia while the real world is presented as a spiteful male echo chamber where were incessantly lied to that women are forever under the heel of men again barbie is belittled and berated by some kid destined to grow up an antifa member who starts the movie by calling barbie fascist and ends it by denigrating her dad for appropriation as well she in one scene in a car acts like the female experience is nothing but suffering which in 2023s onlyfans cashapp empowered generation where young women by large today have it easier than ever is astonishing as is the audience being told by the mum in the movie that it is impossible to be a woman and that nothing they ever do is good enough the mum goes off on a 3 minute diatribe about you can be thin but not too thin etc to an audience in our world where its common knowledge that men are shamed bullied and laughed at for being short something they cant change for example yet obese women are routinely protected and pandered to at every opportunity

the movie would actually work if it consistently balanced the more nuanced equal message it rarely offers but so often the movie provides a voicearrogantly speaks on behalf of what is considers every single woman the movies words as if every single woman today is automatically a bullied boxed in victim yet it almost never does the same for the men like when the mums big inspiring speech is a 3 minute onesided rant about how women suffer no matter what you can be a boss but you cant be mean you have to point mens flaws but not too much or youre complaining with her conclusion being that everything is your fault as a woman etc but all ken is given outside of a concluding apology after bizarrely being treated like absolute shit on barbies shoe its never explained why she absolutely despises him regardless of if hes the accessory is a song with deliberate incel vibes the movie then has barbie immediately after provide a critique and a deconstruction of your stereotypical view of alpha manosphere men today which is a reaction to the 3rd wave feminist extremism like shown in this movie which ken has become as if they only build an identity comprised of materialistic things and trophies like a girlfriend shiny clothes and houses boxing them in as nothing more than men not knowing who they are 

this is actually the most nasty and dangerous kind of movie because sitting within it is a fun enjoyable comedy which is how theyll brainwash moviegoers into considering the socialist virtue signalling 3rd wave feminist insanity it is gagging to indoctrinate you into believing as a piece of fun fish out of water satire it could have been a 91010 with it burying you in an echochamber of one sided 3rd wave feminist propaganda that kids will be brainwashed to believe it drops down to a 110",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw9gboS00if7eIX6ScLHaMA,-0.2283,negative,True

kens are barely even objectified they are simply disregarded the barbies want the superficial attention of the kens and kens compete with each other to be noticed but the barbies dont actually want or need the kens even for procreation
barbie goes to the real world for selfish reasons she doesnt want cellulite or flat feet and doesnt want to be ostracised as has happened to others she goes to the real world to solve her own problems and is only interested in solving her owners problems because doing so will solve her own
in the real world barbie is shocked to find that children hate what barbie stands for  impossible standards gratuitous sexualisation etc  while ken finds respect a female stranger politely asks do you have the time sir and he mistakenly attributes that to the existence of the real worlds alleged patriarchy
barbie stays in the real world which is a problem for the mattel company i guess so mattels allmale executives spend the film chasing barbie to get her to go back to barbieland ken meanwhile returns and manages to show the other kens how great the world would be if they ran the place barbies dreamhouse become kens mojo dojo casa house and the kens put the barbies into subservience somehow brainwashing them from doctors and lawyers and executives to bimbos who only want to serve beer and wear maid outfits but this isnt actually shown
barbie simply returns to barbieland with her owner and kens successful coup is presented as a sudden plot twist
barbie and her owner decide the matriarchy must be restored despite how miserable it was so they work on deprogramming the brainwashed barbies and manipulating the kens into fighting each other for the affections of the barbies
the kens realise theyve been played and confront the barbies ken gets extremely upset and explains to barbie that hes just trying to find some kind of meaning and that he has none without her she explains to him that he does have meaning in and of himself and he just needs to find it

i think respect is mutual and impression of others can be selffulfilling if i think all men are awful im discriminating them even before i ever say hi and they might sense my hostility and respond accordingly which actualize the once untrue prejudice awful men exist so do awful women healthy feminism and empowerment should never portrait men as dangerous and powerful irl so that women should be scared and always on guard and be perfect so they can feel enough they are always enough and safe with all the power they need to protect themselves or get help when needed

i think the main point is always men and women should be respectful to each other and decide who they wanna be freely and be accepted by others men are no biologically better than women and vice versa objectifying men disrespectfully is no lighter crime than objectifying women yes we have had a history of unfair patriarchy but that doesnt mean women should do the same to make it even that will just provoke more conflict

movie review
2023s barbie movie directed by greta gerwig and starring margot robbie and ryan gosling relates to all of the points above mattels barbiefashion doll brand is a massive generational ip intellectual property everyone in the world has heard of barbie and probably at one point or another has owned a barbie or ken doll like the walt disney company nintendo company etc anything these companies produce or come out with will be considered an automatic guaranteed success even if it is an objectively and genuinely flawedbad product that doesnt sell and ends up loosing the company money thats simply one of the many benefits of being such a large and wellknown company now regarding the 2023 barbie movie sure its an amusing movie with lost of scenes and musical numbers that would make any adhd person or stoned individual happy and margot robbie does an amazing job portraying a barbielikecharacter however the movie forcefully creates drama and conflict when there wasnt a need in the first place ergo the matriarchalpatriarchal divide of the barbies and the kens that while one group is in the lightand gets to enjoy life the other group must be in the darkand must suffer culminating in an allout female vs male war for dominancy speaking of suffering this movie suffers greatly from being rife with blatant modern neofeministic political messaging dont believe me the word patriarchywas actually used a total of ten 10 separate times throughout the movies 114minute runtime all the barbiesin the movie are propped up coddled empowered strong intelligent capable kind and any other positive attribute you can think of women while all the kensare knocked down weak dumb incapable rude and any other negative attribute you can think of men in fact all of barbies woes in this movie stem from both 1 gloria america ferrera and 2 ken ryan gosling the movie portrays that barbie is not only being twisted by the dark thoughts of gloria in trying to and failing to connect with her daughter so she revisits her comfort toy barbie but it also portrays that barbie is being held back and sabotaged by ken who is just looking to fit in and feel valued appreciated and loved like barbie is otherwise barbie would be perfectly flawless in every single way and could ascend to goddesshood so in this way 2023s barbie attempts to portray ken and the kensas the villains when in reality theyre just average men 2023s barbie also doesnt stick to the original barbie formula barbie being the ideal perfect woman and ken being the ideal perfect man who are the ideal perfect match for each other and who are equals partners 2023s barbie also gets barbies generational personality characteristics and beliefs wrong that she was well known for in this way disneys 2000 lifesizedirected by mark rosman and starring lindsay lohan and tyra banks was a far superior and more accurate portrayal of the barbie brand barbies personality and beliefs and barbies life its actually such a difference that people are now beginning to question if greta gerwig intentionally directed 2023s barbie movie to be a satirical take at barbie and specifically poke fun at todays modern women so all of that being said i gave 2023s barbie a final score of 4510 

to all those who have read this far i would like to first thank you and commend you for your time but secondly if youre willing i would like to challenge you to watch 2023s barbie and then 2000s lifesize please come back here and comment which one you thought was actually better and why i bet youll be surprised barbie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCat8P0KRKg2vgmqz0Td97Bg,0.9992,positive,True

50557,@hypnokitten6450,27/7/2023,8:28:01,2,"huh i think this movie actually laid out a trap and this review kinda fell into it the barbieland as a hate on men because ken was helpless and barbies ran everything the movie actually pointed out the trap early on  barbieland is the mirror of the real world where everything is backward the barbies were actually reflections of a male dominant society 50s80s era and the ken were actually reflections of portrayals of women in that same time period in this mirror effectively the men barbies ran everything had boys nights treated women kens as the decorations who werent really allowed to work and just had to sit around looking pretty etc the women kens attempted to take over but they fell apart when they were turned on each other focused on their mutual hate  which the movie actually calls out with the real world woman talk and the kid earlier on about women hating on other women and therefore staying divided 

pretty much all the commentary this review made about this movie hating men because of the barbieken relationship is actually running into that trap because it was essentially the exact opposite  literally they genderswapped everyone i think to see how people would react if men were in womens roles which honestly kinda freaking brilliant which is why in the end theres no message of lets all get along its a callout how even today power seems to be staying centralized in male roles with men making a lot of the critical decisions for women  trying to roll back womens rights its a us thing maybe not in other countries things are going in a weird way at the moment the barbies men of that society and the matelboard men of the real world both look at all that happen and then effectively reestablish their respective hierarchies  in both cases being essentially menincharge 

the only exception being the realworld woman who manages to sneak in a regular person doll out and barbie herself who just says screw it to all that and just decides to be a regular person  not an empowered superwoman shehulk but just a human who is going to go on about her day as a regular person and ken women is essentially told to stop trying to live his her life trying to be subservient or seek attention or overcompensate but to just be a regular person and figure out who he she is first effectively the happy path message is that both men and women ken and barbie need to stop worrying about other men or women about trying to be perfect about trying to impress people and figure out whom they are first and foremost and just kinda live their own lives 

and in the real world yea most of the men were in fact douches that parts right on that bit went on a bit of a hatespiel and honestly the portrayal of men barbies was actually pretty bad if this critique had approached it from that angle it wouldve been brilliant and probably gotten to the same conclusions but its a testament to the movie that it actually got this review to do exactly what it seemed to intend instead  critique how the treatment of women in society is according to the movie absolutely horrible by pointing out how the men are being treated and getting the review to say that kind of treatment is really horrible

unlike some modern shows which promote entitled female roles barbie is at the beginning an entitled moron but this gets destroyed unlike overall this is just a movie and looking into to deeply is a bit silly in my view this wont change anything of significance
i found it funny throughout especially the michael cerra character who is male 
if it was a warning about anything it was warning about dangerous power dynamics and to be careful how we treat those who love and care for us i felt the men in the movie actually grew stronger after all ken is made for barbie that is his actual purpose but ultimately the movie focused on barbie and rightly so

this is a comedy from a female point of view it makes jokes about certain types of men but so what you defend comics who make jokes about trans or gay people but make fun of men and yall turn into snowflakes the movie comes from a feminist point of view because barbie is a feminist figure  one that the movie acknowledges is problematic it makes jokes about feminism and women too
and honestly i cant believe you are whingeing about the way the kens are portrayed are you also going to start a petition protesting the unfair treatment of balrogs in lord of the rings barbieland is a fantasy a childish female fantasy barbie is a toy for girls ya know the movie absolutely does not paint barbieland as a practical utopia you know how i know why because 1 barbie apologizes to ken and 2 barbie rejects barbieland your review conveniently skipped these points
in the end ken isnt the enemy even the corporate executives arent the enemy the real enemy is any ideology that degrades someone based on their sex i think we can all agree on that one

as much as i hated the supreme court jab at the end the movie is inadvertently promale in many aspects 

the women were more attracted to kens when they were soaking up their manliness 

ken is the most beloved relatable character in the movie so much so there is oscar buzz everyone is rooting for him audience loves him and he delivers all of the laughs  while barbies character is forgetable and doesnt even get a super awesome anthem 
the ken song is trending on spotify and was the biggest wow factor in the movie having people smile from ear to ear 

words like kenergy iamkenough kennection kennaisance kendom are trending  all about ken none about barbie why because the audience actually connected to this character who loves someone that doesnt love him back through willpower he rises above despite the fact that he is always overlooked and even deemed incompetent lets give them this one ken dolls really are neglected by young girls and for the sake of satire was not a ridiculous angle to take in this movie or even unfair given the nature of barbie dolls and careers given to them 

all of these trending hashtags and the ken song speak to a place women drive men when they embrace hyperfeminism an average movie viewer could even conclude that the toxic masculinity presented was the result of being ignored in favor of hyperfeminism 

the kens want to rule over them because of the power women can have over them emotionally and yes this point would be incomplete without the power of female seduction and the women basking in this power while not considering the kens the same can be said with womens old struggle as they have sought power over men precisely because they struggle with men being physically stronger and possessing fearless qualities that make it easier to subdue women fantasize about the assertiveness that comes more natural to men 

i say embrace the kenergy embrace the idea of a mojo dojo casa house embrace ken a man who seeks respect but never actually wants to be a tyrannical ruler 

such were kens accidental objectives
be an intended mockery of your political rivals ideology although they gave him all the best movie moments
become more popular than the good guys 
end up undermining the filmshows subversive themes 
become a cult figure

metaphore of destroying the embodiment of motherhood in the initial scene thats an overinterpretation if ive seen one maybe its my bias as i hate baby dolls but to make my point there is enough jabs at barbies and what they represent not to mention the corporate nature of their manufacturer that it doesnt come off at all the way you describe it

ive also not seen the meanspirited ending kens lack of validation and identity is addressed hes meant to be able to stand on his own so is stereotypical barbies lack of character and any valuable traits the film is surprisingly grounded most of the time okay yeah the buttslap was just bad and contradicts my point and makes jabs at realitydetached feminism and generalisations both ways

barbies treatment of ken is commented on and criticized some peoples perceptions on how your gender is enough to achieve something is commented on and criticized how power and responsibility is a doubleedged sword is commented on the focus seems to be very much constantly on personal value and how you dont need all those external things to feel good about yourself

i also dont understand where youve seen women portrayed only as wonderful and capable in the real world there just isnt a lot of them shown to even make that point the only ones we see other than ruth have serious issues and that fact isnt hidden in any way

then the movie goes on and in the end the barbies stop the kens to make barbieland a patriarchy and the movie finishes with the barbies and the kens understanding that they need to build a more fair place where also kens are considered and represented

this is an analogy with the real world where step by step men and women need to find a way to live in a more balanced way where powers are more equally distributed

moreover patriarchy was only one topic among many there was a baby in an existentialist crisis although this was developed better in toy story a critique of capitalism i know for the yankies the criticism of big corporations is communism itself   and a veiled scolding of the movie industry 
so it turned out to be a very smart but at the same time fun movie of course it is far from perfect for example america ferreras husband was unnecessarily written to a pathetic character also i missed negative female characters but that would have overcomplicated the whole thing so much that it would have ended up being a 3hour movie like nolans",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmm-YCRJMbD9Zp9Q82oy-7g,-0.9186,negative,True

51019,@isaacholzwarth,26/7/2023,4:30:43,2,"at the beginning of this movie i was naively optimistic that maybe conservatives had misinterpreted some lighthearted self deprecating humor about feminism and taken this too seriously the barbies at the beginning treating the kens like toddlers and delivering their cheesy manifestos to the camera made me laugh i thought okay this is good theyre subtly showing the dark side of feminism and the irony of the way ken is treated in the barbie world and theres room for plot development

i was dumbfounded when the movie went the direction it did i actually think theres potential here you have barbie and ken both go to the real world ken discovers what its like to be appreciated and barbie sees that things arent the way they are in barbie land not that shes a victim but in a way that challenges her perception of what life should look like ken takes things too far and starts going down the road of misogyny as an overcorrection for the realisation that hes been treated like dirt and the film wraps up with barbies and kens making peace and finding real purpose and at the end we see parents and children teaching good lessons about life with barbie dolls maybe going a little meta this movie was a parent playing with their child and the child taking barbie and ken out into the real world wherever they went happily ever after the end everybody leaves the theater happy 

instead we got a hateful turd of a movie thats too inappropriate for kids i was uncomfortable with there being so many kids at this movie with the innuendos and blatant crude humor that are in this movie but its not actually intellectual enough for adults but its also crazy toxic its also tonally inconsistent and the ending was so lazy and manipulative trying to make things emotional at the end having done nothing to build towards an emotional ending

i liked the movie but i can see some problems i had no idea the movie would be so much about gender bc deceptive marketing but it made sense if you know barbie history that also why the intro is like that its not bashing mothers but girls having to play with only baby dolls a lot of this movie is about barbie history which if you havent watched the hour barbie documentary like i have itll be hard to get so much talk about barbie being fascist gender stereotypes and patriarchy is wrapped up in something no one has watched thats why i saw kens whole patriarchy thing as a physical representation about how male dolls are useless literal accessories to women and him trying to forge his own identity but it didnt go that way

i love the movie for its campiness but it fumbled the ending definitely it also had issues in pacing and every character outside from barbie and ken being pointlesswe didnt even get to find out what the damn box was why ken taking over if the toys were selling mattered why the daughter suddenly liked barbie or even cared that she quit what is barbie land and why isnt called barbie world and much more nitpicks but the biggest problem is that there wasnt an equality ending instead of just slapping kens in the face why was all of kens emotional development in a very long song i didnt even catch he was talking about how he felt he wasnt enough because i tuned out of the song halfway

i really do feel bad for the kids though because its really not a kids movie its a movie for adults about the deconstruction of barbie and sure its colorful but the theming and adult humor is something a kid cant attach themselves to

overall i give it a 6510

its directed well the acting is good the sets are awesome and so is the costume design but the story takes a weird turn and has parts only people who know doll history will understand plus it muddles its message in the ending section",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7xMorSoIIuc0YQ4onmOQwQ,0.9355,positive,True

this movie is layered and that is the point and the target is not as you think men men are in no way part of this conversation its not about you or me this film is a conversation between 2nd generation feminists representing barbie and the ideology that that toy has had over the years and 3rd generation feminists represented by the kens the target audience is the small girls who risk being subverted by the 3rd generation feminist

it sets up a world where barbies live and rule based on hard work and competence they are successful and this hard work leads to success the key here is not that they are female dolls but that they work hard and hence have good jobs that give the nice things like cars and houses they live the life that we traditionally associate with men this is also the life that barbie promotes strive hard and you can be what ever you want to be you also have kens in this world yes they are mostly all males and they are all pretty toyboys male bimbos if you like they are all incompetent they own nothing and they only exist as romantic interests for the barbies they are totally objectified and they can only exist as a relationship to the barbies they have a traditional female role

this is a world where everything is reversed and its reversed because this is the only way you can criticise 3rd generation feminism

so when they go into the real world witch btw is not real or at least it does not symbolize the real world ken learns about patriarchy he then becomes self entitled enlightened by patriarchy he goes back to barbie world and starts taking over because he read something in a book and because he is a male not because he is competent not only that he also managed to brainwash the competent barbies that have all worked hard for there houses that in this new world they should be total soygirls although they are competent  

now if the roles where not reversed and ken was a girl she would not be enlightened by patriarchy but by matriarchy or 3rd gen feminism 

so barbie 2nd generation feminist comes back and has to save the barbies from the 3rd generation feminists the kens promoting her 2nd generation ideals of working hard and be what you want to be instead of being a self entitled bitch because you feel you have been oppressed and now its your time to rule

the entire time i was questioning if we even saw the same movie

maybe its a different approach to film consumption which would be odd since ive been watching and agreeing with your videos for a very long time but to me the movie was parodying the misandrist garbage that gets funneled out of hollywood

one of the more obvious hiccups you made is that there isnt a barbie for every barbie thats owned theres a barbie for every type theyve put out the joke about allen being the only allen and the discontinued dolls were the more obvious ones its also why theres only one weird barbie as shes supposed to represent all of the abused barbie dolls stereotypical barbie getting flaws was supposed to reflect a changing view of the barbie brand and was a metaphor for change

the barbies in general also arent all too smart or even empowered their mindsets being simplistic as the doll theyre represented by theyre incapable of complex thought or moving outside of the metaphorical box mattel placed on them which is why they were so easily brainwashed its why theres doctor barbie and president barbie no one has actual names

the whole patriarchy thing is treated as a joke as well where ken automatically assumes he can be a doctor or be paid to stand at the beach because hes a guy showing that both kens and barbies have an extremely juvenile outlook on reality hell ken even says that he lost interest in the idea when he found out the patriarchy wasnt about horses because everyone in barbie land has the mindset of a child

i also feel like im the only person that saw the daughter being all edgy as a joke made at the expense of feminist attacks on barbie

what took me off guard was that the movie admitted that barbie lead ken on and neglected him as a romantic partner when she wasnt actually into him and that she was in the wrong i couldnt imagine something like shehulk placing blame like that on a female character

the most outlandish things i saw were a joke about barbie curing sexism at the beginning of the film which the movie showed she didnt and the joke about the kens getting as much power as women have in the real world and again those came off as jokes rather than forcing a political message

maybe i just watched the movie wrong though to me the angry response people are having is like if they watched the lego movie and left thinking the message was imagination is bad and unquestioning conformity is good

edit i actually remember one more joke when barbie and ken go up to a construction site thinking that theyd get help but barbie just gets catcalled she then informed them all that because shes a barbie she doesnt have a vagina the construction workers took this to mean she was trans and didnt make a big deal out of it one of them even said that he didnt mind then ken said i have all the genitals as they were walking away the construction workers also didnt take issue with the implication that ken was intersex so the idea that the real world was all hateful doesnt make sense",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClxx7CVE5OJv2ncCCjFLjXA,-0.9569,negative,True

the little girl was never supposed to be likeable she was a bad person off the bat and was made better by her mother finding herself 

the real world being excessively horrible and sexist is yeah exaggerated but as you said it was in contrast to the barbie world that was the point you basically said it but came to the wrong conclusion and plus its a comedy mvoie why would they be nuanced when they can be comical 

ken never gets treated badly by barbie he likes and her she doesnt but shes never rude to him or treats him horribly 

the men being second class beings at the start is a metaphor for women who feel that way now 

ken flips all the barbies when he comes back with patriarchy because as the movie put it it was like not having defenses against a disease from foreign lands 

the final resolution and message is that kens and barbies are better together and that neither should never have time for each other 

the girls at the start smashing the dolls i guess might have been a metaphor but im pretty sure baby dolls were just the most popular doll before barbies but thats an i think opinion",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRmVh1LMN3BQiMvY3aERQg,0.9651,positive,True

for starters almost everything that happens in barbie is pretty expressly hyperbolical and tongueincheek the lopsided gender dynamic in their fictional world is an exaggerated mirror to the mostlypatriarchal society of today not some idealized model of how things should be the ending where the barbies acquiesce to have at least a token representation of kens in the power structure is very much a part of that

finally its not like the film is trying to be some kind of definitive verdict on modern gender issues rather as far as i could tell the ending represented leaving the childhood safe haven of simplistic absolutes barbieland and facing your looming mortality while trying to find your place in the complex world of adulthood sort of like the girl who actually played with the main barbie  who by the way was actually not the girl you described but her mom

still based on watching many of your other videos im fairly confident you have the mental capacities to discern all this that leads me to believe that you chose this way of presenting the movie to artificially generate outrage and pander to a demographic who gets easily angered by trivialities in the entertainment industry  sort of like the modern audiences strawman you keep mocking on this channel funny how that works out

it could also be interpreted as a reflection to feminism but with the roles reversed in this film ken which ironically represented feminism went from a matriarchal society to the reverse and went so far the other way which reflects what some of the more extreme feminists had become all you had to do is switch the genders in barbieland and realize how close of a reflection it is to our modern times

51736,@jonsnowknows,25/7/2023,6:09:25,13,"i do enjoy watching your reviews although i dont agree with most of your points simply because there are some interesting arguments in them like the fact that female protagonists have to be perfect these days despite that not being a positive way of protraying them not just from a storytelling perspective but also for the women themselves

now comes a movie that doesnt do that and you completely shit on it since you can barely focus on its message and instead how it looks at men and how it invalidates your ideas of women both from your highly opinionated point of view it really made me wanna see the movie instead of waiting for it to come to streaming quite the barbie streisand effect if you will

the visual metaphor of the beginning is not lost on anyone especially since the movie is addressing both sides of it during its course

barbieland is not a feminist utopia that is exactly how angry men like to see feminism its a poignant portrayal of a toy for girls that centers around barbie and literally has ken as more of an accessory than a real character its not that hard to understand if you werent trying to be butthurt every step of the way to an extent it is also an exaggerated mirror image of the mid 20th century real world as becomes clear if you paid attention to the ending which you prove you didnt in several parts of this video

youre 100 describing that mirror image after that and instead of realizing it you conclude that the writers hate men absolute genius

your next point about the reflection of the real world even though its pretty funny you are so oblivious about the mirroring unless its literal is valid its just kind of pitiful

imagine for a second you come from barbieland where man have no standing whatsoever to the real world if you think you would just see the nuances right away that are actually shown once we get to the mattel headquarters instead of getting shockedthink again or try talking to a woman about her experiences in the real world maybe one that isnt inside of your bubble

asshole communist activist feminist starting like that into describing a character that is reflecting what a lot of young women are feeling simply requires no response how about that nuance youre asking of the movie could you maybe show some of that

ken is experiencing basic human decency yeah thats exactly what the film is saying the fact that it doesnt end there but goes to a place where women get disrespected gets conveniently ignored

then comes my favourite part how can strong empowered infallible barbies be subjugated so easily because they are not all that youre really gonna criticise the unrealistic portrayal of women and now at the same time criticise this movie for not doing that and actually giving the characters space to grow fuck me this review is terrible

the end is everything going back to the way it was did you literally walk out of the cinema 10 minutes before it concluded talking of realism and nuance you really expect to go from matriarchy to perfectly equal society in the course of this movie instead of a stepbystep process that got started by the end of it just like it works in the real world

looking back youre really damn hypocritical when it comes to your movie criticism if its not to your liking it should pretty please go to a place that suits you in the most unrealistic way possible go away now",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvei-sFc8RPic-6K-i7ZBw,-0.9135,negative,True

the kens were oppressed in a matriarchal society causing great civil unrest the kens installed a patriarchy which was portrayed as just as oppressive both these things are seen as bad which is why barbie leaves once the matriarchy is restored

the real world is portrayed as on a surfacelevel misogynistic but actually far more complicated than that the real world humans explicitly told ken just because hes a man in the real world doesnt mean you have inherently more power than women and stuff like the sexual harassment barbie faced on arrival is sadly actually quite realistic and if you think otherwise you dont hang out with women enough

and theyre not actually men and women nor supposed to be  theyre barbie and ken dolls and thus the socialpolitical message is kinda mute of course kens are subservient to barbies theyre the toys of little girls not boys ken has always been secondary to barbie and theyre both as vapid and shallow as each other until stereotypical barbie develops selfawareness

needing the men of this movie to be taken seriously in order for the women to be allowed a universe in which they are free to feel limitless and confident feels a lot like the woke agenda you often speak against once barbie evolves she encourages ken to step out of his role defined by the matriarchy the only time men were hated in this movie is when they ruined the lives of the women disregarding them wasnt hate barbies just wanted to live their lives on their own terms and that was so offensive to the men 
as to how ridiculous it is to have girls shown as oppressed while trying to simultaneously say they can be whatever they want barbie represents being anything you want and girls who feel oppressed by the patriarchy enjoy that escape 
little girls should be allowed to play and pretend to be women not always moms or caregivers the point of the movie that women can exist in their own right and it have nothing to do with men is a concept that exists in young girls minds it wasnt invented by screenwriters not everything has to include a man",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcSpsYux890o7EqXww989jA,0.8836,positive,True

By using the toy as the discussion point was a genius way of tackling modern day matriarchal and patriarchal standards.

51880,@ameliacampbell5526,25/7/2023,1:31:31,0,"i want to start this by saying i am 100 the target audience of this movie as a young adult both me and my mid50s mother who grew up immersed in older feminist ideals adored this movie im a big critical drinker fan and i completely believe in interpreting movies however you like but i feel this interpretation missed the mark 
first this was not a kids movie i even thought from the pr this was pretty obvious it was rated pg13 and the messaging in the movie was clearly directed at adults this was even reflected in the storytelling as barbie was connected to the mother not the child children and apparently some adults couldnt understand the more complicated message of this movie which does superficially come off as manhating
second this review missed the point of the social commentary barbie made this was not a happy ending it wasnt supposed to be it was meant to leave you with an ickfeeling in your mouth because of the way the kens were treated in case it wasnt obvious the movie was a gender swap if you think the real world was solved by people in power realizing they are being mean and immediately erasing all disparity and inequality i dont know what to tell you 
unify behind a simple message of reconciliation ok and have everything be perfect and have the moral of the story be that everything works out perfectly once we all decide to be besties this movie plays out silly and surrealistic of course like the history of people fighting for power and being mocked for it again gender swap anyone ken isnt happy in the patriarchy but feels he has no choice but to stay in it in order to fit the stereotypical strong man persona but this hurts him as it does real men in society the movies hokey ken song which i unironically love talks about how men are put down by both poor demonstrations of feminism and the patriarchy 
maybe im reading too deep into it but i didnt leave the movie thinking the barbies were the good guys i again saw power fighting power in the form of gender and a realistic outcome barbies realization that that the gender debate isnt what being in the real world is all about its human emotions that her and ken shared that is the root of what truly matters above anything else and for those of you upset over the kens only getting minute positions in government at the end of the movie how do you think women started out in government randomly spawned onto the supreme court after not being allowed to vote
third this movie makes fun of stereotypical menthings in the same way stereotypical womenthings have been made fun of for years as noted in other critical drinker reviews the erasure of all things girlyto make female protagonists appear stronger is frustrating this movie basks in pink and cute outfits and silly songsand now this is a stupid negative thing pick a side 
fourth this movie has some flaws and some big ones i didnt like the opening scene where they smash the dolls i agree this completely refutes the point on motherhood they talk about later and the devaluing of motherhood is a huge issue especially in american society i also didnt understand will farells character i think it wouldve been more interesting and a better message to make him competent and yet still a good guy to show not all powerful men have to be the bad guys 

overall i as a young woman didnt necessarily find this movie empowering i found it thought provoking which is what cinema needs more of nowadays taking this movie superficially and getting mad at its face value is why movies in recent years feel dumbed down to be digestible by audiences and usually fail making a weird and pointless agenda out of an action movie barbie has been used as a symbol of feminism both positively and negatively and if you think there was no place for feminism in this moviewhy exactly did you go see it if you felt personally attacked by this movie youre the kind of person it was about still a big fan of the critical drinker just thought id throw this out there for anyone else searching the comments for something positive about this movie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUzlVOSguoiL276lkIaIT6g,0.9818,positive,True

the beginning was just a juxtaposition of what a matriarchy would look like vs the patriarchy prior to the 1970s the kens of barbieland are women prior to the 1970s

the rest of the movie is just what it should be focusing on women specifically mother and daughter dynamics or frustrations 

the worst i could say about this movie as a man is that it felt like walking into a department store 90 of things in there are for women 10 for men but thats ok because not every movie has to be for me or everyone

what i agree on
marketing is deceiving indeed and some kids that might have wanted to just have fun probably didnt get it as much some scenes like those with mattel guys are unnecessary and the representation of men in real world should have been more realistic by displaying decent men the underlying logicrelationship between real world and barbie land is indeed flawed and of course the movie is preachy and contradicts itself when barbies get brainwashed in a day

what i disagree on
opening is no rip off nor a symbol of motherhood rejection it is like just showing the story of dolls and how barbie offered something more than just babies i mean the latina mother and daughter are there to show being a mother is just as good as anything else and vice versa kens having no relevance in barbieland at the beginning makes sense because ken was indeed just an accessory for barbie toys it is literally what ken says all tiem time it is barbie and ken it has never been ken and barbie acknowledges that is not correct that it should be its barbie and its ken yeah it would have been better if kens were made to play a more important role within barbieland at the end you know show dont tell but i dont feel the creators utterly despise men the conclusion of kens arc literally goes in the opposite direction

i read somewhere that ken being a 2nd class citizen in barbie is how women have been portrayed in like 90 of all movies and i agree but again at least in barbie there is a canon reason for it asstated above so it really doesnt feel to me that the creators hate men it is not mean spiritied either on the contrary it has a powerful message albeit on the nose to both men and women

thats just me other than that i think the praise it is getting shouldnt be that high storywise it does have its flaws and i didnt find it all that exciting but i did enjoy it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpfT-kZV18C3mnBYBfmHUow,0.961,positive,True

52178,@girlwriteswhat,24/7/2023,19:15:11,23,"well its a feminist message

whenever they say feminism was never about manhating remember the entire premise that patriarchy is at its root corrupt and oppressive puts the lie to that statement 

patriarchy as defined by them is a system where men hold the power and women are largely or entirely excluded from it and it has existed basically since civilization has existed at least 5000 years likely longer 

and according to them patriarchy is the instigator and perpetuator of all war poverty suffering dishonesty oppression violence crime abuse bullying inequity inequality corruption cruelty exploitation pollution hierarchy etc 

and patriarchys affect on women

the history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpation on the part of man toward woman having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her  elizabeth cady stanton the declaration of sentiments 1848 

think about the implications of this claim 

every man is birthed by a woman his first experience of comfort and sustenance is at a womans breast during the entirety of his most crucial formative years birth until age 6 or 7 his mother andor other female caregivers will have the greatest influence on his personality temperament and understanding of the world 

his mother will be the first person with whom he forms a deep and meaningful emotional attachment and physical dependence she is the milk that fills his hungry belly she is the nurse who soothes his fevers and bandages his wounds she is the smiling tender face that greets him every morning and bids him sweet dreams at night

his fathers role in his day to day life is a step removed what does a toddler know about a mans role he has no way to conceptualize that it is his father who provides the family the roof over their heads or the food his mother prepares and spoons into his mouth 

in times of danger scarcity or strife his father may be absent off to war or outside fending off raiders or predators or working far away and sending money home to sustain the family but what does a toddler know about war or predators or commerce all he knows is that women are the immediate providers of everything he requires when father is away mother and sisters and aunts and grandmothers are a constant the woman is his anchor his lifeblood his everything

to him his existence is made possible through the benevolence care and nurturing of women and chances are he will one day have a wife and daughters

and yet once he is grown once he is a man he will turn on women with repeated injuries and usurpation 

even if he is not a powerful man who can dictate the rules he will tolerate a misogynist system that oppresses and marginalizes the very people with whom he formed his deepest and most abiding emotional bonds during his most crucial developmental years

and this has been happening for at least 50 centuries 

feminism is the radical notion that women are people

no feminism is the radical notion that men are sociopaths not even 5000 years of men being directly nurtured sustained taught and enculturated by women throughout the most influential phase of their lives has convinced men that women are people deserving of rights dignity protection respect or care

if we are to take elizabeth cady stantons claim at face value we must conclude that men are fundamentally sociopathic and we must consider that even after more than 150 years of feminism men have been unable to learn that women are people

that is the ultimate conclusion of feminisms core false accusation premise dating all the way back to 1848 feminism is the radical notion that men are intractably and incurably inhuman

the fact that the writers didnt really know where to go with the idea of barbieland vs reality shows that the script has tons of flaws they got almost two hours of time but they really waste it the barbie world is very one dimensional and stereotypical thats fine thats what we all expected girls play with barbies they put girls in positions of powers also because real worlds patriarchy is dominating the real world perfectly fine 

but the real world is shown also one dimensional even though there definitely would have been more than enough time to give a broad impression of what the world is like by the way barbie and ken were really lucky that they landed in la and not in a third world country or a ghetto the movie is written very simplistic why and why was this stupid barbie movie so much about our reality its dumb why wasnt there a happy ending where the barbies and the kens realize that nobone is better than the other and that they could share their power",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYo1WJyif1SDiBpuK_QY8zg,0.8925,positive,True
52219,@iansin7722,24/7/2023,18:43:47,6,"519 just my opinion but i think youre missing the point of the movie here to me the movie is trying to portray the barbies and maybe kens as programmed robots who have perfect materialistic things but lack independent thinking thats precisely the flaw in feminism and otherwise sexism that the movie is digging into  that if u blindly follow standards u dont get to live a life you call you own 

yes as a conservative leaning guy i do disagree with some messages like the whole you are enoughthing but i do feel that while the characters say it a lot in the film it doesnt seem like thats what the movie is trying to ultimately say by the end ken learns that he shouldnt overly rely on barbies validation and barbie learns to leave being a programmed toy to go out and discover life and death and all its nuances on her own the ending message moved past her wanting to be a perfect stereotypical barbie and explored her gaining agency in choosing to become a human in the end is she enough is she ready for that world we dont know but she has the resilience for it same with goslings ken while some of his other kens are still finding happiness with stereotypical guy stuff he needs to build his own country and not just rob someone elses house 

in the end i thoroughly enjoyed the movie not just coz it was hilarious but also because it was very poetic and smart in the way it portrayed its ideas i may not agree with everything but i certainly appreciated the  nuances about this gender war that we all view too simplistically imo everyone has their struggles and everyone needs to garner their own strength and work to overcome challenges the kens didnt take over barbie land by complaining they ganged up to get it likewise the barbies didnt get it back by talking nonsense they played smartly to their strengths and their opponents weaknesses and in the end robbie and gosling learned to live their own lives while looking out for each other thats empowerment",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCozRqj6bfVyi9Rx2_tnFbRw,0.9867,positive,True

this success is a monument to their stupidity they couldve just adaped this strategy long ago

i am extremely happy for the people who actually like it because it might mean that the corporations will stop shoving their ideas down our throats and start making their own movies for the audience who actually appreciates it imagine  can you imagine it  

they will leave male ips alone and start finally putting their messages into female dominated ips

why are you preaching female empowerment to men  girls wont feel impowered if they dont watch the shit dumbass

52345,@percimis,24/7/2023,16:31:59,1,"hi let me explain with barbie is feministfemale dominated whereas the kens are not this is coming from an opinion of a person who has followed the franchise since he was a child

the reason why barbieland is female dominated is because it is an imagined world meaning its inside the head of little girls therefore they are going to be all about women and wanting to be this and that this has been told at repeatedly that the barbies are just ideas so if you saw that they are mean to the kens and manipulates them then you are right children are mean to the kens his role has always been just a boyfriend 

so when both barbie and ken went out to the real world they broke their supposed roles where ken wanted to be more and barbie wanted to be just barbie which is why ken had all these horse and other stuffs and that they are able to cry a phenomenon that isnt supposed to happen

by the end of the movie the kens have started to gain more roles but if you are questioning why their roles has been lower than the barbies its because they have not have more roles in the real world its a slow change for them i know rhis bc i saw one kid at the store who only wants barbie and not ken bc hes ugly

sure there are feminism in here but thats the whole point its as if the barbies are mostly played with girls who wants girls to rule with a subtle hint that its is a reverse patriarchy

it went to back to how it used to be bc thats how its supposed to be barbies audience has always been mostly girls thus why girls get the bigger cut bc children project themselves into the dolls but bc of the modern times the kens started to gain more roles hence why it ended like that change is invetable and so will be the kens

like i said in my other comment im pretty sure this movie initially was what it was marketed as and somewhere along the way multiple rewrites changed it to this messy and nasty bit of work 

as the drinker notes the movie isnt sending the messages it thinks it is with how ken is treated and his motivations are set up his villain arc makes sense in taht you understand why hed want what hes doing but it doesnt make sense in how he succeeds as well as he does nor why the solution would be what it is the setup is for see how you like it men sympathy for ken being what 4th wave feminism would claim women are irl  despite the movie clearly understanding it cant quite get away with showing women irl being treated that way and have anyone buy it the setup for his villain arc felt like it was less a villain arc and more an extreme pendulumswing  which is what it was  where the kens take the barbies places and the barbies are now in the ken roles of being ornaments a message of meet in the middle seems the obvious payoff

52681,@segevstormlord3713,24/7/2023,11:34:29,76,"one of the weird things about it is that i feel like the antiman message was added in with a rewrite somewhere halfway through production i say that because the set up for it in the first act actually looks like the plan is to have ken be part of the female empowerment message by inversion of the sexes ken is set up as a sympathetic figure pathetic in the same way that your usual female empowerment protagonist is in the opening act of a movie where shes shown as being put down put upon and yearning to have a place in the world without consciously understanding that the patriarchy is whats keeping her down ken is that character in the opening act and you feel for him 

theres almost a message  probably unintentional and entirely missed by the final crew of screenwriters directors and producers  that a femalerun fantasy world still has problems and since the world of barbieville is presented as being at least as shallow as barbies plastic pool that she can walk on without getting her high heels wet the heavy liberal fantasy vibe of the empowered women who are aping the real world in a childish fashion which is fine mind this is about barbies and showing lawyer barbie presenting a childish version of a leftist fantasy argument before the supreme court is only off because the poor kid presenting it is clearly fantasizing about her liberal parents ranting over a case she absolutely does not understand all of this unintentionally paints the entire feminist leftist liberal mindset as being a childish one thats not the message they think theyre sending nor intend you to take away but its there

but during the realworld arc and i do have to say that everything about mattel and its presentation as a villain is hilarious so kudos to the humor writing i even chuckled at jokes i politically disagreed with they somehow decided that ken had to both be a mastermind who could carry a fullon revolutionary villain arc and still be an emotionally and mentally crippled manchild you still wince in sympathy at the way barbie treats him all the way up through the point he goes back to barbieland without her but youre clearly supposed to see all the warning signs that hes going to do something stupid maybe even villainous 

when barbie gets back and sees that hes somehow turned barbieland into the most ludicrous pastiche of what leftist feminists think the patriarchy is its cringy because its so unexplained and just plain manbashing everything is portrayed as being bad because er the kens are doing it never mind that its no less shallow nor impossible than what the barbies were doing its justdumb how did the kens brainwash the barbies into being bimbo girlfriends hanging on their every word i dunno story never tells us but it sure shows that ranting about how hard it is to be a woman in the modern world  im sorry under the patriarchy  snaps em out of itfor some reason even though barbies natural state in barbieville didnt experience having it hard in that fashion at all everything was shallowly trivially easy for them to just exist as strong women even though more than half the things in the rant are imposed on women by the expectations of 4thwave feminism not any patriarchy 

the tragedy is that what we saw in the trailers probably was more of what the movie was earlier on i can see the lighthearted family romp with the general feelgood women empowerment and discover that being a strong woman doesnt mean you have to give up on being a woman message it was there somewhere and then somebody rewrote it and ripped it apart shoved 3 other messages they couldnt handle the writing of in and botched the movie with a hefty dose of manhate",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfewHQQCA3RwZzjJK8V8u1g,-0.7733,negative,True

and even after that all that barbieland is presented to be fake and mostly filled with shallow characters as our protagonist barbie realizes so after realizing that she cant go on living there anymore and has to move to the real world because shes evolved past all that shallowness by gaining a wider perspective on the world and more complex emotions than a simple doll in part thanks to empathizing with ken and his struggles

i thought the whole 2001 scene was about barbie being the doll that all girls will want little girls used to play with those older kind of dolls but once barbie came out it was like it was the only one to get hence why the girls were i awe of the doll and smashed their old primitive onespretty obvious if you dont have an agenda to spin

it wasnt about man hating either it was about showing how men treat women by reversing the roles and having the women treat men the same way the women do all the jobs and have all the powertreat men like they are just fun to look at very superficially so if you think the women treated the men badly then why should women be thought of like this by men its meant to make you think how men treat women obviously

the movie covered both good and bad aspects of the doll and society and the maker of the movie said she wanted to make girls realise they are good enough you dont have to look like barbie

you didnt cover what happened at the end either that barbie is made real and starts living in the real world but chooses not to live with ken because she is only just becoming aware of who she is and wants to decide for herself what she cares about etcand they left barbieland a matriarchy at the end because they said until the real world becomes about equality then barbieland will stay like this meaning when the real world does barbieland will too not before

so understanding all this means the only thing you can criticise is the fact that the real world is not like that portrayed in the movie so the matriarchy is much worse than the real world its debated if the west is a patriarchy or not since we are not like the muslim middle east at all which are the only countries i would definitely call an example of a true patriarchy maybe some others so thats an extreme view to have and would be pure propaganda 

also equality does not mean we all have 5050 in all jobs it means equal opportunity so this doesnt take into account the fact that men and women choose different kinds of jobs and hoursbecause we arent identical which means we shouldnt be paid the same eitherbut commensurately based on our merit gender has nothing to do with how much you get paid

i think it was actually aware of its own explicit manhating and the end was meant to rectify that

barbie world was supposed to be a mirror image of the real world in terms of the power dynamic between men and women in a caricaturehyperbole form on either side

with that in mind the kens taking over is actually the genderswapped version of modern feminism and how its basically turned into a gender supremacy movement with incessant infighting ken discovering patriarchy was the mirror of a woman discovering feminism

i believe the message in the end was to say that the feministslgbtliberals should stop the infighting and take a step back and realize that theyre on the same team just like the kens did and from there they can start to build equality in a steady and measured way that everyone can acclimate to one step at a time instead of getting greedy and immediately demanding 5050 equity like modern feminism does

more evidence to this is the very centristcommon sense speech at the end where the human protagonist suggests a barbie which represent ideals should be made for women who just want to be normal or just want to be mothers because all of that is okay

then it takes a concerted effort of rebrainwashing by barbie and her new friends to revert everyone back to where they were at the beginning of the story they literally have to do a specific completely targeted message the each individual barbie to knock them back into the people they were before ken came back and told them about the real world and each rant is designed to make them angry and unhappy with the world at large to spur them into action if that doesnt scream that feminism is pure propaganda meant to make political voting blocks i dont know what would

it also honestly shows how blatantly segregated a world run by women would be they forcefully ignore things that make them feel uncomfortable midge and weird barbie blatantly talk horribly about each other to their faces and behind their backs they treat those they deem lesser than them as second class citizens they use men for emotional fulfilment while providing nothing of a reciprocal relationship

this movie is not for you i guess i didnt think it was a movie against men but its more like its for women i came out of that theatre feeling understood and less alone all the while i didnt feel like i hated or resented men 

many people are mad that the barbies rule everything i dont feel like i have to point out that its a fantasy movie so obviously its just an idea my male cousin immediately told me that barbieland would never be true that girls cannot all be doctors or presidents or astronauts and i know that but saying that women cannot be everything immediately tells them to stop reaching for the stars there have been movies where men were allowed to be superheroes and saviors and every profession known to mankind and they are rarely told that they cant be this such thing why not let the women dream a little bit even if its just in a movie about dolls

id understand why some men would roll their eyes at the preachiness especially with that monologue but as a woman i didnt find it obnoxious because well i related to it and there was some truth to it i dont blame the men for not understanding the movie the same way we women do i just hope they just dont hate on this movie out of spite it wasnt even that bad yall i didnt see it as a men bad women good thing i understood that ken was undergoing a major identity crisis and felt unappreciated he was a problem to be solved not a villain to be slain 

overall i think it says a lot with how so many women connected to this movie while i see a lot of men antagonize and fight it everything america ferrera said in that monologue was true by the way but men probably have never experienced it which is why their first instinct is to roll their eyes at the influx of political jabber i dont expect them to understand or to immediately jump on the feminism train but if i could empathize with ken then it wouldnt hurt if they atleast tried to be kind to the movie we all grew up with different gendered experiences so we are bound to perceive this movie differently but this movie made me happy as a woman and it didnt make me feel like making men subservient to me lmao yall dont have to worry about it so much",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpEujSqWYHAuzCHNdmqN8JQ,0.879,positive,True

53241,@justanotherhappyhumanist8832,24/7/2023,0:47:07,8,"you completely missed the point of the movie though i would be the first to call out a movie that puts men down because i cant stand that misandrist crap that is so abundant these days 

however the point of this movie wasnt how horrible men are just how hard the real world can be for women all the board members of mattel in the movie are men theyre all good guys and theyre all the ones who are really in charge of barbieland  the barbies and the kens included theyre the ones who created it and theyre the ones who created the perfect world for barbie so the film isnt actually saying that women should be in charge and that men should be second class citizens its not a movie meant to denigrate men youre meant to think of the mattel board members as the men who are actually running society but who care about women and who care about helping to create a society that benefits women and girls too the kens represent the opposite they are the ones who do nothing for society but feel entitled to women and power nonetheless the kens feel entitled to the barbies affections even though those affections are not reciprocated and that is made very clear by the barbies on multiple occasions in both barbieland and in the real world ken goes around demanding to be shown respect simply because hes a man he wants to be a lifeguard but doesnt want to have to save anyone he wants to be a doctor but doesnt want to study for a degree he wants a job but doesnt want to work all he wants to do is hang out on the beach and have cool stuff and hang with the bros but then he gets bitter and angry when he doesnt get everything that he wants including barbies affections meanwhile the mattel guys are literally running the world they could destroy all the barbies and kens in an instant if they wanted to they are hard workers theyre great guys and guess what they are literally all men every single member of the board at mattel is a man 

having heard that this was a feminist movie i thought that that would change by the end and that a woman would get promoted or something especially because there is a subplot about a mom who is an amazing barbie designer at mattel but that doesnt happen the men stay in charge they stay good people they stay on barbies side and the movie never ever even hints at that being a bad thing  because they are good at what they do they are good at running the world and they have their hearts in the right place and care about whats best for women and girls

the film is literally showing that having men in charge  even having only men in charge  can be absolutely amazing including for women so the film isnt saying that the problem is 50 of the population like this video say its not saying that the problem is all men the problem is just the kens who in this film are standins for incels men who idolise women but view us as objects to acquire like a new hat or a new book box or a new pair of cowboy boots  rather than appreciating us for our minds the kens want the barbies but theyre not actually interested in the barbies when they finally do score a date with the barbies all the kens do is play guitar and sing the same song to them for four hours they dont actually try to get to know them or anything and when they bring the patriarchy to barbieland they brainwash the women to become emptyheaded versions of themselves who cater to the kens every whim meanwhile the men who run mattel appreciate the barbies just the way they are

so the film isnt hating men at all  if anything its celebrating them  showing little girls and boys who maybe have seen some of the misandrist films of late that having a government or company made up entirely of men isnt necessarily a bad thing as long as they are good people  and the mattel guys are good people conversely when the kens try to set up their own government everything goes wrong because unlike the good men  the men who run mattel who are actually in control of everything worked hard to get where they are and care more about doing the right thing than money  the kens are disorganised lazy unprepared unscrupulous selfobsessed incompetent  and only think that they deserve their positions because they are men 

sound familiar it should the kens arent a metaphor for all men theyre a metaphor for incels  you know that worryingly large subsection of hypocritical male society who hate and dehumanise women who view women as objects and feel entitled to our affections and bodies despite doing nothing whatsoever to deserve them who hate other men who have what they want an example of this in the film is when all the kens fight each other in a final battle when they get jealous of theirbarbies talking to other kens and who think that society has dealt them an unfair hand and owes them everything even though theyve done nothing to help themselves improve and have given absolutely nothing back to society except their own selfishness and uselessness again you see this in the movie when ken complains about being barbies sidekick and how the world is stacked unfairly against him barbie points out that he needs to figure out who he is for himself instead of doing nothing and then being angry at society for not giving him a good enough role

nevertheless in spite of the kens destroying barbieland brainwashing the barbies to be their coquettish slaves a nod to the literal incel idea that each incel deserves to be assigned a beautiful woman as his personal property despite him destroying everything that the barbies spent years working to build  at the end of the movie barbie still tells ken that she should have made more time for him and should have tried to understand him and consider his feelings more these arent exactly the kind of feelings of extreme empathy that expect to see being afforded towards incels in a manhatingmovie like the one described in your video

so forget about the manhating ive been a subscriber of yours for years but you missed the mark completely with this one this movie is extremely generous in spirit towards men  even the worst of the worst i mean it literally shows men  and only men  running the world it simply juxtaposes them against the lowest dregs of male society to add even more context and nuance while simultaneously making some extremely heartwrenching accurately statements on what its like to be a woman in the modern world and all that combined with beautiful cinematography directing good writing and more metaphorical throwbacks and easter eggs for movie buffs than i could count

i went in expecting this movie to be antimen but what i found was legitimately one of the best written and directed films i have ever seen part of me cringes saying that and of course i know that it was originally conceived as a movie to sell dolls but given what greta had to work with she has truly created a masterpiece

this film isnt a misandrist diatribe against men its a beautiful piece of art that celebrates women and men  it just happens to juxtapose the bottoms of rungs of societies men against those who deserve to be at the top in order to show why some men deserve positions of power while others do not

but what makes me especially sad is that in your eagerness to find misandry where it didnt exist you missed the very real messages that this movie was trying to convey about what it is like to live as a woman day to day and no just because this movie talks about how being a woman can be hard that doesnt mean that being a man isnt hard too of course it is but there are many movies that list reasons why being a man in the real world can be hard this movie just so happens to list reasons why being a woman is hard  and it was so succinct and accurate it literally floored me again i was expecting their listed reasons to be misandrist or at the very least cliched and overdone but the reasons listed were so very true that they spoke to me deep in my heart because i could feel that pain every single one of those reasons is something that i genuinely struggle with every single day and most other women i know do too  we just dont talk about it much and especially not to men you could have actually learned something about the opposite sex that you didnt know instead of coming away angry on not just this issue but every issue you completely missed hearing what the writer and director was saying because you were looking for a message that wasnt actually there

also just fyi  as for that guy slapping her butt in front of her boyfriendwell as a woman i hate to tell you but im afraid to say that things like that do happen and most women will have had several things like that happen to them  with their partners or male friends right their with them  several times throughout their lives dont make the mistake of thinking that greta gerwig was just making up an exaggerated thing for this movie this is something that actually happens and its not a rare circumstance either",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_ssAjNQTp1IplPpA6vb0A,0.9986,positive,True

the only thing i liked about this film is deep scenes with barbie and americas scenes where she showed what it means to be a mother and a woman of today and when she talked about just having an ordinary barbie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOB-Fqvw2fh_WaivFm-NAgQ,0.6369,positive,True

53448,@AndrewUdal,23/7/2023,22:11:39,3,"ok so i saw this film yesterday and i think this films going to be decisive depending on if you can actually understand the message properly or not now im not one for having something so hard core feminist which destroys men and i do agree there are moments in this film lets exclude the barbie world because basically everyone in that world is portrayed as stupid because everything is portrayed as fake the real world i feel didnt need to be so destructive of men to achieve a similar goal 

however

as expected what wasnt mentioned in this review was probably one of the most important things that happened at the end of the film which answers why everything is so whack 

so lets explain the two biggest points simply and quickly

1 the kens dont get the top roles straight away because this film is a reflection of the real world but gender reverse its basically saying that you cant just be given something you gotta earn it in this film the girls have the power and they clearly state that through time they will rise through the ranks so just because you are a ken doesnt mean you get to automatically become a high position to seem equal an issue the real world is facing with people getting jobs because they meet a certain progressive quota 

2 this is what im surprised wasnt mentioned in the review ruth the creator of barbie and the person who talks to barbie right and the end said that the patriarchy is made up this is legit what is said in other words its something that is made to negatively effect both men and women as a divisive construct that stereotypes both men and women and removes equality so the film throughout shows how patriarchy regardless of what gender destroys both sides this is what i feel is the difference between people who like it and those who dont because this is what answers the way everything else was created the point of this film is to target girls and to teach them to ignore a concept of a patriarchal society and furthermore ignore the pressures of trying to always aim high the point of this film is to show that it doesnt matter what gender rules then other there will always be decision the only way to solve things is to treat each other the same and to live as the person we want to be and not what others tell us to be sometimes being a mother is all that needs to be done and sometimes being a father is as well we shouldnt be defined by what others believe we should be doing no matter what gender we or they are",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqNiV2B-YeysLRwlCDFQhw,0.438,positive,True

not every movie is about the message do not forget it is a story for fantasy land where iconic dolls exist it is reflecting what barbie worlds is i guess if you look it from other point of view why the lego movie the chosen one is not a woman it is with less action and violence
i liked the movie and think it is summed up well at next short review barbie movie of 2023 is against stereotyping the doll to be ultrafeminine and have a certain body type the film carefully and playfully explores feminist gender equality and antipatriarchal topics
i do feel people are getting too much into the theme of that the message which turns out is not everywhere and even feminist are getting tired of
at the movie there are things which are above the others but it is for female doll common what it is expected tom cruse on other hand has an action and seems it is simple enough",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC351qwXznqrVn1pgq8uiodQ,0.7554,positive,True

it admits that u can only be a man if u have a p and u can only be a woman if u have a v
barbie tells ken that hes more than just what she thinks of him reefirming that men doesnt soley exist to just satify women 

i dunno i think ur wrong on this one drinker the movie was a masterful mockery on feminism and at the end of the day women are just as important as men because we are both the keys to reproduction i believe in traditional values men should die for their woman and protect them so long as the woman is doing her part in keeping her man happy and loving him men have some better qualities such as physical strength emotional control leadership and women have better qualities such as healing providing comfort mothering intellectual",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeLX8d9ovEFDIuBMpLxMxDg,0.9834,positive,True

53897,@jjjjohnn121,23/7/2023,17:30:49,111,"it portrays an idyllic world where men are a caste lower which initially is understandable
it depicts a real world where caricatured sexism prevails and the forces of evil are represented in a fully male board of mattel the same company whose ceo for 30 years was in fact a woman who was responsible for creating the barbie doll despite this the movie suggests that barbie was from the start a tool of the evil patriarchy
ken is instantly fascinated by the exaggerated toxic masculinity which he eventually brings to barbie land
ultimately in barbie land good wins in the form that the status quo is restored where kens are again the plebeian caste
there isnt really a single competent and positive male character in the entire film and those that come close are feminized
the ultimate conclusion is more or less that men and women should live in isolation as they are fundamentally opposing factions
not for a second is there a suggestion that the answer is equal treatment of people regardless of gender

now imagine for a moment that in a world where the vast majority of homeless people suicide victims people performing the most dangerous jobs people compulsorily drafted to the front in times of war etc are women a movie is made in which the idyllic world is one where women are secondclass citizens are harmful to men in a caricatured way in the real world a matriarchal entirely female board of an evil corporation pursues the hero matriarchy begins to prevail in the idyllic world which is eventually defeated everything goes back to the patriarchal norm and the final lesson is that women should keep away from men would you have any thoughts on this i think you would and that without even having to identify with any gender",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMGB4PXCtGzNH1Vi-6yoRew,-0.9068,negative,True

it was both funny and refreshing to see a film about barbie openly criticise extreme feminism by making it into a ridiculous parody yet in a way that didnt feel malevolent or preachy it was a film by women for women that criticised feminism in a fun and selfaware way by painting it as a charicature alike the makebelief that children play the whole patriarchy gag and everything else was taken so far that it was clearly a meta commentary on the insanity of the men vs women debate the whole movie only showed ridicilulously idealist and childlike depictions of the world both in barbieland and in the real world everything was a caricature first and foremost a charicature of feminism itself and that was definitely intentional

what i loved most about the film was how it had this consistent feeling of look at us is this really how ridiculous our views are yes there are issues in the world but so what life is still worth living and we dont have to be so serious all the time we can have fun play even with barbies and have a laugh at ourselves after so many postmodern nihilistic films about how shit and meaningless everything can feel it was great to watch a film that made fun of an issue that people get so uptight about especially because it was selfparody by people like margot robbie who i assume to consider herself a feminist

i gotta admit that the world seems so ridiculous sometimes that its hard to distinguish parody from serious messaging but nonetheless the fact that some people seem to take the surface level depiction of this film as the main message worries me if that is the level of sophistication we have theres little hope for any sensible conversation",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAcE374sBaib1GAb2j3RYwA,0.9224,positive,True

and the uncomfortable reality is that mostly men are in power of a lot of the biggest companies google facebook and all those things everyone depends on that is not bad but it is just the reality of things the movie took a pretty ironic take on this because as expected people got offended for some reason whats the difference between a man or woman in charge anyways lol and im not saying women cant do those things and neither is the movie i think they showed it in a very softhearted way you all have to remember this movie is a comedy there are very fewserious scenes in this movie and just because theres some fancy men sitting in chairs doesnt mean they have to act all mature and smart for a pg13 comedy men acting funnystupid in a fictional comedy does not equal actual ideals on real men  they were mocking specific types of males this was pretty obvious to me guess not for yall lol  a lot of the characters equally act dumb not just the men get your head out of your ass",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyDQd7Jr6IoDw-S6KrGrmQ,0.2865,positive,True

it admits that in order to be a real woman you have to have a vagina and to be a man you have to have a penis 

the movie is mockery of feminism and suggests that if you want to have a world that is unrealistic and run by women then its a fantasy land like barbieland where women think they are in control but children are actually controlling their destiny 

the movie revolves around the concept that men run the real world which is true 

the movie also mocks youth who use terms like fascismto attack things and people they dont like 

ultimately the female protagonist of the film decides that she is happier living in the real world that is run by men 

barbie also tells ken that he is more than simply what a woman thinks he is it reaffirms that men dont exist solely for the sake of satisfying women that is an empowering and antisimp message for men

i dont think the kens in this movie are meant to represent all men kens represent men who are driven by lust power and reputation theyre constantly bragging about something or trying to impress other women in doing so they end up acting like douchebags trying to show women how to live what to like patronizing them on things they assume to know a lot about the kens are responsible for making little girls feel embarrased to be ladylike everything barbie represents 

if you remember there was this one dude named allen in the film who fought valiantly to protect barbie and the other two characters from the realworld the mom and daughter  cant rmb their names i think allen represents the honest man whos just trying to live a normal life without being oppressed into doing what the rest of society is doing hes got masculine traits but he doesnt adopt a toxic masculine approach to life hes not trying to impress anyone nor does he talk to women in a condescending manner like most of the kens do if you ask me allen represents most men are though some feminists might disagree especially the karen variants

overall from a neutral point of view watching it for myself i didnt get the impression that the movie was based on a dull feminist point of view of the world although it does favour the side of most women i mean its a barbie movie after all its made for girls the message is clear humans are scared filled with tons of imperfections no matter how perfect everything might seem and in the process we invent coping mechanisms like patriarchy feminism or adopt blue pillred pill approaches to life to process the world more easily 

the writers could have done a better job at making the message more clear although i highly doubt that the movie is an outright attack on most men its made for girls and women i dont think they have to apologize for making it the way it ended up there will be some who are offended by the film however its a step in the right direction with regard to opening a dialogue on feminism",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9fBs0pDDNlxhREyFqxS4rg,0.9773,positive,True

it broke my heart to see how much it meant to ken to just be asked the time asking someone the time is not confirming the dominance of their gender over yours it is just recognizing that they are a decently educated person that might know a minor current fact but it is treated as a something evil women should not have to ask men for the timesays this movie she probably asked him because he was the nearest adult and thus most likely to be able to help her at the time the fact that this small act meant so much to him really underlined the abuse that he lived under in barbieland 
second when they said the kens could only have very minor positions because that is how it is for women in the real world i leaned over and whispered there are several women on the supreme court right now i thought of speaker pelosi the many female ceos and board members there are  i guess this movie really wants to discount those achievements yep definitely only minor positions good heavens the movie even brings out ruth saying i am mattel and yet still maintains that women only hold very minor positions just awful 
i think what we are seeing here is that women have gained more equality which is great but at the same time this has caused them to realize they cant have it all and this makes them mad they think they should be able to have it all and thus the patriarchymust be hiding the key still from them well guess what  neither women nor men can have it all that is why we work well together  maybe the truth is that together as a unit we can have it all but not acting individually and alone

well she was right very much a female empowerment movie throughout and lots of jokes made around patriarchy i cant lie tho i still enjoyed the movie 
sometimes it did get really heavy on the feminism and i totally agree parents bringing their children have no idea what they signed for

im going to stick with the classic animated barbie films that treat the men with better respect and care than this hot neon pink garbage


edited im happy there is some resolve in the comment section but to those that didnt get my message my sister and i did watch it and need up with different view points of the film my sister loved it as she connected with barbie and the message so did i but how barbie apologized to ken was too short and quickly undermined with a joke of how much of a incel he was i aware that the ending is meant to be ironic flip of reality but is it too hard to ask for true equality this problem is no longer a women vs men issue made obvious by how the rich male ceos and the barbie empowered women still undermined the values of the lower classminoritybarbie didnt change anything but instead made everything the same with them getting a consciences i know that change is slow and grueling but that is what makes real activism important and great it would be nice is the film had passed the torch for equality to both women and men to share their positive traits rather than to flip a superficial reality cant i share my feminism values with men as they share their masculine values with me

the target audience of this movie was practically everyone barbie loversbarbie haters and with such extensive marketing to reach pretty much everyone was this all to spread propaganda of a women only ruled world or just to get you thinking what a waste of time 
sure the barbies have all these prestigious roles and whatever but its a doll it doesnt do jack shit and neither does ken or even the portrayed real world and i think the moments that made this all clear were barbies interactions with her original creator they were the only parts of the movie with nornal human interactions where barbie was isolated from this mad world and got to exchange real thoughts and feelings without any weird political messages her creator understood that all she was meant to be was a doll and she is just going with the flow stuck in a world where everyone seems to be a doll at most even that real world but ruth and barbie ironically seem to be the only true humans who had a heart to heart at the end where the message was forget about patriarchy fasicm oppression labels feminism roles expectations concepts terms politics a scene of people seemingly having fun with the simple joys of life plays during the second scene with ruth and gives the real message of this movie fuck everything you just saw no one won there and everyone just made a stereotypical fool of themselves be your own person not a living embodiment of coping mechanisms

but sometimes i am not sure about you and your viewers opinions nobody in the comments is like yeah feminism is important i just dont like how they handle that topic in modern cultureno mostly it feels like an allout rant against questions of diversity feminism etc i meancmon you know its important that we speak about these things right i live in germany and theres a lot metoo stuff going on women earn less money for the same job in over 80 percent of cases of domestic violence its against women dude when my girlfriend walks through berlin in a skirt its stalingrad just worse so no need to act like its nothing to talk about in present society but of course we can argue about how its implemented in media and of course theres a lot wrong

i remember an interview with you where you speak about how its wrong to just superimpose toxic male character traits on women protagonists but i never hear you complain about the classic terrible male character its just when its about women why why not talking about the thousands of disgusting male protagonists in movie history because it doesnt serve your audience also in that interview you said something about how ideological present hollywood isi mean come the f on its american cinema and it is always so hardcore ideological about how great the usa are and why you have to be the world police about values family marriage and that you have to love your country so they cand send you to some country that has oil and blow it up and whatever look at 1980s cinema that period in time was just a giant attempt of getting your dk hard again after losing it in vietnam since the 1960s what about those terrible john wayne western or that propaganda trash green berets  where hollywood was telling me about how awesome your nation is and how native americans were drawn as monsters and how they got what they deserved what about mccarthy and the governments impact on movies in the 1950s and how people where excluded because of the wrong opinions what about sickening films like american sniperor we were soldiers what about the hays code please dont act like your cinematic history wasnt always an instrument that helped stabilizing conservative nationalist agendas and ideologies",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOT5017E2kuN6vKXDZ1uww,-0.97,negative,True

that being said i agree and disagree with drinker here i mean i took the whole thing as a mockery of both feminist ideals especially towards the idea of the patriarchy and masculinity as well like when ken believes he can become a doctor just by saying im a man and then getting denied because he doesnt have an education those short scenes just highlight the ridiculousness of us living in a socalled patriarchal society or how the first real feminist we see is a teenage emo girl who hasnt yet experienced the real world but believes so fervently in an ideology
the film kept this going until the third act thats where they ruined everything but choosing a side you cant mock both sides but then backtrack and claim you support only one right after the mothers rant did i lose interest and respect for the film because then it just became a shallow mockery of men
like please explain to me how loving and expressing that love for the synder cut or the godfather is somehow only a masculine trait
then after the hocus pocus and they return to old barbieland without achieving meaningful change the film comes to the message i took it as you define who you are not a group or ideology and i appreciate that but it falls a little flat thanks to the third act
i think they missed the biggest opportunity they had by not making will ferrel the real antagonist everything would have been different if they took the angle of corporations only caring about the bottom line and not any political message and barbie and co realising this and convincing the kens to join them in defeating them but no in the end his character was completely useless and came to nothing but a few jokes remember kids corporations arent your friends

yes barbie has a lot of blatant feminism in it but i also think it criticises it in a way because i believe that the kens werent necessarily meant to represent men i think they represent women in a way let me explain to me the whole point of barbieland was to be basically an opposite of the real worldwhich i believe was also exaggerated for movie purposes as instead of being a male dominated world not saying its really patriarchy just more catered to have men in extremer positions which does also mean negative positions it is a matriarchy it feels almost like the time before women had the right to vote with kens  as women being seen as less then however when ken discovers the patriarchy it could be seen more as discovering feminism only the extreme modern version to me him bringing those ideas back is like the current extreme feminist movement in which they aim to almost completely reverse gender roles instead of having equality i think my theory is backed by scenes such as barbie telling ken its always girls night being turned around with ken doing the same to her 
i do think they should have made ken more serious and sympathetic so maybe my point doesnt really stand but i hope to at least get a discussion started in this more nuanced direction

men simply challenging themselves and having fun working out running companies riding horses etc is portrayed as scary symbols of patriarchy
barbies restore matriarchy by excluding the kens from voting in the election this is why people put ourbefore democracy because its not every bodys black barbie president outright taunts the kens that if theyre lucky one day theyll have a tiny amount of power in a low ranking institution
apparently you have a fragile inflated male ego of you dont like your wife or gf fooling around with other guys hence the barbies use this to start a brawl

its similar to how so many revolutions that topple dictators simply install another dictator or oligarchy which picks up where the dictator left off

barbies response is for her to not worry as ken is superfluousand then she giggles i think that says everything right there

but its one line in one short scene at the very end after weve been hit over the head for almost two hours about how horrendous all men are it goes by so fast i didnt even absorb it the first time i saw it

society was generalized in the movie i know that not every men is like that but the one guy literally walks up to barbie and slaps her in the as in the middle of a crowded boardwalk in broad daylight in front of her boyfriend352 does happen a lot it happened to a friend of mine when we were walking at a mall there are many men who does that and treat women as if they were an object 
and i know that nowadays a lot of women have really important jobs but it was not easy to them to get where they are and if we investigate about this subject we will be able to see that most of those important job positions are owned by men
i agree that the ending wasnt the best for me it should have been kens and barbies taking control it wouldve had a better message but at least barbies let kens have jobs just as in real life women try to get recognized and after all their hard work they are rewarded with very little opportunities

for the sake of this comment i am going to give you the benefit out the doubt and assume it is as bad as you have said
i think if the ending was different it could change the message a lot 

so everything i say here is taken from the video as i havent seen the movie so forgive any inaccuracy
ok here is how i think they could have done this better 

if the barbie world is sexist and imbalanced in favor of women and the real world is the same but in favor of men i think that could work as a hyperbolic representation of our real world and barbie being a parallel to that because in our world there is a lot of sexism and imbalance albeit not close to how extreme it sounds like the movie portrayed it 
so i think it could work if the barbie world was an exaggerated mirrored satire of our world and when barbie comes into the real world she discovers how it feels to be treated that way 
and in the end with both genders having an understanding of the repercussions and consequences of sexism and imbalance in power regardless of who is the victim they come together and make barbieland or whatever a truly equal and respectful utopia where neither gender is oppressed shamed or restricted from doing anything 

i think that is a message generally everyone that is sane can agree on nobody should have more power or opportunities because of their gender i think that could be portrayed in a productive positive way easy for all ages and demographics to understand i dont think political messages are an issue in media until it promotes something objectively bad like sexism",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK985GZPJYTrAxykjBRKRoA,0.9867,positive,True

this shows that barbie world is the fcked up world as ken thought the real world was so bad because of his experience in the barbie world they go back and the kens take over and rule everything like in the real world but this isnt like the real world at all it is just the barbie world but kens rule now but they paint it as way worse than when the barbies ruled it ends with kens losing power again but not every night is barbie night so kens get a very small concession this is shown as the ideal great thinks the ideal world would be one ruled by women and men are subservient slaves and men get one day off per week

i view that as sort of a selfaware critique but of feminism my partner went with me and she flat out said that unprompted once she did it changed my outlook on the movie she also said it was fucked up that originally the kens had nowhere to go and the movie went out of their way to show that it was fucked up by the movies end the menkens started having more of a stake in the society too trying to imply look its fine to not have equal outcomes that rails directly against modern hollywoods messaging

overall i think the movie wasnt as antimen as youre making it out to be on the surface yeah its antimen but deeper down theres another layer of interpretation that says feminism wth are you doing dont you get how screwed up this is that youre casting out half the population and dont care about them at all

the fall of afghanistan to the taliban represents a good example of what happens when there is disordered relationships between men and women  society becomes unstable and vulnerable  when the taliban took over the main losers appear to have been women because they lost their freedoms to go to work and school  however it is important to point out that to the best of my knowledge there was no example of women being willing to take up arms to protect their rights against the taliban  the women just let the taliban take right over  from what i can tell the majority of men in afghanistan really did not perceive have anything to loose from having the taliban take over  i read that many men were actually excited to have the taliban take over because they thought it improved their chances to get married  so from the male perspective there was no inentive to fight the taliban  if there is one thing we learned from afganistan one major difference between men and women is that men are significantly more  willing to engage in war when it suits their needs  women in afganistan were not willing to fight even when it greatly served their interests  so this illustrates that women do need to cultivate good relationships with men and vice versa to provide men an incentive to be willing to fight for the protection of society  a society that does not adequately address the needs of men will be vulnerable to collapse by outside forces  
i have not seen my barbie movie but my understanding is that the plot involves ken decides he is being oppressed by a matriarchy so he imposes an oppresive patriarchy on the barbie world  from reading reports on what men thought about the malefemale relationships had seriously degraded in afghanistan on account of the wokewestern cultural values brought to afghanistan  same thing happened to ken  the difference is that in the real world the taliban is still in charge in afghanistan",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC14OkD3VZKTVwXf1ivGUVng,-0.8254,negative,True

you missed the smile comment as well  im sure it wasnt meant to be a clapback about captain marvel they seem particularly salty about that one 

the butt slap also makes no sense because theres multiple other women around in that scene and the guy isnt doing the same to them its just something put in there to check off a checklist without making a lick of sense also why would the misogyny only be directed only at her when even other women in the scene laughs at her its not misogyny its people making fun of two weird looking characters that looks wildly out of place  the writing is nonsensical and absurd  why have an election when you have taken over something moreover how can the barbies and kens know things about the real world when none of them have ever been there  how the hell do you get a writer that is so incompetent at his job that the audience literally gets the opposite of everything that is being intended working on a project of that size and budget dont studios or production companies screen people based on merit or success anymore  

i mean you could also point to the obvious transphobic racist and antigay messaging of the movie apparently all the barbies are women with the exception of the trans barbie but theres no trans equivalent for the men theres several minority kens who form part of the misogynist uprising and who needs to be put in their place by never ascending to any kind of meaningful political power and its obvious from all the jokes that its implied that the kens or at least some of them are gay  the movie isnt very subtle about its sexual innuendo in a kids movie also the males having to separate from the females in an environment where they were all previously together is gender exclusivediscriminatory safe spaces by the terminology of some on top of that the movie is also implying that the person in the real world that played with her has no idea how a democracy works or what a fascist isits also telling that they chose a minority actress to be their standin for what is essentially an ideology from some white western women but then again having a minority shield against trash tier content criticism is nothing new in 2023 and i dont even have to highlight that they made several character politically ignorant and stereotypically foolish but hollywood has got to get those stereotypes in there somehow several actresses plays in this that has played other equally spiteful and vindictive movies aimed towards men so im also starting to see a pattern emerging

his main critique of the film is that men are treated like dogshit where women are not in fact women in barbie world are dominant and literally run everything that isnt ok in the real world i would agree 100 but were not talking about the real world were talking about barbie world 

barbie world is not an allegory of the real world its a matriarchal fiction a female dominated toy brand just like jijoe for example was a male dominated toy brand within barbie world the male characters are just background characters that do nothing so it makes sense that male characters in barbie world do nothing

contrast this with star wars star wars is not a male or female dominated franchise it is in fact meant to be an allegory of the real world at least the original and prequel trilogies were this is why the ray character was so problematic because there is no room for a marry sue in the real world

but you cannot make this same argument for barbie its meant to be female dominated little girls are not going to buy male barbie dolls except only to be the boyfriends of their female dolls just like little boys are not going to buy female jijoes there isnt even an addendum  here there are no female jijoes outside of limited novelties and thats ok because its a male dominated brand

edit since writing this comment ive seen the movie and i still respectfully disagree with drinker i have to wonder if he even saw the whole film i think thats an issue with a lot of critics of barbie if you miss the last 10 minutes of the film you mist the whole point of the film

the first 45 of the film is when the barbies dominate barbie world the next 45 of the film is when the kens dominate and the last 10 of the film is everyone realizing how stupid matriarchy and patriarchy is and they resolve to make barbie world into an all inclusive society that works for both barbies and kens if you walked out of the theater before that last part youre going to think the film is stupid i certainly did at that point but i kept an open mind and gave the film a chance",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqipcGRQLRioOO96D08KAjg,-0.928,negative,True

57018,@LordThulhu,22/7/2023,23:47:37,1,"you know im glad that i never watch a movietv show before seeing reviews of it but this time i allowed myself to have a bit of hope the trailers made it look like a wacky but charming movie and i grew up with barbie in my life had the dreamhouse and loved the movies i was expecting something similar like enchanted and i was ready to like it but i should have known it is the current year after all and thus anything that has a female character in it probably sucks because apparently female characters arent allowed to be just characters they have to be as feminist as possible and there is nothing more toxic than feminism

i made myself a sandwich while watching this video and i came up with a much better story than this they should had started with barbie in dreamland going on some wacky adventures with ken and afterwards they go home to their dreamhouse like its normal because for anyone in dreamland it is everyday is a new exciting adventure showing that this is all linked to a childs imagination the next day they both expect a new adventure but they seem to have trouble with coming up with ideas which confuses them and shows that this isnt really normal but luckily other barbies and kens come along and whisk them away on a adventure together making them forget that weird moment and shrugging it off as nothing it starts off great as normal but barbie falters and isnt as competent and confident as before ken tries to help and support her but he also struggles to top it all off the adventure scenario seems to only focus on the other barbie and ken while our barbie and ken just cant seem to really be part of it it ends very disappointingly for them though the others seem completely unaffected and even their dreamhouse seems to change its no longer this vibrant pink as the others and cracks are popping up everywhere the atmosphere is very gloomy and there seem to be a distance between the previously happy couple maybe even make it that they cant feel each others touch anymore or have them literally unable to touch each other 

now barbie is extremely worried and ken is depressed about the situation they talk about it and together they come to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with their child maybe have them call the children that play them their gods or something more creative wanting know what is wrong so that they can fix it they go to the real world maybe with some magic or a portal or something there you can have some of there you can have some of the wacky antics from the trailer or maybe have them imminently pop up in the childs room and then the wacky stuff from the trailers where the poor child tries to keep things under control maybe the child is distressed because she is growing up and while all her friends seemed to have their future figured out she panics over the fact that she doesnt have a clear goal in mind maybe it was a schoolassignment that made her realize that or maybe her parents putting too much pressure onto her or maybe something else maybe the relationship with barbie and ken is falling apart because the boy she had a crush on and projected onto ken is dating or just crushing on another girl typical things we all stressed over when we grew up barbie and ken try to help her in the typical barbie until we get to the emotional climax maybe their ways of doing things dont work in the real world or whatever but in the end they managed to help the girl either figuring out what she wants and getting over her crush projecting the ideal partner onto ken and it would be funny if nothing really changed about ken because she never really knew the boy she had a crush on and thus was projecting a fantasy idea of the boy onto ken anyway and barbie starts to maybe not be as versatile in her skills as before but for that she is very good at the one thing she does and very confident as well or have the message that it is fine for her to not know what she wants to do and that she should keep an open mind until it finally just clicks that even adults struggle with that and simply not something you can force either figure it out or you simply dont its as simple as that

barbie and ken go back into dreamland and they go another wacky adventure until we return one last time time in the real world showing the little girl happily playing with her friends and their beloved barbie dolls the end

1 highlight the traditional role and position of women in society and how garbage it is they are the women of their world easily blown off existing only in relation to their barbie expected to be attractive and complacent 

2 show the current displacement modern men are feeling in an increasingly womencentric world they have lost their main identities purpose and roles as providersincharge and romantic partners and are painfully aware that the women they desperately want to like them do not need them and are fine being alone like the kens modern young men are drawn to the idea of patriarchy as a way to regain respect but dont actually like it once they figure out what is actually involved just like ken they do not fit the old way but have not found their new place and identity yet 

on the whole i thought the treatment of the male characters was quite sensitive the kens are not portrayed as evil misogynistic villains their primary motivations are their desire to matter feel loved and have their persons and interests be respected the allmale board of mattel is likely treated with nuance they could have been portrayed as some secretive male cabal trying to use barbie to brainwash little girls but instead these men are genuine fans of barbie and want barbie to succeed 

while the ending is a bit of a clunky stumble for the movie barbie has spent the entire film wanting to get back to barbie land perfection so her sudden desire to become human makes no sense it cannot end with the unification of barbies and kens in a perfect gender utopia the real world is still messed up and barbie land must remain an allgirl sacred space and safe haven",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNtQsDh1LdaV_BnxcbrtE1w,0.9902,positive,True

 no where in the movie is motherhood demonized in the beginning of the movie the sequence of the little girls abandoning their baby dolls for barbies and the discontinuation of midge the pregnant barbie is to show that girls dont have to be mothers that they can aspire to be more however this does not demonize motherhood in anyway shape or form in fact i believe the concept of motherhood girlhood and sisterhood is some of the most profound themes in the movie examples of this are for instance that the two real world characters are a mother daughter duo and america feirra the mother in the duo literally has a whole speech at the end of the movie of how girls should be able to aspire to be mothers have careers have one or both one of the most impactful scenes of the movie is when billie eilishs song plays and there are clips of women and girls mothers and daughters experiencing girlhood in all its authenticity the idea that mother hood is demonized in this movie is so wrong and archaic

 in terms of the whole anti men sentiment of this movie i dont believe that is the case either in our world we live in a patriarchy however women can assume roles of power this is great however the playing field amongst men and women is not equal for example we have yet to have a women president in our real world men are mostly in power however women can assume power too just not on the same scale this is reflected in barbie land except reversed at first yes the barbie land does not give the kens any rights however by the end of the movie they revise this and issa raes character literally says well give kens the same amount of power women have in the real worldmeaning they will have some but not as much as the barbies in both worlds the power is 6040 whos in power varies and if men get to have the real world a place we all actually live in why is it such an issue for women to have the barbie world at the very least because yes ideally both worlds would be 100 equal between men and women but the real world isnt even like that so why would barbie land be

i hope you can remember that barbies demographic is young women and girls this is our world where its easy to assume power at any whim bc in the real world thats obviously not the case",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MdBx7YtqRPlVJcGxCNB9Q,0.9256,positive,True

barbie clearly has an agenda but due to incompetent writing and just shoehorning what the writer feels and wants without any nuance or tact just makes the conclusion that they got to in the end look stupid i also hate how in the end it was just fine to accept that its either a patriarchy or matriarchy and because women are viewed as 2nd rate citizens in the real world that in barbie land it is right for kens to stay 2nd rate citizens

and men who get upset about the movie is weird its making fun of man boys not men and in general man boys should be made fun of 

when the men get jealous and try to sit on leather couches and fight with each other over the possession of women who arent theres i hate to tell you but go to a bar see what happens when a guy buys a drink for a gal and she talks to someone else you end up fist fighting over a girl neither of you are sleeping with again man boys 

so do the monologues need to be there no they are awful truly awful 

but two things save this movie when barbie decides her path she sees a woman and women playing with children and women raising those children and having lives 

its not her climbing mountains or tackling bulls or traveling through and saving weak men nah its her playing with children 

and she decides to become human to have that life 

and the best saving grace the creator of the movie appears twice and in the end she comes along and says all this patriarchy feminism all this is bullshit humans do it because their mortal and cant handle the fact that theyre going to die so they invent all this horse crap to make themselves seem forever to handle their mortality but its all bull pucky

they even put a joke where barbie called herself an example of not being perfect and then the narrator saying note to director margot robbie was the worst person to pick for this  because haha shes perfect and all the women in the theater laughed  this is the female mentality in action

once the realworld chads from the land of patriarchy come in the barbies are actually unironically happy  they say how relaxing and great it is to obey men
the womenbarbies who feel ugly introduce them to feminism because they hate seeing them happy because of something they disagree on and they destroy a functioning society where the men are happy and had houses",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClxiJpvefiR7ltFQYnoVATw,0.9919,positive,True

and what do you know shocker of shockers hollywood made a political message out of the one toy that feminists have made the posterchild for hatred against men screaming that she represents mans perfect woman and railing against her for well reasons only extremists would ever think was real feminists have hated barbie since barbie was created calling her superficial and an unreasonable expectation that was leveled against all women to strive for and whats really stupid is that this opinion has been held by feminists even unto today when barbie has been made with every body shape every hair color every positive image that mattel could come up with to appease these idiots 

whats really insane is that barbie could have been any body shape any hair color and she still would have ended up as a role model for young girls and feminists would still have hated her and for a lot of reasons that would take a college dissertation to cover rather than a youtube comment barbie is an excuse and feminists made her a symbol the vast vast vast majority of young girls who looked at their barbie dolls never thought gee if only i could look and act just like her in fact those that did were almost always grown women who had very deep psychological issues and certainly dont represent women as a whole no it was jealous women who considered themselves ugly because the high school captain of the football team turned them down and rather than look deeper and learn to love themselves for who they are they chose to hate everyone who didnt cater to them ridiculous

if feminists had taken a second to realize the truth of the matter they would have understood that the whole blonde perfect figure vapid idiot image they thought barbie was supposed to emulate didnt actually originate from barbie it came from wait for it another shocker of shocker moments hollywood for decades hollywood primarily cast women with blonde hair and perfect figures made their characters vapid idiots and set them up as the perfect woman for men in actuality it was only the perfect woman for certain hollywood moguls and hollywood was the true guilty party 

yeah feminist hollywood youre railing against your very own creation way to go geniuses but it was so much easier to just point at a popular figure that young girls played with and use that as an excuse to popularize hatred against men simple explanations for singleminded misandrists why look deeper and try to find out the truth when easy blaming is so much easier

thinking more about what this really is i came up with a new even more sinister hypothesis for why mattel wanted to make this its not feminist propaganda its corporate propaganda think about barbie while there was always a theme of feminine empowerment starting at a time when that was quite radical now its a message struggling for relevance really it was always about consumerism both the barbie toys themselves and their focus on accessories clothes fashion etc in the most extreme view could see its rejecting of motherhood as dont be a mother instead work earn and spend money on crap like a good little capitalist in this day and age thinking of feminism as well as things like race transqueer liberation and so on almost all my friends my age upper 20s who are female trans queer nonwhite and so on might talk some of the struggles of those things but the vast majority of their daytoday struggles is overwork and not earning a living wage even for those in professional careers just as it is for a lot of white men these days blaming all problems on men being men is a good way to distract people from these actual issues to divide and conquer women blame their problem on the patriarchy while men  driven towards the altright  blame their problems on feminism affirmative action immigrants replacement theory whatever else the altright tending to put bigbusinessfriendly politicians in office as well distract everyone  all of whom are being screwed  from the real problem and culprit this movie having mattel in the end being part of the solution and the end resolution being the resurrection of the still sexist matriarchy in barbieland rather than some sort of cooperation cant have that because maybe theyll then see the real problem got to keep people at war with each other feels like a great demonstration of this but because criticizing any of this movie is misogynist people stay blind perhaps the writerdirector of this movie actually was a bitter antiman person though i get the sense any real feminists wouldnt be in favor of this movies sexist resolution either but the funding and corporate backing was even more sinister",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8z9LujtjlDzTun2oX8spA,-0.9948,negative,True

i am insulted it is a disrespect to cinema
it infuriates me how much pol these days r so obsessed w social media ideologies and memes and etc to the point that theyre willing to watch a full movie only to completly miss what the movie was actually made for and then daring to blame the movie for being something that its exactly against it is disgusting to me
its like saying that beauty and the beast is a movie about jugding people by their appearence and calling it a superficial garbage
it is exactly the same thing
ppl arent willing to take the time to actually understand and analyse a modern movie with their own brains no society made us tired of wokeness so now less just leave the analysing part to social media
you dont have to be a smartass to understand that this movie is a satirycal comedy which means every polotical subject that its gonna contain explicitly in will be a subject that the movie is critiquing
its not that hard u just have to use ur own brain and analyse it with ur own opinion regarlessly of what social media reports say its that simple

the fact that some ppl r watching barbie untill the end and cant understand that its a movie that uses both feminism and patriarchy to mock it while the movie is more than explicit abt it genuenly blow my mind it actually makes me feel quiet hopeless tbh it males me feel like us humans in general are becoming the most dumbass beings on earth bc of having everything too easy for us
its insanely frostrating how some ppl just cannot appreciate good cinema just bc of the times its being made aka barbie
and yk what i hope this movie makes a whole lotta money i hope pll who watched it amd liked it will rewatch it countless times i for sure will and i hope it gets tons of oscar noms and wins majority of them
maybe it could make some ppl actually give it try and use their braincells without social media influence
i actually expected ppl to finally stop being pessimistic abt cinema with this movie that they would actually see how good cinema still exists and how amazing it is but no what was i thinking silly me agreeing with social media moovements is more important if this continues going on one day cinema will end completely and were gonna look back at this time and see all the amazing movies we decided to shit on just for the sake of it like this one and well say well those were actually pretty good movies those actually made some history but it will be too late bc we didnt enjoy the last good movies while we still had them why bc social media created a trend movement against post covid movies

1 they showed how in barbie land the women were in charge in everything while ken is just ken who poured his life to love barbie while in real world barbie and ken found that here men were in charge so i took a conclusion that they showed us that woman in real world is like ken in barbie land 
2 ken learned about patriarchy and he started to think that he could be more he could get his own home he could be someone who was in charge wasnt this like how women learned that she could be more than just mans wife that women could be more could lead could be everything
3 when ken overcomed barbie land its too much right all the feminists hate it if that happens right feminist hate it if ken overcome everything hate it when they are led by ken but ken is woman in real world that makes the feminist hate themselves
4 barbie did everything to take back their houses their nice and fantastic day which were all about them there was no way ken took it but the movie showed that barbie in barbie land is like men in real world so the feminist who watched it and like yes you go barbies throw all kens off is like saying to women who find path to lead the world get out
5 in the end they took conclusion that barbie needed to share with ken ken could be more than just ken so barbie started to give position to ken but from bottom then they said something like this someday maybe you can see ken become leader like maybe woman in real world too
its not new in real world in the past men were always in charge but then woman started to get position yes from the bottom like ken but now you can see there are women who are leaders women who are doctor woman who are astronauts someday ken can too right
6 they are against mother no in the end of movie they listed to the mother who gave idea to make normal barbie that is no need to have fantastic profession because maybe the barbie just wants to be a mother or housewife and thats okay 

so for me you can see this as feminist movie although its a century late but ken is the feminist icon not barbie because barbie in the movie is how feminist describes patriarchy",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn6RJzaKGIvziUkwSdNo9zA,0.9655,positive,True

appabend just notes the comedy of how they shot themselves in the foot in a power attempt to push the message it comes off like a deconstruction of modern feminism and how it leads women to becoming bitter and pessimistic while confusing the latter as being cynical when their not and just like appabend no i dont think any of this was intentional on the writers and directors part its just as you see that they cant write in honor of feminism anymore because unless they make mary sue shat theyll end up with the barbie movie where they highlight only realizing too late when others point it out that feminism or their and the bitter modern feminist idea of it will only bring bitterness and unhappiness says something when the kens easily take over barbieland with how the barbies want to serve them and they take it back by serving them so well that they turn the kens against each other but appa points out how some of the barbies whole doing so may have genuinely lost themselves in the deception that they would prefer serving their kenshusbands and notes the writers idiotically and unintentionally insinuated that its not the femnists out shouting screeching and riotingprotesting changing the world its the only fan girl being surround by simps ready to sell their whole family and murder their male long time bff if it will get her to notice him for a second

i absolutely love this movie it somehow exceeds my expectation about the theme this movie is presenting i love how the barbies part is treated maturely for example finding purpose as a doll accepting change facing some level of identity crisis etc without shining away from comedic parts of the film

although i have to admit that the message of this film is mixed and how they treat males in it is quite offputting considering positive lessons the girls receive in the end but i dont think its absolutely 100 negative for males

i understand that making all the kens propatriarchy overly stupid and borderline misogynist is not the best move they can pull off hell its quite terrible even but i find the later arc which features ken having existential crisis having conflicts with all of the kens quite full of potential and the part where ken feels like an accessories to barbie to be emotional its also especially relatable for me due to me having low selfworth i still however find kens existential crisis resolves quite well still i would not shy away the fact that first half of kens conflict within barbie world is not an enjoyable story

also i enjoy how the writers poke fun at corporate figures aiming to be for girls and their target demographic it feels like a slap to your own face since this movies is in association with mattel themselves and i appreciate it

spoilers ahead  and a review





some parts of the movie were a little too heavy handed in the toxic variety of feminism it could have been handled better 

what you said at 210 is how women were viewed in society before we fought back you voiced our history perfectly in one concise sentence toward the end how you were so upset about how the barbies treated the kens is exactly why women were upset about how men saw and treated women youre feeling the roots of what its like to be on that side weve come a long way since the suffragette movement but guess what sparked it generations and generations of experiencing what you just said with very little to no power to do anything about it 

feminism is not hate all men thats horrible toxic and wrong 
real feminism is equality for both sides its the state of being human accepted by both  laughing crying being sensitive being powerful influential right and wrong 

whoever tells you feminism the former is a moron 

barbie land failed horribly at being equal they didnt see anything wrong with it from their perspective the status quo was perfect 

it wasnt that was the point 

i would have been upset if this movie ended with barbie land going back to kens just being accessories but it didnt you missed the ending because they changed it at the end  and they did it in a realistic way with president barbie granting more rights and power to the kens but littlebylittle and not too high too fast exactly what men in the past did 

the disproportionate distribution of power made me scrunch up my nose in disgust id personally though the kens were equal to barbies 

ken saying to barbie how does that feel when she comes back to find shes the accessory hit hard you could tell from the beginning that kens were always accessories to barbies  like a purse with pants i felt for ken  for what was really going on deep down hidden behind the mask of bravado and toxic masculinity was the pain of being brushed aside and treated as a commodity 

i felt that when no one listens to you believes you or takes you seriously it hurts and can lead to disproportionate outbursts and actions born of frustration and anger that once came from a place of love 

being a woman with adhd and autism and rsd and all the fun things that come with it failing to be a neurotypical stereotypical woman and disregarded as being overdramatic too sensitive not believed hurts a lifetime of this adds up

ken found patriarchy and went to 11 with it back in barbie land because he and the boys were basically what women were before we got fed up  props belongings held very few jobs and didnt hold any significant power of course he took it to 11 because once you find a way to have some control you grab onto it and go to space then kens wanted to be seen thats fair he saw other men in positions that barbies held and he felt necessary included and needed 

i was really glad for what they did at the end i was happy when president barbie said things shouldnt go back to the way they were no one should be in someone elses shadow she even apologized to weird barbie  although weird barbie owned it from that point on its suggested that barbie land became a place of equality for both kens and barbies  especially since the real world now had boys finding empowerment in barbies with the mojo dojo casa house 

ken saying he lost interest in patriarchy when he realized it wasnt about horses made me laugh cowboys are seen as a mans man 

but also as someone whos ace i felt this movie was for me and those like me having the message of a situation not ending in a romantic relationship was so satisfying to see it was like seeing justification in having love for someone of the opposite sex without wanting to bone them its always irritated me that the end goal should always be boy girl  must screw like no boy girl  must not screw 

barbie apologized to ken for the way shed treated him she had already figured out who she is or the other barbies with jobs did so she encouraged ken to find out who he really is without her being part of his identity 

that was the problem with the ken doll from the start he didnt have his own identity 

not to mention poor alan allan both they removed the l from his name in a later release hes kens buddy the third wheel hes married to midge i love that that they had pregnant midge in the movie because karens shat all over that doll when it was released like dude your generation wants us to be mothers but you dont want us to know sex education just fuck and pump out kids thats very much a you dont need to know just do as i say and find a husband and give me a grandkid eye roll 

moor power to pregnant midge 

and the barbie whos boobs inflate a real doll one meant to teach little girls about whatll happen when they mature let me tell you if not for an understanding people in my life i would have been scared shitless when i hit puberty and suddenly had a rack big enough to support a mug standing on its own hell when i hit my period i thought i was hemorrhaging to death and had an honesttogod panic attack and fear for my life my teacher had to calm me down and explain it and called my mom to let her know what was going on my male teacher he was smart understanding kind empathetic and professional i stayed in his office until my mom picked me up while he went back to continue teaching because he understood that i couldnt be out on the playground with my peers at that moment he understood the psychological damage that would cause  

in playing with barbies as a little girl i never did the  get married and play house and be domestic thing that was what i was expected to do when i grew up and i didnt want to do that 

i had a dream house but it was more a base of operations for the adventures my dolls would go on with my star wars figurines my barbies and kens were jedi or heroes who fought bad guys evil wizards and evil kings 

i agree with the ceo regular barbie is a bad idea depression barbie had me rolling on the floor because yup takes antidepressants we need an adhd and autistic barbie  comes with a fridge she can put her phone or keys in when she puts them down to pick up the milk and closes the door then cant find them later",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTv9f2EtWDSQ54wwqQ2V9oQ,-0.6741,negative,True

people treating this movie as just a bit of harmless fun is problematic to me from what i have heard because theres no way im ever seeing this perks of a long distance relationship is that this film is unapologetically feministmisandrist which focuses on the idea of the ultimate evil the patriarchy

only the mentally deficient or uneducated people incapable of a single distinctive thought can actually believe in the patriarchy if you even agree with the message and the exhausting rhetoric that is taught in every major university you need to seriously educate yourself and see the actual ubiquitous oppression that is happening in the west i got news for you women are in no capacity by definition oppressed in america the only gender that is actively discriminated devalued and demonized on a societal scale is men do women face struggles and hardships like every other person in the world yes but that is solely on an individual level there are women that live horrible lives that another man couldnt even comprehend but its not because of some all encompassing misogynistic governmental system that ensures women are at a disadvantage in every facet of society 

if that was true 

why are women able to make millions of dollars by objectifying themselves on of why are women given leniency for committing the same crimes as a man why are there no domestic shelters for men even though statistics say that women are just as likely to be the abusers why do men make up nearly 80 of the suicide rates why are women excluded from the draft  what is with the obvious bias in divorce courts why do men have no say in abortions why are there no morbidly obese men as models why are women capable of uprooting a mans entire life with one word with zero evidence i can keep going btw

do your research and recognize how harmful this continued narrative thats being spun is to both women and men especially the impact it will have on young girls and boys its perpetuating the war between the sexes how any person would support an overtly hateful and one sided film is beyond me people that have seen it admit its incredibly heavyhanded so what else would you call it but propaganda that is targeted towards impressionable youth which hopefully have parents that are of sound mind and have a long discussion with them about how mislead the people are that made the film

obviously the goal is to stop the kens from ruining barbieland with their parody version of a patriarchy but they make a point to show that the barbies dont want everything to go back to the way it was because they learned that mistreating the kens was wrong too if that ending hadnt happened then i would agree with you here drinker",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI38N_aGGeQXBDT_HtLADnQ,-0.7605,negative,True

i definitely get that the movie layered their message a little too thick but the sarcasm was definitely there the movie acknowledged ken being seen as a 2nd class citizen that the barbies didnt like having the tables turned on them and the ending of getting the kens to get jealous and cat fighting is such a stereotypical woman thing to do to each other when they get jealous

the points i am with you is the characterization of the real world with this stereotypical mens behavior which doesnt reflect the real world at all maybe that part is just exaggerated to show the duality of both extremes but brings the wrong message that we have the opposite problem than barbies world gender wise

60188,@riccardoarpea9966,22/7/2023,17:52:42,0,"i think i see this movie as a reflection on the public discourse around gender roles and how its articulated
theres feminism in there granted but im not so sure thats the correct answer according to the moral compass of the film 
what it does is it summarises the stereotypes about gender roles in very broad strokes pits them against each other and shows the viewers that both have their issues and in their own ways suck 
the barbie utopia in the beginning might seem some kind of feminist fever dream but its shallow empty frivolous and it doesnt leave a 100 good impression on the viewer believe me i was watching the film with two ladies and they both were like this world kinda sucks barbie is horrible to ken 
theres a line towards the beginning which is a critique to woke culture in big companies that i rather enjoyed something along the lines of the barbies believing they solved real world problems by selling toys only to then discover that its not the case
i mean remember how the marketing around black panther made it seem like that film alone solved racism poverty and hunger 

ken is mistreated in the beginning and i think its that way so that men in the audience can easily empathise and find their own point of view 
it seems like it wants to be a clever subversion in that through the eyes of ken the man in the audience should get angrier and angrier at how fellow men in the film are treated with a not so subtle subtext of youre pissed now well this is what women go through everyday because of you have a taste which is in line with what a feminist with victim mentality would probably think
i see it as some kind of trap in case a man complains about how unfair the treatment ken gets is
i dont agree with the message but ill further develop on that later

watching the movie i was ok with that dynamic because i found a theme of escapism having your own personal space to go to and forget all the hardships of real life now the movie is called barbie is about a barbie doll it wasnt made for me this time for real brie and i respect that let barbie be the feminist safe heaven for girls and women to escape to and have dreams of their ideal reality we dont have to agree its the realm of imagination they can do whatever with it and have every right to do so a film called barbie was never gonna be about equality it was always gonna be about barbie
however something got me big time
this thing about escapism safe heaven being able to do what we want with our imagination is what we always say when woke culture bleeds into the things we like i for one have had this feeling for more than 10 years that some of my favourite entertainment was being hijacked by people who didnt like it by a culture that was totally unrelated to the point where i felt kicked out of some of my passions
now demanding a masculine injection in a barbie film is exactly the same thing as demanding a feminine injection in your marvel movies james bond indiana jones star wars and so on its unpleasant wrong and you wont be any different from those hacks we all criticise

at the end of the movie barbie doesnt pick a side she just goes away and tries being human which to me is kind of a good message its like acknowledging that life is not as clear cut and stereotypical as the discourse around gender roles makes it to be
its barbie leaving all the pink behind and discovering the shades of grey 

overall there are two messages in the film that i definitely dont agree with
1 the fact that according to the feminist gospel the contemporary west is depicted as some kind of taliban afghanistan which is factually incorrect
2 the whole thing about the symbol of heroes having to be down to earth in order for people to feel better about themselves 
ive always liked my heroes to be aspirational i was a chubby italian kid when i fell in love with dragon ball and i never felt the need to identify with the protagonist a buff asian man from space in order for me to adore him i like heroes to be models both physical and personalitywise i want them to set examples however lofty to push and motivate people to be better versions of themselves
nowadays on the other hand theres this thing where heroes should be as similar to you as possible and deliver a message of self acceptance which is not bad per se but its not what a hero should do either the self acceptance message pushed to the extreme feels just like an excuse to stay in your mediocrity and complain and bitch about it and convince yourself that youre never wrong never to be questioned its all others fault be it people society the patriarchy and whatnot and that to me is intellectual death
im the kind of person that dont like to see fat on you dont blame the impossible beauty standards of marvel actors and get your ass to the gym 

overall i found the film interesting and amusing 
and what was also interesting and amusing is that the two women i was with right after the film ended commented something like but its not true that the world is like that to us women",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWyuUeVz4U8gPVl02OBHvg,0.9977,positive,True

the movie doesnt celebrate motherhood greta gerwig has said time and time again that the trials and tribulations of being a mom herself often bleed into her work the entire movie is about motherhood as well as independence all the ways femininity can exist the scene where the mom talks about how it sometimes feels like women hate women just like men hate women because its a just a slice of the issues women face as barbie as a brand quite literally revolves around the female image in society the mom also clearly states that shes tired of society putting down women who want to be mothers women who want to have careers women who want to be noncombative and women who are too combative even believe it or not its about all the ways masculinity can exist too that scene where barbie consoles ken that he doesnt have to revolve around her  she doesnt own him and hes his own person just like shes her own person and he can do whatever he dreams of maybe its barbie and its ken the kens were made to be docile at first in the movie for a reason as a plot device especially as its canon in barbie lore  ask any little girl barbie is literally everything to them and hes just ken and not because they hate men lmao again did we watch the same movie 

i agree that it could get preachy at times and it stumbled a bit at the end with the barbies and the kens not getting an equal government but its barbie land for chrissakes  its in the name who tf wants barbie and ken land its like how no one even most womengirls would want a spiderman and captain marvel duo movie  we just want spiderman all in all its a camp movie that tries to touch on all these issues and out of all the ip live action movies it is one of the very few that succeeds the most admittedly by a long shot again typically agree with your takes but i urge you to rewatch this movie with a different lens ignoring your seeming urge to appeal to your typically antiwoke audience i await your next upload thanks ",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeXgLWTYI2QumPoHfs9RzQ,0.9695,positive,True

this is a problem since to the extent ken is a stand in for an oppressed womanhood this oppression has always relied on the dependence of society and of men on women for example traditional masculinity is inconceivable without traditional femininity womens productive activities eg in the home or in certain epochs as slaves servants etc is integral to the wealth and continuation of the society including masculinity men etc 

the film appears to ignore this dialectical relation of men and women and therefore presents an extremely foolish mirage of feminism by tacitly asserting that women contribute nothing of value to society and are neither productive nor necessary they have in short been presented as mere commodities rather than as humanstending to undermine the ostensible premises of the film

further i kind of liked main kens arc while he got friendzoned hard and i feel for our fallen brother the message that hes enough just by himself and that he doesnt need a barbie to be someone rung with me
that said the political buzzwords used and the ideas they represent did put a dampener on my mood and were part of the aforementioned cringe in the movie

the fact that the joke at the end didnt dawn on you that the kens enter a lower level of government and have to work their way up and how that relates to women in the real world is interesting they arent saying they shouldnt have power they are making a comment on how the power is slowly being equal and if you hate that well thats exactly what happened with women thats the irony 
yes ken does like patriarchy because its the first time hes been recieved attention thats the point yes they frame him to be childish and silly they do the same with the barbies because of the dolls reflect the people playing with them then they would be children 
also i dont think we are supposed to agree with the daughter the monologue she says calling barbie a facist isnt supposed to be empowering but show how misguided teens are who go into the adult world trying to be mature and sophisticated 
the movie doesnt dig at mothers infact gloria makes a point that mothers are made fun of for maybe just wanting to be a mother and thats ok 
the movie shows many sides of the whole thing and its not a man hating machine it actually proves extremist feminists that men shouldnt be treated the way the kens got treated and that the next step is a more equal future",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSirtq96PtvXulCSXzsgAXA,0.9885,positive,True

basically for the last two decades we started with some attempts at equality but the message didnt really hit home so they just started saying the message louder and made it more extreme

the end result is that only people who already believe in the message or were ready to believe it will accept it anyone else is pushed away vilified and told they should join the group that vilifies them and be happy about it if you try to resist it even if you tell them they could do better you can rest assured that they will censor you dox you ridicule you and in some cases even accuse you and get you to court where proving your innocence has no consequences for the people who lied while even being accused often has permanent life changing consequences even if you are declared innocent

the fact barbie didnt try to change the real world to be led by all women is something i really appreciated now i do wish the real world was a little morereal ig theres bad men irl just like theres good men and bad women too like they almost had it when all the men ken talked to denied him a job due to lacking qualifications but i wish the one business guy didnt go all we learned to hide the patriarchy better that was probably the main line that rubbed me the wrong way and im still not sure why

i also found sashas charicature so extreme that i took it as a joke sasha was the little girl barbie thought was the one who used to play with her no one took her seriously and i really thought it wasnt meant to be literal and taken as a good depiction i was laughing with almost every word that came from her mouth

it also made sense to me why ken went straight patriarchy it was the only time he was valued as a man and felt like he was treated like a person it perfectly reflects what i see with the really nasty incel types of men who are genuinely toxic it made me cringe and laugh but it didnt feel forced either

i will say i do really wish that the end answer was that barbie land took a more egalitarian approach they allude to it in the film when the kens ask to be supreme court judges and the president  tells them that they can start in lower circuits so they can earn their way up to sc judge its realistic and reasonable for someone to work their way up but i wish we got to see a shot of barbie land many years later where the kens were respected by the barbies as actual people",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY5fNap-OPHNy8OkiJujQQg,0.996,positive,True

for example i hear that ken is a stalker in the movie well in the world of barbie ken needs barbie i think he even has a song talking about how hes nothing without barbie and its true in a sales sense girls arent just gunna play with a ken doll theyre gunna play with barbie then want her to have a boyfriend or husband so you just buy the one male doll they have for her which is ken at the same time it can easily be seen as feminist stuff oh ken is just fawning for barbie because shes hot and women just want men to fall for em and blah blah but again im a woman and i played with barbies so i kinda saw that feminist aspect of it after laughing at the fact ken does need barbie or he wont sell i mean men would you play with a ken doll i know guys play with army dudes n such so i doubt theyd play with ken unless he was in army gear like that one g i joe doll which if you were a girl and you had brothers and one of em had that doll he was way better than ken because ken was such a god damn pretty boy despite having muscles lol

this does piss me off a lot though if it is just feminist bs because the opening with the 2001 nod perfectly expresses how girls saw barbie when she dropped in 1959 girls were trapped in a life of just these big bulky baby dolls just playing house as the mom all the time but then barbie arrives and tells girls hey you dont just have to be a mom look at me im a doctor a veterinarian an astronaut fast food worker etc you can be what you want this can also be seen as feminist of course but i see it has telling girls they have more options than just being an at home mom women deserve to be more than just someone who sits home and cleans and pumps out babies im not bashing on women who do wanna stay home and clean and pump out babies im just saying women deserve more than just that one option in life

im assuming  they did the ol trick of just showing in the trailer and interviews the good parts of the movie which were like 5 min total while the rest of the 200 min is just men suck men suck men suck men suck if so then shame on them shame on me for having some hope since ya know it actually looks like they put effort into the damn movie the part where barbie just floats down from her house that has to be because kids never used the stairs to bring barbie down they just whip her outta the house and go i thought that was great but now im wondering if that was just a mistake like they did that for whimsy and not to show that kids never used the stairs in the dream house

after writing this and watching this its making me wonder if barbie actually was a feminist ploy and not something to show girls they can do more than be a mom  yeah it has to be it my cynic side is coming through is telling me im right on that like i want barbie to be about telling girls they can do more than be a mom but i know from the makers viewpoint it was for money and to trick girls into feminism without really knowing it as a kid girls never wanted to be barbie they just wanted her stuff the bitch had a private jet at one point lol who wouldnt want that

 of course they eventually came out with ken so barbie can have a bf but like ken was just there like i said before ken was just ken he never had a job when you bought him either he would have a theme and  thats it to match your barbie you got that malibu barbie well heres malibu ken to go with her they match clothes thats it also as a kid though we never thought more of it we just played i know when i played with my barbies i basically made them into trash because it was more fun than having a perfect life sure at first its fun to have things neat and typical but that gets boring like i said and so i made my barbie a crack head the ken was an alcoholic wife beater and they had kids who were junkies too lmao

you of course did have the girls who were very protective of their dolls wouldnt let anyone else play with em kept em neat and perfect all the time which is fine but like i said that shit gets boring for the average girls oh man that reminds me my bff had the barbie with the wheelchair we tossed her down the stairs in that chair so many times and died laughing we also made other characters outta old cheese graders and a ladle for our barbies to interact with there was one barbie that got banned that id love to have which is the one with a pregnant barbie where you can take off her preggo tummy and the baby inside

wait why is there a fat girls in this movie barbie never had fat friendsguess they really do want this to be feminist otherwise theyd have no fat broads in there because again there was never a fat barbie because they didnt want girls to get the wrong idea that being fat was good lol but they want girls to think being that tall and thin is good even though the proportions are impossible af not to mention there was never an asian ken doll ever just a black one at one point idk how much thats changed though im 34 now i dont play with barbies or go down that aisle in the store anymore lol

wait why didnt the kens just leave after all that fighting and tricking the barbies did instead they just go back to being slaves and are ok with it after all that bs with the patriarchy they did they could have easily just left to make their own town fo kens but like i said before in the real world a ken doll by itself wouldnt sell so the kens need the barbies and theyre making it seem like thats how real life works when we all know it doesnt i think women are just tired of being told they need men to survive n what not theyre tired of being reminded of it but at the same time they keep trying to prove they dont need men and its just exposing just how bad women need them and making it all worse women feel like if they stop with the feminist stuff now that all men are going to just make them slaves like how women were in the 50s stuck at home a mad husband comes home gets drunk and beats them then goes to sleep while the woman has to clean the mess the man just made they dont wanna be stuck in that situation but this feminist shit isnt helping women at all its making it worse for em because theyre not telling women how to actually exist without a man theyre not showing women how to change car tires or car oil or how to fix a leaking sink they just tell women you dont need men and nothing else not to mention they try and push that women would make the world better more peaceful uhm no women are very emotional and we hate it i know i do whats worse is when were on our periods we cant really control our emotions on the rag we know this too well like see a puppy and cry about how cute it is and while crying be like i fugging hate my period this is stupid why am i crying at how cute a puppy is but that doesnt stop the emotions from happening its also why we get pissed when men have the gall to tell us were just on our period whenever we get upset as if thats the only time we get mad is when our emotions are crazy and we dont have any real reason to be mad ever while women do have more compassion inherently our emotions make it difficult to stay compassionate when things happen again we dont like it it sucks but thats how women are

one last thing im a woman with flat feet real nice how the barbies reacted when barbie got flat fugging feet imagine if i was a kid and i saw that just wtf this barbie movie is a perfect example of typical capitalism too they lie to you so you will buy their product and once you do you find out its nothing but a lie and trash and by that time you already wasted your money we need honest capitalism if we want the country to go back to being fine people wont get as rich but there will be less lies and trickery until someone inevitably fugs that up well have honest capitalism for awhile until we get comfy with it and then someone will come along and turn it back into typical capitalism its very hard to keep an honest rule or law upheld when it comes to humanity were just such greedy pieces of shet that were not happy with what we have we always need more more more more morem ore",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq7KfXwW2CiAqUkay2CNTTw,0.9949,positive,True

62098,@sematy4948,22/7/2023,16:30:16,3,"i think the point they were trying to get across in the barbie world was like patriarchy but in reverse ie matriarchy
but here are some of the bad points i noticed after watching the film
1 nothing actually changed aside from main barbie by the end were back to the status quo just without main barbie in the barbie world  from a storytelling standpoint thats one of the worst since it seems like nothing happened and learned by the characters 
2 it was weird that the lesson that the main ken got from the real world is that men rule the world and you wanna make me believe that there is no female employee in the entire mattel company aside from the mother the other members of the board are also irrelevant in fact we could even remove the entire mattel company aside from the ghost of ruth handler and nothing will change 
3 the annoying teenage daughter is not needed when they revealed that the mother is actually the one inserting intrusive thoughts to main barbie there is no need for the girl to be in there anymore shes just a red herring
4 how did ken realizing that hes more than just barbies girlfriend resolved any problems they seemed to be looked down upon at the start it seems that they were ostracized 
a we dont know where the kens lived they just occupied the barbie dream houses when main barbie returned to barbie land 
b we dont know what jobs they actually do aside from lifeguard i suppose they dont have a family system only girlfriendboyfriend or friendfriend dynamics and the barbies do most if not all jobs so we cant just assume that theyre the housekeepers 
c they dominated the barbie land because the real world has patriarchy and that the barbies were all brainwashed by the idea and what did the main barbie and crew do to undo the brainwashing they indoctrinate the barbies with mostly feminist beliefs and poof the barbies are back to themselves 
d how did the barbies defeat the kens emotional manipulation the barbies made their partner kens believe that they now have romantic feelings towards them which are what wha most of them crave and then they made them jealous by flirting with other kens that campfire scene was very disheartening do all barbies really feel that way there isnt even a single barbie or ken who is opposed to this dichotomy there isnt a single conflict amongst the barbies about that plan

although i commend some good parts here and there the comeback of main ken about not being invited by his partner barbie is great but the solution was emotional manipulation instead of a genuine heartfelt apology yes there was an apology and it seemed like main barbie has guilt but she still proceeded with her plan anyways so it feels unearned 

to be honest i was starting to like the film when main barbie and main ken went to the real world to find main barbies owner but by the time they introduced the patriarchy concept to ken i was really disappointed it shouldve been a lighthearted drama film where they try to know and resolve the problem together and if it fits the situation even develop romantic feelings for each other since the early scenes could lead to that but no they had to insert a barbiesvskens conflict so the useless war of man vs woman is perpetuated 

im a man and my sister and i used to watch barbie films when we were younger esp since we dont really bother picking which films for children to watch and besides classic barbie had good moral lessons and are fairly entertaining

why did they have to f this up barbie is already a good representation of a strong independent woman even back in the day she can be whatever she wants and ken is just an extra or even a bonus love interest but to make him a villain thats just so messed up ",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg_SK03fNlgnUo_jcBNWQwA,0.9409,positive,True

from my understanding the barbies are said to live in a matriarchy  all positions of power are held by women do men hold any positions of power isnt there a scene where ken cannot find a male doctor

butwomen hold positions of power and influential jobs like doctors and lawyers in our patriarchal world soby its own logic the movie is saying we do not live in a patriarchy

the premise of the movie is that in barbieland there is genderswapped oppression as such margot robbies character plays the role of a deeply sexist conservative throughout the movie she makes it pretty clear that her main goal is to conserve the status quo to restore everything to how it was before 
opposing her is ken who takes the role of the reactionary feminist extremist while he fights for the rights of the oppressed male gender he does not aim for equality but instead merely seeks to enstate equal and opposite oppression of barbies as ken is a member of the weaker sex by barbieland standards he is to stupid to understand what he is fighting for hes so stupid he thinks patriarchy which in barbieland takes on the role of genderswapped feminist extremism is about horses

when barbie returns from the real world she must save her fellow women who have all fallen pray to kens woke mind virus after deprograming the other brainwashed barbies they work together successfully to roll back voting rights for men in barbieland 

after a successful coup barbie is confronted by ken who admits that he as a member of the weaker sex is unfit to rule and that he really only wanted her attention all along

for the great achievement of reinstating the original sexist regime in barbieland and maintaining the status quo barbie is personally thanked by god her creatorinventor and ascends to another plane of existence the real world

barbie the movie feels like more of an addendum in this critique i personally am a fair ways outside the target demographic for anything barbie so maybe not being associated with much barbie outside of this film affects my read that said i dont feel that the film fails to achieve sufficient feminism or to educate a broader audience on the finer points of the topic so much as i feel that it aims for and in my opinion succeeds at a different objective it illustrates the experience of living as a woman in cultures similar to america as one permutation of the human experience as a whole the point is not to break down the complex mechanics of patriarchy in our society the point is to reach women who live under this system and to say you are not wrong or antisocial for feeling like you never will be enough you always were and always will be enough you just live inside a system that convinces you otherwise to benefit other people another part of the point is that you the human ultimately have to decide on your own that getting to experience your life is worth enduring the simultaneous experience of enduring life as a woman in this system i think that element of empathy and feeling seen is what motivates people to applaud this movie so much and yes sometimes oversell it

i do like how that gets illustrated in this film it gets across that point emotionally to an audience that may not have had all of this explained to them logically yet not everyone lives in online progressive spaces and hashes this stuff out every day that said i cant blame people for having trouble seeing any of that through the context of mattels business practices this films inevitable and simultaneous role as a marketing tool andor whatever role that barbie the brand has played in their own lives

i mean sure stereotypical barbie herself gets to become a real girl and leave barbieland after learning that life with pain is more fulfilling than a plastic existence and ken learns something something about being kenough but these changes are all about individuals perspectiecs and feed into the making the world a better place is all about peoples personal growth i couldnt help but think of the ending scene of the matrix the only one they ever made i refuse to accept the lie that there were ever matrix sequels where you dont know what change is coming but what it means to be a happy ending isnt just neo learning something about himself no the happy ending is neo saying listen up holes things are about to change around here

im not saying the movie should have been different theres a place in the world for babys first feminism and stories of personal growth can be stories worth telling but the takes about the movie being some sort of feminist masterpiece feel hollow to me in part for just this reason i thought feminism was supposed to be about dismantling and restructuring the social order to create a more just society not just incrementalism and the lessons we learned along the waytm",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6XG9r7oJU1ixftFf_73LNw,0.9665,positive,True

small side note the original story of beauty and the beast was absolutely about arranged marriage but the disney version is different its a story about perception being different than reality the beast keeping belle in her sick fathers place was his first sign of mercy they have to learn about each other before he puts forth any real effort and she doesnt fall in love with him until he proves to her there is something worth loving on the inside the effort isnt coming from her to get used to an ugly person thats what would have happened if shed been pressured into saying yes to gaston the handsome man who was ugly on the inside the only reason they fooled around with the animated version was money it was already as good as that story could get",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYPEbA0_8WOFb3BEDE9YTSQ,0.7327,positive,True

doesnt it mean something that this movie has ideas that are threatening to conservative men doesnt it mean something that a movie about a plastic doll had concepts dangerous enough to be banned in lebanon and kuwait feminism as a concept has expanded to have conservative and capitalistic streams if feminism can exist in a corporate world and in anticorporate world why cant the corporate version trite as it is be just as earnest in the same way that women like leona helmsley or elizabeth moss can abuse people through capitalism where they act as horribly as white men by internalizing capitalism i feel like barbie can still be empowering or equally oppressing to women and girls sometimes things can be complicated and have mixed messaging it is frustrating that even without buying a barbie doll that mattel still benefits from the money they made from ticket sales while using unethical labour but i do think its interesting how weve gotten to a point where that can also coexist with the mainstream of conservatives bothered by feminist messaging in a corporate packaged product i think being that frustratingly mixed is a sign of progress but also how much work is yet to be done about labour and capitalism

this film is an excuse to blantly reinvent barbie as feminist to sell to new generations as you expertly researched and pointed out but i think we can still enjoy the film as a standalone film while reject the intended purpose to get us to by dolls that harm workers and the environment if mattel were to cease to exist as a corporation how could this film benefit them it would be interesting to see you take a closer look at the film in isolation and see just how earnest or well the feminist messaging holds up",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD45N2N6HmlRjmZrXestTbQ,-0.6896,negative,True

it is a great relief to have these ambivalent feelings about the film validated by someone else i seemed to be the only one in my mostly male group who felt kinda down and angry after leaving the theater but i didnt have the emotional capacity to start a discussion
the way everyone just laughed at the jokes and then went on with their lives while i was closer to tears of anger and frustration than laughter during most scenes really irritated me

yes the film addresses some important points of feminism but what does it really change what are the implications for viewers and how does it help women in real life as a woman working in the filmphotography industry myself i usually watch the credits and although there were quite a few female names in the barbie credits which is very unusual it was still very much dominated by men
thats just one thing i personally pay attention to and your review allowed me to investigate these kinds of issues further

this line was the one that ruined the film for me beyond the incredibly shallow feminism it portrays by saying this and breaking the fourth wall the film implies that a beautiful woman such as margot robbie cant feel bad about her looks and had the casting choice been a different woman that was perceived as less beautiful barbie would be valid as to feeling ugly i think this stance is completely against any feminist idea therefore making the film feel completely hypocritical

instead of going for the safe option here which was breaking the fourth wall with complete lack of profession they could have further pushed the idea that even the most beautiful of women feels this way and that is validhttpwwwyoutubecomchannelucp6hotedbjr3pzmrmdgmgsq

for me the movie wasnt really a feministic movie in a way that it changed everything glorias speech felt a bit empty what i do really love about the movie is that it starts a conversation and i hope because it people that werent familiar with the importance of feminism will see what a weird system the patriarchy is kens view of patriarchy is childlike but his grasp of it shows very well how insane the whole construct is and how you get dragged into it i hope it empowers people in that way by showing it is all insane and that you should let no person and no system define you

but its still got weird almost gross moments that give away that even the people who made the film with the idea of it being profeminist are still kinda brainwashed by the patriarchy theyre trying to criticize or at least mattel had a chokehold over how far the writers were allowed to go

like at the very beginning were briefly introduced to pregnant barbie who is shunned viewed with disgust why because pregnancy is a sign of the patriarchy i guess you cant be a feminist and pregnant if you want to be a feminist woman you have to start your own business and be successful or be a hyper intelligent scientist or work your way up the political ladder to make real change in the world but pregnancy being a mother oh no no thats not allowed in idealized feminist barbieland because thats a traditional role and us progressive young women dont abide by that anymore bah humbug

look i dont want to be pregnant or a mother i have always hated the idea of both but it just rubbed me the wrong way seeing the movie poke fun at that way of life right out of the gate and it put a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie girls can do anything they can dream of except fall in love or start a family girls dont do that anymore

its like weird backwards weaponized feminism its exchanging the previous sentiment of women have to be mothers and swapping it out for women have to be leaders feminism is about the ability to choose and theres still no choice here because you still get shunned just in the other direction",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl42-VZHid0ar0sRFlTXiZA,0.8295,positive,True

this movie felt like a rip off of the 90s00s girly girl power coming of age type of genre with tbh less progressive messaging then they often had back then 

like if barbie is meant to be a character that women can see and understand themselves through giving them the most benefit of the doubt i can lets say shes explicitly and only meant to be that for young girls in extremly sheltered and privliged positions like barbie was 

then tbh honest its a massive back slide the way they have the barbies interact w the kens i remember being young and understanding boys thought girls were these unknowable alien beings with intrests and thoughts so seperate from their own they were practically a diffrent species and the older girl power movies allow that to make sense to be explained wo reinforcing the idea that we really are just seperate entities w little nothing in common rather just 

a diffrent human a girly girl by choice not design or nature 

i havent walked away from a movie that made me feel more alien in my own skin when it was trying to make an emktional connection with me 

this movie feels blatantly like it wants to sell you femisim rather than allow its self to exist within femism

like they explicitly tell us by the end of the movie the kens are homelss in barbie land that part of their acting out was driven by an actual need for recognition and material saftey to take the movie and its premise far to seriously lol and the barbies dont care  the narrator straight up says that once the barbies are back in charge everything goes back to the way it was and implies it will be an uphill battle for the kens to have homes 

like that plus the really zero explination from the barbie brainwashing than brainwashing  like so well spend bigs chunks of this movie establishing why young men flock to patriarchy but young women get a one liner and told well theyre just brainwashed 

like this movie very easily could have had a simple and potent message that wasmt far from what it wanted to do they just needed a little more focus on the mother and her daughter make it about their conflicting personalities 

about how her dayghter is growing up and coming to understand on her own what it means to be a woman in ths world but her ideas conflict and rail against her mothers this young girl has found patriarchycapitalism and naturally is railing against it going through that phase a lot of us had where pink and girly girl things and beauty and standard binary feminity represents everything we dont want for ourselves all the patriarchy and expectation we dont want placed on our shoulders as little girls the onner turmiol of understanding capatalism is acurrupt system you cant exist hut wishing you could just stop participating all the same  and dealong with those things in the heighten extremly emotional and confused way a young teen girl would valodate her and young kids everywhere seeing the currupt systems around them and having to come to grips with that fact that many of the people and adult around them will just see those systems as normal unchangable not worth worrying over thats a hard experience as a kid you feel afraid alone and crazy 

have her mother be this hyper feminine corperate woman whos doing her best to keep her and her doughter a float inside this capatilidy patriarchy show us her all done up in make up dresses pencil skirts  and worse yet in her daughters eyes dating men well off men let her daughter assume the worst that she dates for the possibility of their money that her mother is a capitalist cog that she is feminine because her mother chooses what she perceives as the saftey of feminity and beauty in patriarchy 

and let barbie be the figure that teaches her you can be pink and your own let barbie and the child graple with barbies starnge place withing capatilism patriarchy and feminism her odd but not all that unique position as an entity that both inspires and harms that she is both the representation of the billion dollar corperation who is inherently unethical 
and a harmless doll who as her own individual self has brought joy and inspiration to young kids everywhere 
that shows her unfortunately there is no safer version of feminity only different battles different insults diffrent harms do so by showing us barbie expeirnceing many diverse types of woman hood in the real world getting to know people from vastly diffeent walks of life 

through barbie help young girls understand that a different type of womanhood unfortunately might not be the answer but also isnt the probelm that yes these problems are big and scary and part of why adults dont adress them in ways that make sense is because to them it doesnt that the probelms of this world are so big no one individual can have the answer and a lot of them are just as scared as you but that the more we learn to understand and love one another instead of arguing of the harmless things turning instead together towards the things that hurt us all it may still feel scary and powerless some time  but theres much more power in our live and unity then there is in deciding what kinds of feminity are allowed inside the movement 

it would still be a take for you her audiences but at least it would be a take

if the core message was supposed to be about the dualaties and complexities of being human in a hyper binarily genered world coming to terms w patriarchy self identity and even the bit about how patriarchy harms and deteriorates even the men who uphold and participate willingly in it  i honestly think they failed they have isolated scenes that convey thats what they wanted but the movie as a whole really only conveys comedy and half baked women should rule the world because patriarchy is fucked which just sigh",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVOLaE52Es0f8d6Lf8eSNXw,-0.9855,negative,True

it was poorly written with too many themes it didnt nail down properly and at the end we still had kens being treated as lowerclass citizens and barbie just wanted to wear comfortable shoes and see a gynecologist for her new real lady parts female anatomy was the height of her feminism and the culmination of your journey despite her never mentioning thats what she wanted i shook my head and said youve got to be kidding me

it addressed cellulite and aging as a terrible thing and never showed us any different in the story one comment to an old lady does not count as a full story arc at no point did barbie embrace that for herself or lose her hollywood beauty nor make a choice that would show her prioritizing anything above looking good and having her house back

the barbies being tricked so easily by the kens made them look insanely stupid i sat there wondering if the film was also insulting real women for falling for misogyny and it was soooo easy for the barbies to reverse are they trying to say real women arent trying hard enough

this whole film is a joke on women men and feminism i have no idea who this movie was even made for im fairly conservative and the lack of respect to women was infuriating yet so many women are eating it up it makes me feel sick theyre applauding a joke at their expense theyre paying to be pandered and talked down to

barbie should have been so much better it could have been a fun campy girlpower movie but while it looked that way from the marketing i found it a major baitandswitch scam with a bitter pill to swallow instead

ill never buy another barbie not as a gift nor as a collectable im so tired of their shallow view of women i loved her growing up but i feel totally betrayed by the both the film and the barbie factory conditions shame on mattel

the films sole objective is to rebrand repurpose and redefine barbies tarnished image for a new generation of little girls that stopped finding her relevant and interesting so barbie does whatever she can throughout the film to convince little girls she is tough independent funny and cool enough for them  to want to play with again 
but what a horrible message to give kids if you fall from other girls good graces completely change everything about yourself in the hopes theyll like you 
so instead lets say barbies transformation is the result of an existential crisis over a lack of selfidentity
but how would that work when clearly barbie is surrounded by friends and living her best life every day why would anyone that happy and content about everything want to change
this is a reach but what if we lay the blame on the patriarchy
but thats inconceivable in dreamland barbies already rule the world the only guy around is ken and his only reason for existing is to shower barbie with affection and adoration hes like the dream boyfriend attentive and available whenever barbie needs him the guy literally has no life of his own
no problem well dress loveable ken in dbag outfits and turn him into  a selfish smothering ahole boyfriend in fact well make all the kens dbags
but why would we do that
because we cant very well say barbies metamorphosis is due to abuse and mistreatment from other females can we besides metoo is so on trend
but its completely out of character for ken it doesnt make any sense
of course it doesnt make any sense but if we sprinkle in a couple empowering monologues here and there  i promise  the women will feel so heard that they wont even notice  
please just hear me out we realize little girls think barbie is an outdated pretentious bore 
so barbie embarks on this existential journey where she gets treated like crap and cries a lot
but what ifwhat if at the end of the movie what barbie learns is that she is perfect just the way she is and she shouldnt have to change to be liked  and rhea pearlman will sit her down and tell her  youre not stereotypical my dear barbie you are the original
now wouldnt that be a far more empowering message to give kids

the truth is while the surfacelevel feminism portrayed in the movie was not at all news to me as those were reflections that fall under the been there done that long ago category for me it was still an inherently fun and lighthearted movie

and that shallow show of feminism and enpowerment while obvious to me is unfortunately not so for many

many women felt liberated by the messages in the movie as they were not fortunate to have been educated to critically think about their societal roles as i have been many men could be further exposed to the other side of the coin and further the conversation on how toxic masculinity is harmful for them as well which in my opinion was the strongest message of the movie as most men do not want to hear that

many women sadly felt attacked and misrepresented and felt the need to come to the defence of the patriarchy proof of how hard it can be for them to break free of those expectations even today and many more men felt disgusted bothered or even offended by the movie
but that in itself is testimony to how we as a society are unfortunately still far from a real universal understanding of feminism how important it is to slowly feed this information to the mainstream public and i think this movie does a good job at that

i think verily makes a lot of good pointsespecially about the factories and the capitalism involved in barbies very existence and the consumerism it encourages although as a mom who has had two children heavily invested in american girl i can say with confidence born of experience that they do it too and at a much higher price point than barbie and the way the board is portrayed

that said i feel like i saw a different movie i would venture the fact that im easily twenty years older played a key factor glorias speech spoke to my life experience under the patriarchy from the late 70s through today and for many women my age and older in particular as well as the younger viewers this may have been their first exposure to someone verbalizing itseeing it play out in the movie it is feminism 101 for someone like me who has been self educating for decades  but for someone else it may be mind blowing it had no obligation to go deeper or to portray patriarchy at allit couldve been a messageless movie

id like to revisit verilys comment about the line where barbie is feeling body conscious and helen mirren says in voiceover that margot robbie is maybe not the right person to deliver this message it can be read a few ways the first is how verily verbalized it the second is the commentary that if someone like margot who is objectively the ideal western white image of beauty a the patriarchy disrupts every womens body confidenceimage and b if even barbie feels that way it helps validate my own body consciousness and c whether a or b is true maybe i can challenge my body imagedysmorphia

re the board though yes theyre wacky goons but its an all male board and the real mattel board has just two women both in more traditional roles like communications so its both satire and a critique of the fact that mattel is run by men and that to some extent the ways that barbie expresses feminism is run through male opinions before it hits the market place see the skipper doll from the 70s whose arm you turned to give her boobs

i could go on but i think that when were talking about the movie i think we need to take a few considerations into account number oneyou cant please everyone number twoits a comedy and exaggerates reality so sometimes a joke is a joke mojo dojo casa house number threewomen of different ages are going to get very different things out of it my gen alpha daughter didnt feel any emotional attachment to glorias speech because shes on a different journey a gen x woman like my grew up in the era where we were told we could be anything but what he learned was that we have to be everything and im going to have a different read than someone in their thirties twenties sixties what have you

though i will say how you understand the film does depend on your own interpretation in the movie the kens decided to take barbieland and turn it into kendom  their home but now ruled by the patriarchy and to be honest i believe the kens had a justified reason to want to do so they were thrown to the sidelines as the barbies shined the kens having no personality or identity of their own whatsoever they took it too far however brainwashing the barbies and making them objects that see to their every whim

at the end of the movie the barbies end up taking back barbieland it is made clear that the kens dont like being in the shadow of the barbies and they reach a compromise when the main barbie margot robbie tells the main ken ryan gosling that the kens dont have to be in the shadows that they can and should discover their own interests and identities separate from the barbies so that they can get to shine just as much as the barbies  so they can be equal

i think what the writers were trying to do is show that women in the real world are like the kens in barbieland and that women just like the kens need to be given the opportunity to shine albeit in some parts of the world more than others 

i dont think that the barbie movie was bashing men or trying to bring them down in any way shape or form i think that they were trying to tell the audience and the world by extension that we are on the right track with equality between the sexes but that were just not quite there yet",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGSUdsK2Y_nlpOa_Ax3c7Q,0.9592,positive,True

you made the point brilliantly that the marketing of feminism is to pretend to do something about it while supporting the very system that perpetuates it 

plastic feminism is a new term for me and it makes so much sense 

while the owners are laughing all the way to the bank creating icons that persuade people to spend money while falsely believing the money they spend changes anything

i like how you said  if you hate netfix purchase netflix for anti netfix content 

the makers dont care why you buy as long as you give them your money 

having you buybfake symbols of what you whole so you will false satisy yiur deire fir what you want without getting it so you think you are in the game when you are looking in from the outside but still influenced to gove your mobey away to the false promise feeling closer but not any closer 
maybe that is why it is called the pursuit of happiness intead of the real thing again why coke is called the real thing when it is giving away your money to get rotten teeth and a leaky gut all the while telling yourself that you bought the real thing maybe the real thing is not purchasable maybe you are it while you continue to be convinced to look for it and purchase it outside of yourself all to keep you working to get money in order to buy what you dont really want searching for a life that is already yours while you are influenced to give it away 

so maybe a good question to ask is  no matter what it is that i am buying who in the end is getting my money

the ironic thing is that i think barbie actually did have a few genuinely interesting things to say about gender in that ken was a quite leftfield portrayal of men under the patriarchy  the idea of women being something men struggle to define themselves without and their need for that definition being a driving factor of patriarchy is interesting which is good filmmaking but is also kind of an implicit slap in the face because when all is said and done the most interesting character by far in a greta gerwig barbie movie is the male lead",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaUniPASKVCZ77T9FHqu-iA,0.9873,positive,True

i immediately overthought this movie sorry and wanted to share my thoughts as well

first off despite the obviousness and surfacelevel feminism of america ferrarras speech i recognize the importance of it being stated so plainly as its a good intro to these ideas but that reminder of where were at in society annoyed me in itselfhow many babysfirst feminism movies do we need before it becomes too obvious to say and when will movie makers 1 be able to go deeper without needing to be so palatable and 2 stop being lauded as doing something when theyve just brushed the surface 

i never expcted barbie to be a feminist masterpiece but the movie couldve been about anything and they chose a feminist theme you couldnt ignore if you wanted to and i didnt love the way those themes were executed 

spoilers my main problem was with ken me personally i couldve done with less of him but i understand he was an important part of this plot what really bugged me is that the resolution involves barbie apologizing to ken for making him feel unimportant and encouraging him to find selfactualization or whatever but none of the kens apologize or face any repercussions for brainwashing the barbies into being subservient and kicking the main barbie out of her house i feel like i needed way more context for how kens are treatedbecause nothing about their treatment came close to how women are treated in the real world except being excluded from certain careersgovernment etc which none of them showed interest in until the end anyway like not even a throwaway comment of ken could never be president or even a hint of barbies making the kens feel intentionally unimportant or stupid anything to better portray kens as being lesserthan in this society wouldve helped me swallow his plot better how i read it is that barbie treats ken as just a friend and he sees that as reason to brainwash barbieland so he could be in charge hello the parallel between kens and reallife women was so weak 

alsoooo if their world is a reflection of how theyre played with in our world its not even the barbiesfault that kens dont play a key role in society and apparently dont have houses so barbie apologizing while ken moped in her bed after his failed coup really rubbed me the wrong way

and as mentioned in the video sashas speech at the beginning about barbie being so terrible for women felt like such a hollow criticism that a teenager wouldnt actually make criticism personal to sasha as a character wouldve been better than a regurgitated twitter thread from 2013 for a second i thought she was gonna go in on the whiteness of barbie and how that affected her growing up but of course that would be a bit too real for a movie from mattel

besides small jokes like the flow of commerce quip the primary means by which i believe the subtext lends itself to cynicism is the implication of the dynamic between barbieland and real world if barbieland is a cartoonish reflection of the real world and barbieland is blatantly said to be over idealized and controlled in some part by mattel what is the implication of the kendom a foolishly optimistic and idealized reversal of barbielands plastic matriarchy brought in from the real world by some high school library books seems to me to be indirectly criticizing the plastic feminism which it presents the kendom is fragile and brought down easily because it subsists on aesthetic posturing if you were to apply this to the real world where plastic feminism is genuinely presented the implication is clear equality between the sexes doesnt occur because actual feminism isnt the goal by presenting the kens as an abstracted version of women under patriarchy in the real world we may remove ourselves from real world struggle of sexism and see the structural integrity of barbies presented feminism for what it is plastic products to consume

mattel never goes away its never clearly said but i believe that the only reason things progress in the minor way they do is because mattel sees what has happened as profitable and ultimately not making any legitimate impact on patriarchical structures

thats a very loose and brief blurb but i really do think theyre doing something with this film although i dont and will not expect much discussion on it anytime soon the conservative propaganda worked many do not like the surface level presentation but perhaps it can drive sympathizers towards considering the sexist struggle through different lenses",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBEEcL_x4ibaXun8paquMmA,0.2762,positive,True

 then barbie enter the real world with ken  where men want to hurt barbie for being femme and ken is so emotionally immature  still wanting to dominate  instead of having actual connection  but because he is suppose to be a little girls fantasy what he really wants to dominate is riding a horse  or maybe befriend a horse who knows  or the horse is a manly cowboy freedom symbol of him breaking free of barbie  but its also funny because little girls like horsies  and this man man likes horsies i did think it was adorable when i watched it so no shame for loving this scene  but i am just trying to peel it apart
anyway somewhere along ken liberates himself through patriarchy and learns to cry he says that in the movie its okay to cry kensays barbie   i know i liberated myself he replies even though patriarchies values is not included any other emotion than anger and pride  and also is creating a toxic invorenment where people are punished for crying to the extent that it kills some people each year

but i really loved the film it was meant for a larger audience including children and people who had loved barbie growing up and considering the amount of rightwing misogyny in the states right now it felt bold to even be mentioning these subjects in a big blockbuster its also a comedy and doesnt take itself too seriously so everything in the movie had multiple layers to peel through and think about afterwards it mostly made me think about the idea of barbie vs the capitalist mattel toy and the ways in which women all have some shared experiences we should talk about more 

i think that greta gerwigs genius is that her movies are way more complex than we give them credit for even the example of little women mentioned in the essay is misunderstood by many louisa may alcott the author of little women hated how women had to conform to societal standards she never married and having based her characters loosely on herself and her sisters she wished for jo to not marry but she got so much pressure to make her character marry laurie that she decided to have him marry amy and created a middleaged quite unattractive romantic interest with a thick accent for the protagonist just to shut people up gerwigs ending gives us this double illusion in which fiction meets reality and we dont fully know which is which if jo gets married or if thats only her book its subtly meta and an ode to alcott barbie in the same way found the real humanity behind the plastic and i loved that

we can criticize mattel as much as we want and i would have wished for them to be less involved but i dont think that it takes away from the beauty of the film i think a lot of women needed to feel heard

im also saddened that the entire plot is about gender dichotomy when it could be about so much more constructive and interesting topics connected to the barbie phenomenon diving deeper into the midge or growing up skipper how if the dolls in barbieland reflect how they are played with in the real world they would actually look  probably less box fresh and with more limbs missing or how theyre made or what their true origin is
and sadly the message for girls and women the message that many will walk away with is that men are silly stupid mean and useless and deserve to be discriminated against ha take that men sorry i meant of course take that patriarchy
the movie feels vengeful and that seems less than a constructive message
also it hammers in the defeatism that patriarchy in the real world is just how things work and all girls should grow up knowing they never have a real chance in getting anywhere or find happyness better then to escape into the toy world and take out your frustration on the alans and kens but of course  you need to buy them to do that",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1jYwEr-KjALN0HFuNedS-w,0.736,positive,True

but i fully disagree with you i think queer movements have it right in the sense that we dont attribute all the responsibility of a movement to a single entity or understand it as a monolithic understanding of the world with this im saying that not every feminist speech must include everything about feminism its about the roots it can create

pretending or demanding that every presentation of a movement should be equally deep or equally toned is in my opinion a very north american way to see the world and avoid discussing the nuances of each different public

on the gbv in the factories  for instance one of the thing put up in place was a branch to receive sexual harrassmentviolence complaints which opening hours were afyer everyone had started their day until before everyone had finished a few minutes walk necessary to go there and the workers had to do it during their 10 mn break which made the whole thing impossible but hey on paper theres this thing right  

for the 2020 report mattel gave out a response saying they were going to do an audit with a neutral ngo they already do audits to review their factories but with an audit firm made of toys companies oh but hey its an audit right 
its been almost three years we havent heard of mattel ever since this independent no ones ever heard of said ngo audit  might as well never had happened

now i agree that the consumerist approach is just massively distasteful and honestly gross and when speaking of the movie to a friend i said i loved the movie but i hate the fact that at the end of the day i checked after who runs the company now a days andta da it was men
with that said however there were actually pretty good moments in the film that made me happy like when barbie talks about sympathising with ken and then gets told what no he literally stole your house or the patriarchy and treatment of kens in the movie being so ridiculous it does a good job at invoking anger in misogynists that can then be appropriately and obviously pointed out by the public while i cannot truthfully speak or reflect on the effect this had on women all my girl friends actually felt really validated by that is it frontline feminism no is it a satirical caricature of the patriarchy that doesnt take itself too seriously because it tries to create some conversation around the topic while also being self aware enough to say hey we know this isnt the solution but we are working with what weve got maybe i thought so
at least i think that from greta gerwig perspective its a pretty good conversation starter and a movie that does a pretty good job at having a good feminist message what im trying to say is that personally i think that the issue is more with mattel that with greta yes shes playing a part in the system but from that perspective doing a pretty good job while naturally mattel are being horrible and using it for profit point is i think shes aware
this really doesnt make any of youre points less valid in any way i wholeheartedly agree i just think im okay calling the movie good in its feminist message while actively avoiding buying anything that is related to it
i actually had more distaste for the feminist monologues in the movie that to me failed to uphold the message even within the forum the movie was operating in

when i look at things like these i can also see the same as much as i want a better urban enviroment denying myself of actually desingning spaces will not change that so i am forced to work just like i like to believe greta wants to make feminist movies but making a true feminist movie will push her work into oblivion most probably the thing is even with this clear obligation of working against your beliefs or bending them even when you can say no just to be able to participate at all cannot be solved by working with the system in power however fighting it will also get you excluded from that space

many architects that had beliefs of more equal cities ended up only serving the necessities of the elites and then the housing market later on their work always to expensive to the normal person their interventions always to distant from the reality of the place the same goes with a lot of professions you might hate consumer culture but if you are in sales you have to sale you can critique media and powerful people on media but you still need to bend to their rules depending on which level of visibility you stand fighting against an opressive system will get you blackmailed other times you are not important enough to be listened and excluded but what im getting at is that people want to change but they know or think they cant change the system from within anymore and they are scared of being kicked out of the system by fighting it without having changed anything

barbie gives me a better message than i was expecting however it does not go into deep problems that it could probably touch i feel that the movie is good enough to exist without being pure corporate media but it cannot also fully call itself political without looking hypocritical since it avoied touching so many topics i guess greta is still in the belief that she can change the system from within either that or she just likes pretending to care about feminism which is something i doubt i will guess that in the future she will have either completly bent down to the will of hollywood and corporations and her political activism inside her media and art will be seen only as fake as mattels is seen in this video or she will eventually be seen less and less in this level of fame

also in regards to the jokes about possible criticisms i personally didnt see it as trying to absolve themselves from the criticisms but as a way to acknowledge they exist and be self aware being self aware doesnt equate excusing the problem imo also barbie can never not be a product it literally being a product so in my eyes being self aware is the only thing they really could do

64328,@menswxvr1030,26/7/2023,19:47:53,0,"i really enjoyed the barbie movie when i saw it and was impressed by how it handled a lot of the subject matter in the movie i wont lie there were definitely a couple points in the movie that made me shed a tear growing up i didnt play with barbie as much as i played with breyer horses legos lincoln logs little people and dollhouse people i was much more of an american girl doll fan which is now owned by mattel but didnt get one until i was bit older because they were quite expensive but loved and read all the books i never had a good image of barbie as my mom was never a fan of them for a lot of reasons pointed out in this video and she passed that on to me my family tends to be on the thicker side and has a lot of body image issues for a variety of reasons and barbie was kind of a representation of what we could never live up to that being said i had friends and family members who did love playing with barbie and dolls in general so i know there is a genuine love there 

i personally feel like the movie took a pretty nuanced approach of the image of barbie and just as a movie was well written casted and directed im quite pleased to see some nuanced criticism about the movie that talks about the dark side of mattel as well whats kind of wild to me though is i know people who are like wow the movie was so political they mentioned the patriarchy a bunch and are kinda uncomfortable about it so i feel like if the movie had gone to a deeper level it may have alienated people cough cough men cough cough who havent really given a lot of thought to these things of course i dont think this movie is the end all be all of things but considering how heavily and unfairly things made by women women leading in etc are scrutinized by literally everyone i think its a good place to start for people who havent really considered much about what its like to be a women at least in america and at the end of day it was a pretty fun watch especially with your girl friends and family and its cool to see a very pink and girly film being taken seriously

i also do agree with some of the comments about wanting to see a bit more overt lgbtq rep in the movie but to be fair the movie never seemed to be about sexuality but rather gender and gender roles being a woman and self actualization so im personally not to bothered by it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8mKe34JMURB4XoNNw8j0vg,0.9977,positive,True

its often like this when i see a so called feminist movie now it feels like the creators made a check list of feminism stuff to put in their movies but without any depht and in the end its always about a pretty white girl or an awesome white dude and if they change the tapestry a bit the structure stays the same well at least i cant say im surprised i wasnt delusional to the point of thinking i would see a revolutionnary movie about feminism

one was barbie realizing that life is beautiful every stage of life is beautiful and should be celebrated also no matter how you look no matter youre a fat barbie or an old woman you can still feel confident and happy in your skin yeah they made fun of barbie getting cellulite but she gladly embraced being human at the end of the movie cellulite and everything included
another one was that very summarized speech from the mom i dont remember her name about how people in general expect women to act that hit hard even though my gf who came watch it with me rolled her eyes hard to clarify she hasnt experienced the same misogyny i have so i dont blame her however i felt a tiny bit hurt for the lack of understanding ive also felt like a piece of meat to men eyes like when barbie skates in the real world
also it clearly portrayed what any kid has done with their dolls you ask for the barbies not for the kens and if you get a ken you dont play with him as much its a girl night every night because kids that age dont care that much about romance and getting a partner they want to play with their friends and men and ken come in second place

64457,@VioletteLundsten,26/7/2023,5:52:58,1,"super long response 
the barbie movie is an advert for barbie products that is why it exists it is a commercial endeavour so its feminism or promotion of girl power is going to be limited by this fact if its message doesnt make money for mattel and warner bros then it will not be in the final cut

all this said i do wonder if the movie and barbie brand cannot do some good alongside this barbie did a youtube vlog about frida kahlo presumably exposing thousands of girls to kahlo that otherwise would not have been aware i do not think it is unreasonable to suppose that at least one of those girls may have been inspired to pursue more knowledge and experience in art due to this video mattel makes these videos and the kahlo barbie doll in order to be a more profitable company a company that has a good feminist vibe this is doubtlessly true however does this mean they can do no good

the world is screwed we know this to be true and the barbie movie agrees explicitly so the movie urges us to keep our chins up and push on anyway barbie hasnt solved feminism single handedly but cant we love her anyway yes shes a plastic face to a faceless corporate machine but can she not still speak to me pikachu has been selling me products and services for most of my life does that mean i cant love pikachu i cant be inspired by the plucky optimism and energy of the pokemon trainers i grew up with that i put myself into the shoes of barbie brings light and sparkle to my life shes a tool of capitalism but what in my life isnt

i wonder if verilybitchie is supposing that the barbie movie is robbing us of grassroots nonprofit feminism somehow that its glossy and airbrushed girl power somehow removes motivation for real girls and women to stand together and push for real change push to improve treatment in stem jobs and secure bodily autonomy rights if so i cannot see how this could be true perhaps we as a population might be fooled into buying barbie instead of pushing for real change in the world as we step out of cinemas i find that on a very basic level a movie of this popularity so openly discussing and opposing patriarchy can only serve to raise consciousness in the population for boyfriends and fathers to be exposed to the journey of ken to be so openly marginalised in the barbie world as women have been in the real world being able to say that the ideas the barbie movie promotes are mainstream ideas is a good thing to point to it and say yes this is normal to have little kids watching barbie on repeat 100s of times like i did with the little mermaid and aladdin in the original versions of those movies i wanted to be jasmine and ariel i wanted a tiny waist and a voluptuous bust like they did i related most to characters that had much of their agency robbed from them i had this model of womanhood drummed into me for the little ones of today to have this version of barbie drummed into them i can only see that as progress

is this enough well obviously not but why would we expect it to be is it better than any other major blockbuster in recent years for feminist consciousness raising hell yes it is so why then would we be disappointed what did we even want or we went in knowing wed hate it and we came out vindicated yay

mattel is not going to usher in a feminist revolution because that probably would not be profitable but that doesnt justify deep criticism of barbie while the detective pikachu movie starring ryan renolds went by with little to no criticism of its feminism while being at least as much of an advert for pokemon products and services

barbie is a brand that says being unapologetically girly and proud of it is normal great and in no way suggests you are any lesser than someone less girly be they male or female when i grew up boys would mock barbies because they were girly that was enough but today more and more of them simply see barbie and girly things as not always their cup of tea but perfectly legitimate barbie says you dont need to be like a boy to be a powerful independent person that message has power and still needs to be said it still needs to be said that a pretty girly girl is not a slut not a bimbo were just people our expression of personhood is not an invitation for suspicion and criticism

verilybitchie glosses over the 1997 aqua hit barbie girlas being critical of plastic surgery and beauty standards and this is why mattel disliked it however aquas hit song labels a plastic dress up fashion doll for children as a bimbowith such choice lyrics as you can brush my hair undress me everywhereand i can act like a star i can beg on my kneestaking the patriarchal and femmephobic attitudes of the time and applying them to a doll in the shape of a young woman we might ask why we are specifically reminded that we can undress barbie rather than that we can also undress ken or indeed classic gi joe toys far from feminist aquas catchy hit was a reflection of normalised mockery and sexualisation of conventional femininity a product sold on the back of edgy 90s misogyny im calling you a slut objectifying you and expecting you to smile along but its ok because we both know im doing it ironically right now keep wiggling your tits for the camera hun so i can get paid but because it wasnt good for mattels brand its suddenly a ok is it

heck the barbie movie explicitly calls out the need for further change in the distribution of power between men and women in the world it explicitly tells us that the work is not done and wont be done by mattel

honestly this critique is so hollow to me the barbie movie is not perfect for example the concept that the barbies were so vulnerable to patriarchy is underdeveloped and i think it has interesting and potentially difficult implications if those concepts were further delved into it is not clear if any of the barbies feel romantic love or not whether that is for a ken or for a barbie or potentially to humans our main barbie being made a real girl and not loving her ken is probably very wise but it does leave her feelings ambiguous this is not a problem per se but i suppose my point is that she seems to have little to any drive outside of helping her girlthat plays with her now as a human she is still very much a blank slate i suppose i would have liked for her to have some form of personal interest or passion if only hinted at briefly

i grew up with a very feminist mother born in the 60s the way she brought us up was actually very anti feminin i grew up with the idea that it was somehow bad to be girly to want to wear pink dresses or care about your looks
 it was very freeing to me to realise you can wear a short pink dress and glittery high heels no matter your gender and be just as feminist so i loved that everyone at the premier dressed up all pink and girly i think this symbolised a shift away from the idea that women have to become more like men in order to be treated equal",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBlQIVnFg85_CitpZRb4qg,0.9493,positive,True

meaning that in loads of ways we are entirely dependant on these watered down versions of feminism to actually progress in feminism we are dependant on those who arent oppressed by the systen to fight against the oppression from the inside and thus we need spaces for them where we have a conversation thats not too harsh so it alienates them

im not saying that i think the barbie movie was a feminist leap of revolution however it is definitely a pretty big step for feminism in the right direction not for people who already have done the work to educate themselves about feminism but for all those who havent 

its so easy to long for actual deep conversations of meaning about feminism when you submerse yourself in it every day however havent we all wished that it was easier to talk to those around us of feminism in a way that didnt turn into a fight

the biggest surprise to me about the movie has been the fact that it is a blockbluster hit that people have taken seriously that doesnt happen for movies advertised to women especially ones that are so openly feminine half the theater was decked out in pick including men playing with barbies like other feminine stuff is both expected and derided in women my girlfriend and i had opposite experiences as children she hated being expected to play with barbies and rejected them i loved playing with them and hated being shamed for having girly interests for both of us it felt freeing to engage with something feminine without that atmosphere of shame 


also its true that anything geared toward women gets more heavily scrutinized than anything geared toward men im not saying this to discourage critiques mattel is not a good company its just that anything that women do get held to higher standard which is part of what they talked about in the movie just the idea of a girl boss is part of this women ceos get disproportionate blame for their companiesfailures than men do by a lot we should critique girl boss feminism but we have to be mindful of how these critiques often turn into just shaming women while ignoring men

so this is yet another analysis of yours that hits the spot i always appreciate how many topics you bring to light surrounding your main message and how efficiently you put it",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOH1shYhQqMQ1sv393Is-iA,0.9512,positive,True

i want to give the movie credit and believe that this was the satirical point they were trying to make selfactualization as distraction from systemic problems but i genuinely cannot tell if thats what the film creators intended",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIHrkRKXVWIq88LZixNTFg,-0.6297,negative,True

another symptom of this movies white feminism leaking through to me is that joke at glorias husband attempt to learn spanish which just comes off meanspirited to me why would you mock something that wholesome ffs the man wants to better his communication with his wife and child wouldnt catch me out here shaming my partner for trying to learn vietnamese more importantly aside from that joke gloria and sasha just sound like two whitest women you can think of how is that the only signifier of their cultural identity

also doesnt the existence of the patriarchy rely on the grounds that men have always had power and women exist as an afterthought and have to depend on its benevolence by that logic isnt the barbies the patriarchy in barbieland barbies are the ones who have jobs who are in high offices who own properties the kens are assigned as barbies accessories they dont own houses because every house is barbies dreamhouse they have no executive power they have to rely and compete for scraps of barbies affections if anything the kens are the marginalised powerless group in this world they have more in common with reallife women than the barbies including the fact that the barbies are diversely cast but the kens only consist of one allowed body type and even as i like the deconstruction of a redpilled ken does it really work when the character never really have a perceived entitlement fed to him by society in the first place like gerwig tried to describe the kentakeover as evil monstrous brainwashing with the worst symptoms of toxic masculinity and needs to be shut down which feels too much of an easy way out for me when it could have been that ken found politicalconciousness in the real world reinterpreted it and used it to help fellow kens gain more equality in barbieland would have been wayy more interesting if that line about him thinking the patriarchy is about horse have been taken more seriously imo instead they framed it in this milquetoast take thats really fucking stagnant when you put it in context the kens can rebel yes but not too much not too confrontational of the system because then they would just take over it and it will be baaad that depogramming speech gloria gave the barbies would have applied much better with the kens in the context of their world and also the motivation for kens rebellion is just that hes an incel like i like that ryan ken and margot robbie reconcile and address their failings at the end and that barbie acknowledges that she has been a pretty shitty friend to him but the rest still rings very hollow",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyHSU3kx35FszbCsWfv7n9w,0.9758,positive,True

i immediately bristled 
the color purple is a story about a black woman in the early 1900s in america who does not believe she is descended from royalty most black americans have no way of accessing their familial lineage thanks to slavery she is told at every turn that she has no worth as a child the only person who loves her is her sister nettie who is then taken away from her its a story about celie finding her worth and about how hard a black woman in that era had to fight to have a sense of worth more specifically celie learns that she deserves love just because without having to earn it and that love from nettie is the first thing in her life that affirms that 
but the trailer immediately takes that and says no you have worth because youre a princess like a disney princess isnt that greatafter seeing the color purple get disney princessified in a trailer it was actually pretty good to see barbie a figure whose worth has always been separated from motherhood marriage and familial lineage is it crass capitalism to sell little girls dolls and say this is feminism well of course but girls like to play with dolls parents are going to buy them dolls and i cant believe im saying this as a girl who preferred my star wars toys and despised barbie butbetter that it should be barbie than a toy that assigns a girl a womans role lets not get it twisted every single thing here is capitalism making a musical of the color purple and turning that musical into a movie is also capitalism ive got far fewer problems with a pink toy aisle full of barbies that have numerous options of who they can be in life than i do with you know what makes you valuable being a member of a familial line that the state recognizes as royalty",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipSxB2YCfktvmeCwYs2hsA,0.951,positive,True

i was pretty emotionally investet even before seeing the movie because as a kid i was always made fun of for liking girly things like the animated barbie movies in the last years i tried to heal this by openly loving pink and the old barbie movies and many feminine coded things so i had the expectations that this new barbie movie would lean into that my bad i guess instead barbie stopped wearing pink by the end of the movie i felt judged by the barbie movie for dressing pink to see a barbie movie because even barbie doesnt wear pink as she becomes a real human that was probably not the intention but it hurt nontheless 
that and the lack of intersectionality are my main criticism but there are many many choices that could have easily been made to make a more feminist film

however i would argue that the movie does have its merits the palatability might help spread awareness of just how important feminism is however hollow it may be in this movie also its really funny and its nice with a little bit of respite from the doomerism always creeping up from behind haha 

feminism has to be radical intersectional and uncompromising but i think a large number of people are so unused to the radical concepts and language of feminism that they cringe away from it without giving it a second thought heck they may even oppose it very vocally as an automatic response while problematic and genuinely harmful the palatable feminism of greta gerwigs barbie may be i think it might also serve as a pipeline to make a wider audience more receptive to actual feminist ideas its paradoxical i know but then again what isnt

i do think that it may do more harm than good though the last thing we need right now is a boom in unethical production of super environmentally and socially detrimental products  this might just be me trying to cope with my crippling climate anxiety  but like its an ambivalent issue but ambivalent is at least a little bit better than 100 bleak right i really hope it is

i think the barbie movie would have been better if it was focused on barbie and ken being overwhelmed by the multilayered complexity of human life irl and the message was about retaining hope in a world bent on crushing it seeking out the joys of imaginative childhood comforts and balancing realism with emotional support fantasies and stories not feminism that supports the idea of the barbie doll in a 2 hour fun movie im sorry if the movie actually did cover this i havent seen it

however i disagree about what the film is and what it was made to be from the point of view of mattel and wb it sure is an opportunity to make huge bank from the point of view of the filmmakers it feels like a few things firstly a story about identity one that i found incredibly moving as a trans person despite nonbinary identities being ignored and the existing trans representation in the film not being commented on at all but also an opportunity to use a brand name that will get the movie seen by a lot of people to make a film that serves as a potential first point of contact with a lot of complex topics they dont have time to approach with complexity

i dont see the small moments as get out of jail cards i see them as small wedges for inviting young people to look deeper into it patriarchy is talked about a lot obviously but mentions of how colonisers caused plagues on turtle island white saviours construction guys being like yeah cool whatever about barbies lack of the expected type or amount of genitals these moments arent all successful or subtle but they do a lot of heavy lifting in a few seconds

i would definitely not say the ceo and his board members were lovable or even likeable the performances were fun but the characters were concerned with profit over anything else and are constantly made a joke of i would say the the buffoonery allows the audience to see them as goofy sillybillies and thus more harmless which is exactly how we ended up with boris johnson as pm and that would be a fair criticism but again it was a movie that needed the signoff from the very people it was criticising

and therein lies its problem of course but also what makes it work i dont think it would have anywhere near the same capacity for creating change if it was a movie about a bella doll and the evil corporation creating it its the old do you want a pure message with no compromise or a greater capacity for broader impact problem of activism or social commentary i dont think theres a right answer there and i dont think that you couldnt make the fauxbarbie movie and have it have impact but i do believe that even with a more diluted message barbie is going to create a lot of really interesting and a lot of exhausting conversations and discourse outside of environments that are used to this kind of discourse",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYHku6kx84IoFnLGlJjIE7Q,0.9836,positive,True

maybe it depends on what kind of media youve been watching but feminism tends to be focused on all these grand changes the big lifechanging injustices between genders and while of course im in favour of fighting these its not like they are the norm in the western world nowadays ive never gotten paid explicitly less because of my gender because its fixed for everyone ive never had my chastity fiercely guarded by the men in my family never been denied to vote own things etc
i can celebrate all these achievements and be thankful for them but they dont really capture all the small injustices that remain all the pentup frustrations and cognitive dissonances of modern women that are supposed to be everything the perfect career woman and mother and girlfriendwife and daughter etcand the movie summed them up so damn well those everyday experiences and gendered expectations and different treatments from others it felt so good to justactually feel understood a piece of media that didnt deny that there were still issues while also focusing on the small things that are much more universal than the big issues that have become rare now

does the movie ever really go anywhere with it no 
but does it have to in the end the barbies fix barbieland by putting the barbies back in charge and overthrowing the patriarchy but its not like that does anything for reality and one could accuse the movie of lacking a real goal in that regard but what was it supposed to do singlehandedly fix all feminist problems in the world its a freaking doll  isnt that asking a bit much from a toy

barbieland is the way it is and gets restored to that state because it is a place that represents girls dreams no matter how commodified it makes them its still true that the way little girls play with barbie is a form of selfexpression of exploring their own interests and options my own barbie didnt like her ken very much she ended up living with another female doll instead and coraising two daughters with her because thats what felt right to me long before i knew about samesex attraction my barbie was an author because i wanted to be one even though there was no set for that that could be bought at the time my barbie struggled with some things because i decided that shed struggle with that she was troubled by her period even if mattel created the dolls without reproductive organs and so on

    what i really want is to watch it on mute for the aesthetics and then steal whatever will work for me  maybe wear more pink and such  i think i keep going after being cool even in my mid30s wanting to live the life all that joyous colorful fabric suggests  maybe chasing the trappings partially keeps me moving and able to go after deeper things but i also feel it pulling me down as im getting to a size thats a lot harder to play that game with  lately sometimes im failing at being the inspirational joyful princess success and feel a deep ache about growing out of cherished clothes  its a plastic doll world i just live in it  thank god for empire waistlines and good friends  maybe my friend will make the barbie movie fun for me  maybe ill crochet a pink mesh sweater",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAHHMYRaZQflmAR1-0Kx1SQ,0.9975,positive,True

64731,@ChelCM03,25/7/2023,4:10:42,568,"ive loved barbie ever since i was a little girl i remember getting my first barbie and dreamhouse for christmas when i was 4 at christmas i really really really enjoyed the movie i thought it was fun theatrical full of heart and a proper homage to barbies history 
but i totally understand that this movie wasnt this big feminist masterpiece barbie like literally everything nowadays is a brand every tv series and movie is to sell tickets and merch media corporations just want more money although barbie was definitely made with waaaaaaaay more love and care than any of disneys recent live action remakes no one asked for or any movie based on an already existing property it doesnt escape this problem 
however where the movie lacks in feminist ideals i feel like the barbie movie does a way better job at talking about toxic masculinity and how harmful it is to both men and women barbie experiencing sexual harassment and assault in the real world was jarring for her she never experienced men being so disrespectful to her before meanwhile ken finally feels respected in barbieland the kens dont have much if any power and ken felt like he wasnt being respected by barbie he goes to the real world and see men dominating the work force and athletics and stuff and he finally feels understood and validated then when he brings the patriarchy to barbieland he does it to lash out at barbie he yells you failed me in anger and frustration cause he didnt feel respected 
the barbie movie is a much better commentary on how toxic masculinity is harmful and often a result of men being hurt and humiliated young boys find solidarity in the red pill community because their feelings are validated and as a result they lash out at women when the problem is their own standards ken brought all these specific rules for behavior because he thought it would earn barbies respect but at the end of the movie ken says it was hard being a leader and hes embarrassed to cry in front of barbie when she then tells him its okay she apologizes to him 
a lot of people have said if this was truly a feminist movie then barbieland should have been equal for barbies and kens and all i have to say is that it wasnt the point the narrator even says and soon one day the kens will have just as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world like thats the joke its satire kens not having much power in barbieland is a direct comparison to our world and how women still need to fight to be treated with respect in 2023 thats the point of that ending 
i could also say that the barbie movie does a much better job at telling men and women you dont need to do everything in order to be worthy of respect simply existing as a human being should be enough and there are many people happy with being ordinary and thats okay stereotypical barbie didnt want to be extraordinary she just wanted to exist she was happy doing normal things and simply being alive experiencing the wide range of human emotions being a human being is enough 
anyway that was my take on the barbie movie was it a feminist masterpiece no did it excel in other areas very much was it a fun theater experience absolutely i got dressed up and everything",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiW4-_sXslaTi6BqX_qHQNg,0.9956,positive,True

it preys on peoples nostalgia just the other day i rewatched my favourite barbie film from childhood and realized how horrible the message actually was on the surface it was a classic accept yourself story but truly it was a story where conventionally attractive female leads got married to conventionally attractive male leads while the ugly gaycoded villain got thrown in prison for trying to interrupt it you should accept yourself only if youre already beautiful enough only if you already fit the mold society forces on everyone girls can do anything unless that girl is a bit too weird a bit too masculine a bit too gay there is never going to be a masculine female barbie doll because how is barbie suposed to market rejecting gender rolesnot buying products in order to feel good about yourself

i really enjoyed the movie despite its metaissues and i think youre right on the nose about the movie being unable to be anything other than it was if the movie truly was some groundbreaking feminist anticaptalistic flick it would have felt hypocritical to me after the buzz around it encouraging shopping and fast fashion to some degree is anyone who bought a whole pink outfit for the movie despite not usually wearing pink actually going to wear it again

like there were definitely good feminist themes in the film but i feel like ive heard something exactly like glorias speech on button poetry or similar like a decade ago  when it was actually kind of groundbreaking to say and not just old news to any person who has been involved in feminist discussions not shaming anyones journey with that kind of stuff of course but i think a commentary can be made alone and how long it took for those thoughts to make it into a big movie

im not saying that art and politics are never connected because often theyre that and more but i really wish people would stop imagining that blockbusters like these are gonna do anything important a single watereddown movie is not going to break any maninpower out of his fortress of misogyny and any inspired girl is still going to have to face the same obstacles ie your stem example also more importantly every article thats like is barbie feminist and what we need right now makes me want to pull out all my teeth lol

also disclaimer that i was thinking mainly about barbie and the female characters in the movie kens arc felt kind of fanservicey to me pathetic men are all the rage  and i havent really thought about it in detail beyond that but men were not targeted financially for the movie for the most part so if there was going to be any good nonhypocritical critiques made it would have probably been made in his arc",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNE1ViXClKidN-8oGF70ag,0.9852,positive,True

for me it was the most perfect the film could have been within the constraints it had i would love if this could be the starting point for a whole new wave of people to get into feminism and for more explicit and nuanced takes on feminism to be accepted into big box office productions from a leftistinformed feminist perspective it was extremely superficial but the people i know who dont know much about politics find the inclusion of the word patriarchy alone radical

above all it did make me feel hopeful its kind of like rainbow capitalismi may criticize it but seeing that companies think this is profitable means that we are becoming mainstream antifeminist legislation be damned and being there with other people who can relate who laughed at the jokes it was just nice to feel this kind of positive community i havent had that in years

the message of woman empowerment was really nice on the surface but the way that the movie failed to really acknowledge anyones experiences aside from that of cis feminine presenting women who are conventionally attractive just made the message feel really hollow at least for us no referencing the problem in a comedic oneliner doesnt count or fix it in any way it was kind of a let down because it marketed itself as this huge feminist manifesto empowering for all women when in reality it was only meant for one specific kind of woman

i saw it with a bunch of colleagues at a companysponsored early showing those folks arent up for the complex discussion of where the film hit the mark where it fell down and why parts of it felt so shallow even as it went much deeper than i ever expected and most of my friends either havent seen it yet or are vibing with it and i dont wanna burst their bubble its not the pinnacle of feminism that some folks seem to be celebrating it as but parts of it also resonated for me and a lot of other folks and even thought its been a week i do keep thinking about itits been a long time since i kept thinking about a movie for a full week after i saw it

64920,@FerroPerson,24/7/2023,20:25:54,1371,"i had a lot of disagreement over my interpretation of the movie with my other progressive friends

when i was growing up i liked watching the animated barbie movies with my sister when i went to see the new one i had no expectations i knew it was a commercial product and that it was payrolled by mattel

but you know what i cant think on how to make a more leftist movie out of this material the facts of the matter are that barbie is for better or worse popular as hell mattel would make a movie anyway and of course they want money theyre a private company they care about their bottom line and nothing else

your criticisms of capitalism and cynicism of mattel are well warranted more needs to be done about the workers the environmental effect and the effect that these dolls have on young girls selfperception but you know what when i saw the movie i saw the only thing that could get through to my consumerist sister something that gave her things to think about a seed of sorts i think the movie is great when it comes to moving centre people over to the cause of feminism and anticapitalism and to see a company like mattel do this to me feels like a huge concession to the movement on mattels part the movie didnt for one sec consider but our world is equal no it pointed directly at the problems at least the western problems like the lack of representation lack of power and unequal employment opportunities it gives the viewers a tangible understanding of what patriarchy is which is more important to radicalize people than a century of theory and obscure books

i dont know if id call their movieceo likeable  spoilers here he tries to kidnap barbie cares only about the bottom line is against making normal barbie with normal problems at the end of the movie until the advisor says it would make moneyspoilers end here and is generally portrayed as a hypocritical clown who doesnt know anything yet is allowed to control everything sure hes portrayed somewhat sympathetically despite that but this movie is literally paid for by the real ceo theres not much more i can think of to make his image worse in this context

i am of the opinion that despite what barbie dolls really represent a lot of girls grew close to these dolls and it should be noted in the political critique of the brand its a very personal matter to many and wide proclamations that barbie bad while true may be fruitless  people who are emotionally attached to something would rather defend those things than to accept criticism a better approach is in my humble opinion to make it fun make it optimistic in the beginning offer a new way forward this way is much nicer and most importantly more productive when it comes to moving more people to the cause of feminism i really think that this is far better than the popfeminist mockery that is disneys liveaction mulan i prefer barbie over the messaging of that movie any day

and i do think theres more public support needed for feminism lately the internet has been filled with misogynists and misogynistic content while reallife conditions have probably not gotten better in europe  america wherever i look people hate on feminism which is sad it is my belief that it doesnt need to be this bad its just that the left is too preachy to effectively communicate our ideas

sorry for rambling a bit its just that i think too much about that movie lmao i concede that theres many things to be desired when it comes to this barbies politics but it is a really good movie and in my opinion in these conditions the movie couldnt be better

edit oh also i completly forgot there is like no lgbt representation in the movie which is really weird for a clearly progressive movie about all the different kinds of women this should not be skipped or forgiven",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOH9yaO7Viv_yKvCzLhKe7Q,0.9843,positive,True
64924,@packman2321,24/7/2023,20:23:50,120,"this movie was split between enjoyable and frustrating for me as you say i feel it tried to absorb every criticism and topdown argument for barbie they could find and this left its message as kind of a mash of confused stuff that still leaves barbie in the position of doing most of the emotional lifting for a ken were supposed to feel sorry for or maybe not while the real world is a mix of cynical realism and spy kids logic which was honestly a little distabilising

i think one of the things that frustrates me about the way barbie is discussed in this film is that its very topdown as if patriarchy just isnt beaten because people are too stupid to realise its there and yet the movie seems to misunderstand patriarchy as just men being in charge and misses the ways in which its solution to fight patriarchy is just more patriarchy

and thats frustrating because there are lines one could take there if they wanted to be genuinely subversive one of the reasons barbie was designed was allegedly from observing girls playing with dolls essentially ruth handler claimed she noticed girls treating their baby dolls like friends dragging them around by their feet etc and thus barbies designed to be in the spirit of fashion dolls which in prior decades were largely china or paper and thus far too fragile to play with long term normally the sort of the thing youd buy for an older girl but made durable enough to actually handle girls obviously still dont play with dolls as directed nowadays here im pulling from the chapters doll culture and barbie culture in the book girl culture the essay doll culture in the 19th century and barbies queer accessories in the childrens culture reader as proven by weird barbie given that the issues motivating barbie to leave barbieland are concerns about death body image etcetera theres a seed for real potential here challenging the sort of top down narrative of barbie as a tool that solves problems to recognise that people already use barbie as a resource to solve and create problems from the bottom up to paraphrase one of those essays barbies queer accessories barbie doesnt have meanings shes a surface onto which meanings are writen

its similarly really disappointing to see how it dealt with patriarchy since one of the most cogent critiques of the system of white capitalist heteropatriarchy is that historically no one given the option ever wants the roles of successful in the system this is a slight exaggeration but david graeber provides a solid runthrough of this problem and ive also seen the same argument made by indigenous activists setting barbie and ken as outsiders to the system who see it and are confused and uninvested in it sets up a potential for a real commentary about the issues of gender roles in patriarchy in an accessible way but the movie largely throws that away after the initial montage for an engagement in a kind of choice feminism or postfeminism where the solution is just cooption back into barbieland or cooption into the real world it uses the aesthetics of character growth largely to sidestep the criticisms that it brought up

honestly just frustrating a fun movie thats first half embraces some interesting play logic and then somehow totally misses the ability to capitalise on the exact same thing by following the implications of weird barbie or unendingthoughtsofdeath barbie or even the ken fight which im certain some children have done with their own dolls one of those sources contains stories about the trend among victorian girls for giving their dolls funerals and literally destroying them so if not were backsliding

basically its just sad to see a movie bring up play highlight the idiosyncratic nature of it in its inciting incident and then throw that to the side for a topdown narrative about how the way to become more feminist is to just play barbie in a civil human way

as someone who never played with barbies myself i know i dont have a horse in this race particularly and im honestly kind of excited to see what aggressive readings might come out of it to make more radical interpretations of the film cooption goes both ways after all but barbies history and position in culture is really interesting and the film just seemed committed to almost engaging with that and then wandering off to do something largely unrelated in a way that kind of undercut those parts",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8RY_k2cnw22NJpTc5-NrA,0.9263,positive,True

and honestly to say anything is the perfect feminist piece of art isnt actually feminist because it paints all feminist ideas and woman as a monolith im excited for the next generation of feminism that includes intersectionality and diversity rather than radical white feminism 

i also dont think that body image and feminism was the point of the movie its not about the patriarchy its not about girl power its not about her being a victim of sexism 

it was about being human and improving over time it was about not faking happinesschanging yourself to mask pain or please others

ive been let down a lot by womens rights and white feminism lately to an alarming degree i often feel excluded from or ignored in these conversations so to be honest i think if the movie had done anything you described that you had wanted i would have been mad 

it would have regurgitated the same white feminism weve seen for years that has left bipoc women and nonbinary people for years it would have been a bad movie and given further ammo to antifeminists to say that feminist ideology and feminism in film fails  

plus even if mattel sucks it doesnt mean the movie does the patriarchy was a motif and never meant to be part of the theme the theme wasnt about feminism or body image those ideas were only introduced to barbie world because of the real world 

spoiler

they had never been tainted by it before which is why they were so easily accepting of it and once they took power back none of them went back to who they were before they became truer versions of themselves

i like what you said about the male representation being akin to how women are shallowly portrayed in a lot of film history that works fine and i think its a cute tongueincheek move from gerwig so we wonder where the kens live and notice their lack of representation in government in barbieland but accept it as a nonissue because of the framing where barbie is a person but ken is an accessory but then by the point patriarchy takes over youre asked to take the kens place in society seriously ken has had nowhere to express his aesthetic emotional and aspirational needs in this society theyre purportedly sharing so barbies are oppressors then the climax of the film is focused on taking power over their world back from the kens a big structural issue with the hierarchical nature of barbieland is exposed but then resolved on a personal level with ryans ken  he needs to focus on himself and actualizing his own identity instead of wrapping his identity up in his romantic interest in barbie but like i feel thats what he was attempting to do with his whole rebellion schtick and the problem was just that he applied it on an institutional level instead of really internalizing it so the larger societywide conflict is dealt with on an individual basis  they say the personal is political but this feels like an inversion of how that typically is applied the framing makes it seem like everything is resolved ryans ken is kenough margots barbie has her own thing going on is achieving some self actualization of her own and the kens are no longer taking over the government except the film just shoved all these valid issues with the kens position and treatment and then throws out a joke that they might get a single seat on the supreme court or something along those lines i find it unsatisfying and a weird choice in my own life i think its important to recognize feminism as a means to empower all peoples rather than as a backlash against patriarchy i dont think this aspect of feminism as a force of good for men and women alike would have caused issues with mattels commercial interests so i feel gerwig maybe didnt go as far as she honestly could have in this respect 

it was kind of a weird viewing experience the costuming and set and soundtrack are all so divine but i think the story lacks internal cohesion and fails to be consistent in its messaging oppenheimer too lacked cohesion in messaging im just glad we watched barbie second because that film at least was a fun romp id certainly watch it again even though i cant ignore the problems it presents

65052,@ghostsoffishandcrows7341,17/8/2023,16:01:05,7,"i feel like in part the criticism of the barbie movie is kinda representative of some of the themes touched on in the film here we have a piece that doesnt seem like it shouldve happened it criticises the company making it and makes many jokes at its expense like im amazed mattel let half the movie slide even though i know its a corporate ploy to make them look better than they actually are by pretending to be self aware and caring about the issues i think this movie did the best it could under its circumstances under this patriarchal capitalistic society and yet its not enough the same way women are never enough unless theyre perfect and they never are almost like theyre people  barbie wasnt a perfect feminist film therefore it sucks like its better to say nothing at all than to say anything less than everything this is just gonna be word vomit as i try to work out my own thoughts on this i saw barbie on opening weekend with friends having no idea what it was supposed to be on the way there a friend told me it had something to do with barbie going in to the real world so i started joking about how she was going to still be barbie sized and it would be about how small creatures like ants live in a mostly dark world because of the way light works like i literally had no idea what it was about i just wanted to spend time with my friends so walking into this movie that was hilarious and topical and made me feel seen despite being transmasc agender and not a woman and also never really having barbies way exceeded my expectations it was just fun and exactly what i needed before watching oppenheimer another film i knew nothing about except that it was about the dude who made the nuclear bombs and he was jewish a which wasnt really important to the film i feel like that gave me a way more positive view on the film than most people since i didnt go in expecting a feminist masterpiece i was expecting like maybe friendship is magic or some basic shit like that and even though it was a very broad look at feminism it felt like a good introduction for people who didnt have much of an understanding of patriarchy and to me a teenager with a uterus watching the country right next to me take away the bodily autonomy of people like me while assholes on the internet claim that sexism doesnt exist and andrew tate is right and a very popular twitch streamer yelling about how women literally are objects it was a nice acknowledgment that im not alone and these struggles are real but we will still succeed against all odds even if people dont want us to even if we get criticised for every misstep and every sacrifice that had to be made to make it as good as possible also as an aro ace person seeing any media without a romantic subplot was fucking amazing oh my god finally im so tired of this bullshit on my second viewing with family in a small old school theatre in the middle of nowhere saskatchewan a very cool experience for a city bitch like me i was able to see a bit more of where it fell short the monologue definitely didnt hit as hard and felt kinda awkward and surface level but i think the idea behind it of proving to women that have been brainwashed as they say that they will never fully succeed under the patriarchy because the criteria for success is so contradictory is an effective way of getting people who were previously wary on board with feminism its just not a solution to misogyny also i just loved the character of alan ever member of nsynch like if you really read into it him being the only alan and therefore kinda an outcast in barbieland meant he had to come to terms with his identity and be secure in himself which made him immune to the patriarchy because he didnt need to put others down to feel like enough he was helping the barbies for his own benefit kendom land wasnt good for him either yes but he still understood that he was more privileged than the barbies he wasnt really oppressed by the other kens at least not to the same extent he just didnt feel welcome or represented and taking the hits for the barbies literally because he knew he could get away with it not agreeing with sasha and her moms whose name i forget im so bad at names decision to go back but still helping them because he knew they as in women were the only ones who could decide what was best for themselves and still supporting them idk if that makes any sense but theres just not enough alan love in the world hes totally neurodivergent and definitely not straight i cant believe all the men complaining about how the kens were represented when a good man was right there the whole time i just remembered how ken needed barbies permission and instructions to go for a walk after arriving in the real world like even though its before ken discovers patriarchy its a good representation of how sometimes men are just completely useless at normal things and need a woman to tell them what to do also also also the montage at the beginning of the barbies accepting their prizes and saying how they deserve them and they worked hard for them was so good and the woman in the court talking about how companys dont have rights and cant or else the democracy will turn into a corporatocracy and how she can be both emotional and logical at the same time and it doesnt weaken her skills it elevates them like slay

i did like how the kens took over barbieland due to the conversation it brought afterwards between barbie and ken i also liked the bit when they initially came into the real world and ken is like im being stared at but not like ogled a sense of admiration without any violent undertonesand then barbie says im definitely getting violent undertonesbecause to me it highlights the difference between how men and women have to navigate the world women have to be more careful have to let guys down easier because if theyre too harshor hurt the wrong guys ego they could be killed or harmed whereas men dont have to worry about that they wont be harmed simply walking down the street or after rejecting a girl at a bar",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtzkdU06vYHJKNreKLkGO6g,-0.698,negative,True

so many people correctly made the parallels between how the kens are treated in barbie world and how women are treated in the real world and then forgot by the end a lot of the barbies accomplishments are directly linked to being in power and in a position of privilege the kens only staged a revolt because they realized how underappreciated they were and how unequal their world is designed the barbies got a dose of their own medicine from that and didnt like the inequality so they reverted back to inequality this was so wild to me 
the solution has been entirely on a personal level and not a systemic one the barbies dont give up on their privileged position one bit the kens still dont even have a home they are being thrown back into the very system that oppresses them but with fun inspiring catch phrases and a suuuper sincere pinky promise that they can totally become a very very lowlevel anything someday maybe totally for sure
barbie apologized to ken and told him he is kenough and that he should define himself outside of barbie and ken and then she sends him back into homelessness uhm
i dont see this as feminist at all and i think sasha was very much correct in calling barbie a fascist
obviously they cant change the real world but they could have changed barbie world this is fiction mattelfinanced fiction but fiction nonetheless
if this was an attempt to portray current capitalist feminism and how insincere and useless it is it also doesnt do a great job because i felt like everyone was and specifically was supposed to root for the barbies and their regaining of power over the kens yes yes its licensed by mattel what do we expect but showing that the mojo dojo casa house sells like hot cakes and then not give the kens a teenytiny bit of shared power at the end the allmale board of directors of infilm mattel did not change either

something i want to add because i never see it being mentioned anywhere in any discourse about barbie whatsoever one of the many things that barbie taught me as a child was consent especially with regards to animals i only had a few barbie magazines but i collected the catalogues which were half magazine at least in germany and the stories that accompanied each barbie doll product with animals mostly horses which for me is another ironic nod in kens patriarchy always and ever included the animals consent step 1 was always care for the animal then step 2 was that the animal was happy now and wanted to be cuddled and only step 3 was actually cuddling this was something that i instinctively applied to my pets obviously but also to myself and other people you dont just go ahead and touch someone no you wait until the animal or the other person signals to you that they want this too

it definitely felt a shame despite being willing to turn to the audience and nakedly say things like corporations are bad and taking over patriarchy is still a towering monster representation matters at the climax the payoff seriously pulled back to wow it is frustrating to go through life as women and face double standards like back in the human world barbie experienced that one of the foundations of femininity was the total immersion in violence from men but all im really getting at is an echo of your entire thesis

when i saw him bust out that guitar i thought for sure ken was gonna sing wonderwall its the college guy with a guitar tries to woo the ladies song at first i was confused when i realized he was singing something different but then i recognized it and realized the brilliance  push by matchbox twenty literally showcases the way that the kens want patriarchy without fully understanding what it entails as well as the main kens desire for barbie to know how he felt about the way she treated him the songs chorus goes

i wanna push you around
well i will well i will
i wanna push you down
well i will well i will
i wanna take you for granted

the kens are literally trying to push the barbies lower on the social hierarchy but they clearly dont understand what that really means since they sing the song as a love song to them and ken has felt that barbie has been taking him for granted

basically this movie should not be interpreted as something to back men or women for both have their flaws but both need to take accountability for it there is a lot more progress on mens part in taking accountability and growth they have a long way to go still since theyre mostly what makes the world feel dangerous but women need to do their part as well and see the privileges they have too women have it much better than they did years ago and thats because women fought for it and also men give women a chance the same sentinment hasnt been reciprocated recently when to men its as though we are living in a matriarchy where like you said womenbarbies can dosay whatever they want no matter how awful while men cant and are ridiculed even for doing just a little men and women both cause those problems for each other but they also do it to themselves men not feeling able to express themselves fully is because of how women and other men react women feeling like they have so many expectations on them to be perfect is because of how men and other women act there needs to be a happy medium but both seem to blame the other i think both sides feel the same way about the other both want to just exist and be free hopefully wanting to become the best versions of themselves",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcvbCoy8Pzwi-avDo7N_TCQ,0.9817,positive,True

but it is so interesting how we have ppl criticizing how its not deep enough feminism wise and then on the other hand all these men and women on their bigoted antiwoke hate train wanting to declare national emergency bc of that you really see with female centered movies entertaining isnt enough most satires talk about stuff on a surface level or do a certain specific aspect and ppl are fine with it here again its not enough dont get me wrong a lot of ppl that talk about this critique still love the movie so its fine and then on the other side you have these ppl claiming they love satire and then have a problem that a certain group of men is being made fun of as if that isnt valid as if that is something so oversaturated as if it wasnt high time to do something like this 
i love the movie and apart from a few things i like the way it is bc plainly it is good that this movie as a feminist movie had this kind of well deserved success if they had done it more serious and deeper the movies success would be wayyyy less there we all know that only women or feminists watched other greta gerwig movies sooobtw love that she is finally getting more of the recognition she deserved years ago",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLxlMbrYX3B_voTt-o9P_Kg,0.9981,positive,True

also the evolution of the animated barbie films speaks to the development of their feminist messages and how it employs its characters and i was disappointed there wasnt much of any reference to them at all kens role in those films has been reduced considerably something that could have been used in his plotline as well as their famous breakup and the campaign surrounding it also none of her potential suitors from that cali girl era showed up in the film which would have made more sense than simu liu ken being primarily the other rival",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTe5zTtagElX7eieb38Ltlg,-0.7965,negative,True

more upsetting is how he got swept up into the patriarchy after years of being a primarily nontoxic male in support of barbie
ive seen many girls comment on how ken reminds them of their childhood male friends turning into sexist and gross jerks i think kens villainous does reflect how it isnt people who are inherently evil no one is born racist sexist etc it is taught by our parents society etc

ken had the best story in barbie
in barbie land ken is a pet that only desires to be loved all the kens desire to be loved by their own barbies and in a matriarchal society the barbies get to decide which can they want to be with
the kens are also the product of feminism hes a simp 
the kens are not men  they are what girls imagine males to be 
ken isnt evil or the vilian 
when ken gets back hes able to turn the entire population of barbie land by telling the kens about the outside world and that kens do have power  
as he said  some women asked him for the time   and all the kens gasped 
however the outside world isnt a patriarchal well ken tries to get a job because he thinks hes a man  and every time he gets rejected from every job  jobs that have women as doctors even  beach isnt a job he can do 
the experience of being of being respected as in in alive and rejected in the real world makes ken go back  and the act of going back  everyone in barbie land seems to happier i mean the kens are born of feminist teaching  their patriarchal system is for a barbie to get him a beer all the kens are now getting at the attention from their barbies and what happens when feminists come into barbie land 
they cant be happy for the kens or the barbies that like the new life style no it must be destroyed 
as the opening indicates baby dolls couldnt be put down or played with barbie  they must be killed 
and so the feminists kidnap every barbie  by manipulation and deception towards the kens and forcing some emotional dribble about the duality of life that everyone faces  
the movie is amazing  it shows the zealots  the surface level extreme views  and that life isnt a patriarchal its merit based  
and the kens go back to being pets and everyone is happy except the kens they dont count  

pregnant barbie isnt about under age teenagers having unwanted babies  barbies are not teenagers they are adults by rejecting pregnant barbie they are rejecting motherhood which is what moisten day feminism is about  

in the end barbie rejects her feminist utopian and decides to go find herself in the real world  where men are meant to dominating and is wanting to become pregnant barbie irl 
amazing movie really 

the double meaning in the movie is amazing   

heres an irl secret most men can relate to being ken 

on a side note the reason why the board of men are bathrooms inside their patriarchal society is because you cannot have confident men in such a feminist movie

its a masterpiece

after this she embraces it  a reflection of how body positivity changes barbieland furthermore showed by the acceptance of weird barbie as a valued member of society in the end she decides to live in the real world accepting the consequences shell inevitably have to deal with in the patriarchy that does not value her true self but ready to change the social climate

 greta wrote one of the best films depicting motherdaughter wounds and it doesnt show at all here and her partner noah is notoriously known for not understanding the women in his writing and often vilifying them in order to empathize with his male protagonists which is one of the reasons i believe ken is so fleshed out and the other characters have gaps also americas character wasnt given a full bag but her big speech was also delivered poorly and was a weak performance margot is an actress yes she is beautiful but she is a dynamo and the weakening of her performance with the cheap but shes pretty joke when we hadnt heard from the narrator in an hour was wasteful if you only look at the skeleton of the movie the plot is great if youre looking at what its wearing its visually stunning if youre looking for its flesh and bones then the meat leaves more to be desired and thats okay i expected more but i did have a good time for everything everyone else is harping on as reasons to ignore the notsogreat 710 this was only groundbreaking to a very specific audience how are you enjoying the eras tour",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzHSHQfl0w12NQKEvpkMiQg,0.9939,positive,True

since this often happens to me i can only assume that it happens to other people too i saw these moments as expressions of just that girls or people in general who dont think are smart but do occasionally have brighter moments and are like omgdid i just say that cool haha 

i value these moments because after years and yearsi came to the conclusion that its ok not to be smart and these little episodes of brightness are more than enough i dont have to be hard on myself for not being smarter than that my worth is the same 

i also dont agree with what you said about a matriarchy not being as problematic as a patriarchy every single human being has the potential to mistreat people in the movie this matriarchy is portrayed a certain way but i dont think it would look like that in the real world

there are women with authority who dont mistreat men they know what its like to be mistreated and belittled for their identity and they show empathybut other women can be just as nasty as the men who keep the patriarchy afloat 

i dont think we should have a patriarchy or a matriarchy we should all just be equal it sounds simplistic but i think its what most people fight for everyday equality of the sxes

65546,@ethansloan,4/8/2023,7:22:49,0,"this is basically exactly what i thought and felt as i left the theater its not a bad movie by any means but i went in expecting to absolutely love it so i was left a little disappointed i wont bring up everything i was thinking because you basically nailed it all but one aspect that i thought the film really overlooked was to completely skip any scenes showing how ken introduced patriarchy to barbieland 

the film portrays women actively supporting patriarchy literally like being under a magic spell and they have gloria handwave it away by saying that since theyve never dealt with sexism before they had no defenses for it thatspretty weak here in the real world a very important aspect of patriarchy and institutionalized sexism is the lies being told to people to get them onboard all those women on tik tok who keep promoting being trad wives are not brainwashed or under a spell theyve been fed a lifetime of false information and experienced how awful it can be to try and be anything else under a system that actively oppresses you and theyve come to the conclusion that the best way for a woman to live is like a submissive 50s housewife 

at one point one of the barbies says she loves patriarchy because its like her brain is on vacation everyday what if we had a scene where ken is trying to sell everyone on this new way of living and he asks her what her biggest problem is and she says something about how tiring it can be to have to think so deeply all the time maybe she even says math is hard and then ken can present patriarchy as freedom from all that tiring thinking later when theyre deprogramming the barbies dont have them just wake up like it was a spell make an impassioned argument for why agency is better than placidity i absolutely loved glorias monologue but it is a little incongruous with everything happening around it 

its also not great that instead of defeating patriarchy with better ideas the barbies win by making sure a historically oppressed minority in their world doesnt vote not the most clever of ideas afterwards i love how barbie and ken have an open and honest discussion about why everything went down and the guys all admit that oppressing women didnt actually make them happy and i kept thinking that maybe if youd had this conversation earlier you wouldnt have needed to stop them from voting of course being a movie that would have made for a very boring climax but you see what im getting at right 

honestly my biggest grip with the movie was everything related to mattel and ruth handler and portraying the actual realworld barbie product like a feminist weapon guys its just capitalism im fine with ignoring the exploitative capitalism that goes into barbie in order to tell a good story but dont have that story go out of its way to lie about that exploitation the mattel exec literally says hes not interested in money he only wants to empower girls seriously like its a little annoying how undercooked gloria and sasha are as characters and i wish the patriarchy aspects had dug a little deeper but portraying a billion dollar company that actively exploits women for profit as selfless agents of feminism was just offensive i didnt expect the movie to savagely take down mattel or anything they obviously made the movie i expected it to just ignore them it didnt have to say anything at all about the company i wonder if that was a note like if gerwig and baumbach were given a list of things they had to include in the movie and item one was make mattel look good 

ultimately it was a damn fun movie and i plan to see it again i really hope it leads to more femaledriven movies that actively and openly advocate a feminist agenda preferably a more deeply complex agenda if it gets at least a few boys to think patriarchy is stupid and only a tool for insecure losers it will be worth it

i love the movie it already handles a lot of issues very well and i think anything more would seem overwhelming and take away from the plot if you want a hyperrealistic accurate representation of all feminist issues including race class age mental health lgbt women mothers religion and anyall other things that arise when discussing something as broad as womanhood watch a documentary or several because even those cant cram all that information into 90 minutes sometimes all you can do is handle one issue at a time

edit also on the note of cellulite if she had gotten a wrinkle or grey hair that would have come across as ageist instead of fatphobic then people would have a problem with the film tells women that aging is a problem and women need to look as young as possible and thats actually pretty true like even though there are fat barbies there arent really any old ones so i think giving her cellulite which isnt fat btw just a skin thing but ive already seen tons of comments about that while having plus sized barbies makes more sense than giving her a grey hair when 1 she obviously looks super young otherwise and 2 there isnt any representation for older barbies",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmdTqs8Jve4g5QxjgPmcyng,0.9801,positive,True

65594,@sashhhaa4874,2/8/2023,17:15:50,3,"i think after listening to a few reviews ive also come to the conclusion that i would rate the movie keyword i  a 657 out of 10 my reasons for it not being a 1010 are and i know a lot of ppl in this comment section are saying that this movie shouldnt be taken too seriously bc its aim wasnt to be some big feminist think piece that it addressed the social issue of the patriarchy and misogyny and how they cause female suffering but it didnt bring anything new to the table 

like it just reiterated the same points weve already heard on this conversation and you may be thinking what more is there to say like the creator of the video mentioned misogyny affects different women and girls in different ways which couldve been portrayed and highlighted and also how patriarchy is negative for men too and have ken realise how hard it is to always live up to the demands of being a manin the patriarchy then come to the conclusion on his own that turning barbielandinto the kendomor whatever its called i cant remember  wasnt the best bet after all as no one wins 

i kinda thought at the end they were gonna let the kens also have some power too like when they asked if they could be a part of the supreme court to show that a perfect world would be both sexes living in harmony and having equal power not one more powerful than the other and im not saying that the writers and directors not choosing to let the kens have that bit of power is sexist or misandrist as i dont know what the creator of barbies aim was it couldve been to show little girls an alternate universe where they have as much power as men do in the real world and it is possible for them to everything men can or not 

i also thought it wouldve been very exciting to explore barbies existentialism a bit more as before i had watched the movie and only seen the trailer i thought that was gonna be the main plot point but after finding out that the existential thoughts barbie experienced werent actually her own and just glorias projected onto her i was a little crushed i didnt get to see barbie navigate through an existential crisis throughout majority of the movie that existentialism was swept under the rug until at the end when the barbies took back barbieland sasha asks what happens to barbies story and how does it end and i know it would be kinda weird to expect barbie to come to a conclusion about the purpose of her own existence considering shes literally just a doll who isnt actually alive but she eventually does choose to live as a human so i will always wonder how barbie would have navigated thoughts of her own existence and its importance as a human

overall loved the movie had great visuals and costumes i lovedddddd all the barbiesoutfits smmm when i was kid i wouldve had a field day playing with barbies like that also the lighthearted humour too kept it entertaining  the songs were great and the scene at the end when barbie closes her eyes and has like a montage of lots of different women and girlslives almost had me in tears i hadnt felt so warm in such a long time  it lowkey made my inner child wanna go and buy a bunch of dolls and start playing with them again bc dolls were a huge part of my childhood ",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEn9uX1kPJizXJ-VUGJTwQ,0.9914,positive,True

movie 1 barbie should be barbie realising that her legacy was not as positive as she thought in the real world and being upset that the mattel company is run by men she can still find sasha and her mother and take them back to barbie land to teach the other barbies about the real world a good ending could just be that the mother gets a higher level job in the mattel company and gets to hire other women and the daughter learns to be nicer to people at school and the barbies learning to treat the weird barbie and other marginalised barbies better the focus should be on female friendships and the motherdaughter relationship that is it should actually focus on women

movie 2 ken should be ken going to the real world and discovering the concept of the patriarchy then coming back to barbie land to explain to the kens that everything is upside down in barbie land and that they would be better off in the real world ken can point out that the barbies are being hypocrites they might have learnt about female friendships in the first movie but they werent treating the kens any better as they still feel like accessories all of the kens leave barbie world to go to the real world and then the barbies realise that they had underappreciated the kens and the kens quickly realise that they actually dont like the real world either  that its been destructive to their friendships with each other the kens need to learn about healthy masculinity  overcoming their competitiveness with other kens and the barbies need to learn that gender equality is not just about female empowerment as is often misconstrued but that its actually about treating everyone with respect and kindness and that it is never ok to treat people like objects

while i agree that gloria and sasha should have been more fleshed out and that barbies time in the real world should have been longer the idea with the sleepover is pretty good i dont think that the ken stuff should be cut down not because that this ken is literally iconic but because his story serves as a very valuable lesson to men that they just like women shouldnt base their entire identity on one thing and more importantly that they shouldnt cling to outdated ideologies like the patriarchy to feel and be accepted and respected in society to find solidarity in eachother and solice in the fact that by just being themselves they are enough

i do think that giving gloria and sasha some story and character tweeks would be much better than what we got and also help to make them feel more real and important to the story

edit and while yes the barbies did not treat them nearly as bad as the kens did to the barbies they still undermineded them and treated them unequally i mean hell the barbies didnt even know where the kens lived not even if they had anywhere to because it didnt matter to them they were there to hype them up 
im not condoning their actions it was wayyyyy fucked up what they did but the movie also acknowledge that neither the patriarcy nor the matriachy are good ideologies for a society to be build upon since both opress large groups of people and are both unjust thats also why the barbies insists at the end of the movie that barbieland doesnt go back to what it once was since they now see that they were doing somewhat the same shit to the kens as the kens where doing to them

however i disagree with your evaluation of the matriarchy you show in your argument that its an easy way of saying the gender reversal doesnt make a difference the barbies arent being as bad as men but its a digestible way of presenting to men that the patriarchy is dumb the kens are literally objects but the barbies arent inherently bad the system is bad the kens revolt in a way that they feel will give them autonomy but theyre doing it off of what ken saw not what they want 

i think the toxicity of the kens was done really well it had weight when ken told barbie it doesnt feel good does it because the conplexity of how the patriarchy impacts men is being shown men blame women for the negative aspects of the patriarchy without realizing that its the patriarchy thats telling them to be a certain way and do certain things

also i personally wish the movies ending regarding barbie land was more egalitarian in nature rather than be an inverse of the real world where the kens have to work and prove their worth to have a seat at the table in their government while i understand that this was done to reflect the unfair treatment of women in our reality such mismatch in power dynamics being carried out in barbie land  which was framed to be a utopian world  felt out of place it almost felt like barbie land ended up operating like the real world in terms of power dynamics just with the sexes reversed which was a real shame i had hoped that barbie lands government would model what the world should ideally be the sort of world we should be working towards  a place of gender equality that doesnt follow in the footsteps of our reality

granted i understand why it ended the way it did especially if barbie land is meant to represent the space of girlhood and how the introduction of toxic masculinity can corrupt and tarnish the lived experience of women im all for the reclamation of girlhood but i can also see how the have a taste of your own medicine message runs the risk of being taken at face value and incite some to coopt liberal arguments of the kens being oppressedsilenced claim hypocrisy and further cement their opposition against feminism but perhaps thats a conversation for a different movie as well as point back to how barbie touches on so many themes and topics only to speak on a few",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CkjGe-H_aOtrT1d2bZYdg,0.8157,positive,True

i really loved the ken focus we are shown how hes an ass but then we see again and again that he is lost and genuinely doesnt know any better he wasnt just a silly male character he was symbolic of how the patriarchy actively harms men too little boys arent taught whats right and wrong they dont have rolemodels they dont understand how and why their behaviour is damaging and that is a huge part of the problem a lot of our current toxic male attitudes come from genuine ignorance cause theu listen to ignorant men and adhere to tradition out of fear and lack of sense of self 

ken truly believes that having barbie or a barbie will make him whole thats all he knows all hes ever been told he cant see himself as a whole person and i think a lot of real world men act this way too they think owning a woman will equal happiness when it doesnt no one is responsible for your own happiness they are disillusioned and angry lonely they blame us because they dont know who else to blame 

thats why i personally see the men who actively dislike this film as lost sad men cause kens character was brilliant the line about the kens will eventually reach the same level in barbieland as women are in the real world if men believe women are equal in the real world then how are they offended that kens will reach the same level logic yknow if theyre offended by that theyre acknowledging that women are not equal in the real world 

the mother and daughter are us the audience they arent focused on more because they needed to keep them vague enough that we all could relate the mothers character delivers the message so she speaks for us in the real world she has to be representative of all of us

also glad you brought up the weird framing of barbielands matriarchal society and how the movie tries to depict it as comparable to the patriarchy when it clearly isnt like the kens and the weird barbies definitely face a degree of marginalization that is never adequately addressed or resolved the kens dont have houses the weird barbies are treated like outcasts but to liken their experience to literal real world misogyny complete with objectification harassment and the literal constant threat of violence is ridiculous like what was with that line saying that maybe someday the kens would have the same degree of power as women in the human world what does that even mean

and then the problem is that if barbieland is indeed a dystopia after all why would you place women who are trans fat differently abled and nonwhite in positive leadership and career positions that is to say why give all this positive representation and then imply that barbieland is capable of just as much discrimination as the human world so its basically just as bad actually its definitely really weird and uncomfortable to the point that im not convinced greta gerwig herself even knew what she wanted her message to be",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEerWC4dBya4WZL_MkN4Svw,-0.9046,negative,True

barbie thinks she lives in a perfect world where women rule everything but ken feels like an object or accessory to barbie like in the real world but switch the sex of the characters
the human who plays with her is living in the real world where its the opposite and barbie starts to get affected by the feelings of the woman who feels like she is an object or accessory since she never had too experienced these emotions that are being projected onto her she thinks something is wrong so her and ken go to the real world to find the woman whos projecting onto her while there she realizes that mattel never helped to make the world better for women like she thought they did and ken is enlightenedby the patriarchy that he enjoys because he gets to be in power ken doesnt recognize how this would make others feel and assumes that the patriarchy is a perfect system 
barbie explores the beauty of life and the emotions that comes with it and is soon told that her life and existence has harmed women instead of helping them she has an existential crisis and is brought back to mattel ken tells everyone what he learned about the patriarchy and how perfect he thinks it is which brainwashes the smart and intelligent women into being eye candy and accessories for the men which switches the roles in barbieland and the kens see nothing wrong with it because theyre told that its perfect barbie escapes mattel and returns to barbieland and she helps too i do the brainwashing done to the women by reminding them of how strong and smart they are and she manages to get the men to be friends and realize the error of their ways barbie realizes that she was unfair to ken and how he and the other kens were used as objects a reference to the real world with reversed roles
and they decided to make barbieland equal and to recognize everyone as people barbie decides to live in the real world were she can try too actually make things better for women and where she can express herself and grow as a person",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9GhL7-Sw8bWG3IIgIqGM9A,0.9952,positive,True

points where i disagree
1 ken wasnt presented as just a friend he was literally called barbies boyfriend so it makes more sense that his expectations were that of a boyfriend not just a typical guy friend who wants to be more
2 barbie did experience goodness that came out of the real world meeting an old woman ruth as a creator sasha and her daughters relationship and how they tackle it  the latter two culminating in her words i want to be ideator not just an idea
3 i think the comedic timing was good in that the serious moments of which there were many gave a good amount of time to process esp through repetition
4 if the movie when with this reviewers rewrite of sasha bringing barbie back to her house to hideit just wouldve been so typical i was gladly surprised by sasha going to barbieland with barbie
5 reviewer backs up into her own logic when she says the film shows that the matriarchy is just as problematic as the patriarchy when she goes onto give examples of how kendom was worse than barbieland
6 people like the person who the reviewer puts a clown face over think that the barbie movie hates men bc the film is angry at men not bc ken was depicted as a bimbo
7 i think using cellulite vs signs of aging as a last straw moment does hit harder bc the former is more commonly addressed as a beauty flaw but the reviewer does admit that this is a minor thing

i really liked your point about how barbie matriarchy is about doing whatever they want vs ken patriarchy being about making others do what they want i think it encapsulates why barbieland feels more benign while kendom feels hostile barbieland is based on idyllic feminism while kendom is based on very painfully realistic misogyny but at the same time i feel like the light hearted treatment of kens issues kind of failed his character especially when he is an excellent parallel and narrative foil for barbie beach is as symbolically useless as stereotypical in terms of purpose

and a lot of the jokes actually left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth which is why i cant fully agree with your point about the matriarchy as benign particularly ken only has a good day when barbie smiles at him i laughed initially and about 20 seconds later felt really gross about it because it is such a good establishment of there is no point of ken existing without barbie  and later when he steals her dreamhouse and barbie realizes that kens dont have houses they functionally are all implied to be homeless which put an entirely different context on the every night is girls night conversation the joke of eventually kens will have as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world is an iconic hilarious joke but also makes you realize that they dont even have those rights yet they were truly second class citizens and theres something to be said about how that structure left every ken extremely vulnerable to the cultish mindset of real world patriarchy

it felt like they had a lot to say but didnt discipline their focus and so what did come out felt shallow and lacking 

i wish they wouldve just kept ken as a supportive himbo and not gone any deeper with that because honestly not only does his journey take up more screentime it also feels more fleshed out and interesting than what barbie goes through in my opinion barbie first has an existential crisis then is forced to leave her world for the real world then has an identity crisis then feels dejected about the kendom then saves barbieland only after being encouraged by gloria to do so and then decides she wants to be human despite being treated like crap in the human world her story feels convulted and lacking agency except for her final decision which just kind of felt like a random one to me

if they had focused on her interaction with gloria and sasha and made that the focal point i think the movie wouldve been better off also if they gave gloria a mom we couldve seen how three generations of women come together despite their differences perhaps gloria is a divorced single mom yearning for the simplicity of childhood when she could dream big and wasnt weighed down with lifes hardships and glorias mom gives her daughter a hard time for getting divorced and trying to take care of sasha on her own this could be a representation of the loving but traditionalistic hispanic mother and sasha is trying to grow up too fast and prove to the world that she is not just a silly girl like barbie represents over the course of the movie after barbie interacts with them gloria reconciles with her childhood self and rekindles her dream of going into toy design glorias mother begins to accept her daughters independent nature and respects her parenting sasha sees that its okay to slow down and not grow up so fast and realizes that barbie isnt necessarily the embodiment of unrealistic expectations for women but a vessel through which young girls can dream and imagine as seen by her mother and barbie realizes that life isnt as simple as it is in barbieland but that doesnt mean it cant be just as beautiful perhaps she even longs for a mother figure herself as she watches the three women interact and thats where her meeting with rhea pearlman comes into play at this point rheas line of mothers standing still for their daughters wouldve felt a lot more poignant and suitable i think if the film took this direction it wouldve been a sweet film for mothers to take their daughters to

overall i thought it was fun to a certain degree but id be lying if i said it didnt kind of feel like a drag at times there were moments where i kind of felt shamed for loving barbie so much as a kid as if im part of the problem and i dont think that was necessarily a message they meant to leave women and girls with",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8UY0EzcYKXbF8_VZ_FAZ9g,0.9948,positive,True

and the greatest point of the movie is how it exposed society we are still do biased to men that a comedy movie  made by women for women is getting so much hate for picturing men as cartoonish society is too blinded by hatured to feminism that they couldnt see the movie for what really is the movies proved that society is clueless about female oppression to thepoint were they didnt see it

yes some of the feminist issues were surface level yet even that sent so many people into frenzies and targeted the movie as being antimen sometimes you have to start somewhere and maybe its better to have a simple message reach a lot of people than a huge message reach a selected few for some it may be tired oversimplified feminism for others its a message they dearly need to hear broadening and simplifying helps with inclusivity too
also i disagree with the criticism about the lack of a motherhood arc im thankful that the movie didnt tap into that motherhood is still such a charged topic and so expected of women that i liked that motherhood was one facet of the identities presented feminism can be discussed without necesarily including motherhood not that motherhood is something undesirable at all but i think its time we start to understand that its ok to discuss the 2 womanhood and motherhood separately sometimes
barbie has been a mother plenty of girls myself included have played make believe with barbiemother and barbiedaughter and theres literally a pregnant barbie in the movie  i think that if they had made barbie pregnant or with child or wanting a child it would have played into the tired trope of womanasamom that feminism has talked about for a long time now considering that over half of millennial women have chosen not to have children yet still struggle to have that representation and validity and still have to justify their lack of children to me it would have been a huge disappointment if my childhood favorite dolls epitome of womanhood had been childcentric 
i didnt find fault with the time dedicated to ken either as the parallel they were trying to make was how women are treated they had to actually show and explore that parallel the difference in  portraying barbies do whatever they want kens force others to do what they wanti think also worked yes theres a difference but if the kens had just done what barbies were doing it wouldnt have been as impactful and would have gone straight over most mens heads and if the barbies had done what kens and men in the real world then it really would have alienated male audiences its unfair but its true subtle as it was it already bothered so many

i also was disappointed that they didnt do more with sasha she kind of silently in the background comes around to liking barbie but we never see that growth of being a tween and thinking girly things arent coolare bad and then her accepting that being feminine isnt a bad thing it all happens silently lol like shes just a prop thats a big journey a lot of girls and women go through loving girly things when youre little rejecting those things when youre older because you think pink and femininity are weak things to growing past that stage and accepting that you can still like pink and cute clothes and dolls and still be a fully rounded empowered woman

the movie kind of just ended up being feminism 101 for people who i guess are new to the subject which is supposedly a huge percentage of the population because theeeeeee amount of outrage i have seen about the movie being so extreme in its message girl literally the most extreme message the movie has is women are peoplehttpwwwyoutubecomchanneluc5hl3h91a3tcteyq7sialq

kill babies

pregnant women are weird

men are obviously evil

women deserve all the power just because

the only thing men deserve is to be at the bottom and powerless because misandry feels really good especially if you label it feminism instead

any woman that wants to be with a man is brainwashed and really just doesnt know who she is

any man that wants to be with a woman is weak and really doesnt know who he is

unless of course that man wants to be with a trans who cant reproduce then its perfectly acceptable

the only way to truly be human and live a meaningful life is to hope to die as soon as possible

i believe greta took the idea of feminism into a power by showing that not only  that women can take their power back and have freedom but also by using that power or influence to understand what men are going through equalize
both male and female got underminded by one another saw how they didnt like it and at the end buildredefined a new purpose for everyone
i felt like it was about power and being human and how they both havent been working together they is an imbalance about it and that everything is never perfect but taking the time to understand helps even if you dont know where to start
i think this movie is more of a bigger picture idea kinda like the animated movies but it deals with the real world problem of equality and humanization

not everything women do has to serve every cause on the planet sometimes we can just talk about girlhood without having to feel like we need to make sure every single person around us is catered for margot robbie isnt playing gloria steinem issa rae isnt playing bell hooks theyre playing barbies the film is about a doll learning what being a woman is whilst also giving us humour amazing visuals and the song of the summer im just ken should be no1 on the charts imo its also a movie marketed at both children and young women so i never expected anything too radical

i agree with your point about the mattel execs plotline i think it could have been handled better i also agree about the handling of sashas character

however i disagree with the way youve analysed the feminist aspects of the film noone expects a male director to serve us a revolutionary philosophical political masterpiece when theyre putting out a blockbuster summer movie so why do we expect that from a female director why does this movie need to be groundbreaking why does gerwig owe us that why do we expect women to cater to everyone all the time it literally links exactly to what gloria said about women needing to please everyone constantly yet still always being told that theyve failed

your point about cellulite is also quite redundant because many slim women have cellulite i remember getting cellulite on my thighs when i was around 16 despite being slim all my life the point barbie makes isnt oh no im so fat its oh no im not perfect which is exactly how i felt at 16 and so many other women  both slimmer and larger  have felt at some point 

this movie is brilliant it is fun silly and unapologetically girly and it features beautiful visual representation of trans women woc plus sized women and women with disabilities playing barbies is it perfect no but i dont know a movie that is of course we can criticise elements of the plots or acting or directorial choices but i just feel that it is rather ironic to pick apart the lack of feminism in this particular film

i am so sick of women being expected to be mouthpieces for every woman on the planet it is not only a strange expectation that is never put on men but it is literally impossible it is not gerwigs duty to write a movie highlighting the deep intricacies of intersectional feminism just because she is a woman and if she had explicitly written about the experiences of women of colour or trans women or plus sized women or women with disabilities you just know for a fact that she would have still been criticised for the way she handled it we cant win

i also wish they axed the mattel ceo scenes i mean what commentary were they really going to make when mattel is footing the bill and giving you permission to use their property i agree we needed more time with human women if were following the allegory of growing up then we need the human women to be moms sisters and friends uplifting the barbies so often we see women tearing each other apart on screen when what is needed is to be uplifted 
in the end i do get what they were trying to do with every choice but it felt a little too many cooks in the kitchen i still absolutely loved it and knew it wasnt going to be a seminal feminist text but i think its a good place for preteens to start it is light digestible quotable and it opens the door for questions",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8OUziZKU7zOOyqxIE4NtFg,0.9689,positive,True

dang i usually agree with you but this synopsis completely missed the mark for me its a movie about a barbie doll and greta managed to make it really poignant and introspective without being too topical and predictable its about deconstructing your personal meaning within the structures of patriarchy feminism and society theres the part in the movie where americas character says she just wants a regular barbie who is a normal girl and isnt 110 over the top spectacular and high achieving that combined with the end scene where she is told to feel with the person who created her lends me to think barbie doesnt necessarily have or want to be this shining beacon of feminism perfection and positivity rather she wants to feel the spectrum of a normal human experience 
 
the humor was incredibly refreshing and didnt at all take away from the serious topics of the movie the jokes all landed in the audience and we were all laughing out loud and i even had several belly laughs movies about these really deep topics dont have to be these despondent forlorn thinkpieces that would go over the heads of the everyday person going to see this movie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GrYmMAJEncI2MR9lKsYXw,0.9695,positive,True
66214,@Bri.510,26/7/2023,12:52:43,0,"i really like the points and suggestions you offered about the potential of this film

adding on i think it would have been interesting and important for ken to go through what barbie goes through in the real world about what kens existence means and does for boys not able to play for fear of being shamed also feeling bad for not having a ken gi joe or superhero physique and it wouldve been nice to see ken being appalled by how barbie is treated in the real world and understanding that the matriarchy at least treated everyone well this wouldve also been neat for character development in all the kens 

similar to what you said i wish there wasnt a back and forth between smart and dumb remarks from the characters i also wish that ken wasnt portrayed as an airhead 

i also like the concept of weird barbie and having her be the wise character on the hill but because shes a barbie and barbie land is trying to demonstrate equality with size coloretc in this film i would have liked to have seen weird barbie and other unconventional barbies like midge in the scenes with the other barbies at the dance party on the beach midge was at the dance party but weird barbie stays outcasted on the hill either that or chooses not to be with the others it just doesnt feel like barbie land was thought about in being a very equal place

especially when the event that pushes barbie to go to the real world is that she gets cellulite it makes sense that cellulite represents a human transition instead of having perfect plastic legs but i feel like its hard not to get the message that cellulite is bad at the start of the film they show barbies of different sizes treated equally and achieving great things like winning a nobel prize i just feel that this is undermined when stereotypical barbie gains some weight i like that the review offers that it wouldve been better for stereotypical barbie to experience aging instead like getting a wrinkle or noticing a gray hair something that could help address societys fear and shame of aging and that wouldve made barbies compliment to an older woman and deciding to live in the real world so much more profound 

i also like that this review addressed that the movie didnt recognize that being a mother is also a fine route for people having a scene where barbie and midge talk about this or even as the review discusses having more of a backstory to gloria and having more interactions with gloria and her daughter throughout the film to show the progression good things and hard things about being a parent wouldve been a nice representation for this

circling back to my first point about having ken go through a similar experience of barbie but through the eyes of boys i think it wouldve been interesting for gloria to have a daughter and son to show their different experiences and having a progression with the message that its okay to be who you are look how you are play with what you want to play with imagine and ken and barbie return to barbie land sharing what theyve learned and making barbie land a better fairer place or that they both decide to be human and are seen applying what theyve learned to better the real world 

i get that this film could be seen in just lighthearted fun and did give some good messages i just agree that there was so much more potential here 

films have a great power to make us feel pay attention and call us to action i also had the feeling that this film was afraid to make us feel too much and thats okay humor is important but because it is barbie i wish there was more substance in it to help us further question develop empathy and call us to action in society",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuX3zr_Gr6IfWYTQh2MEYew,0.9989,positive,True

the definition of matriarchy got twisted by patriarchy itself and colonialism if you are more interested in the topic id recommend to look up the research of heide gttnerabendoth and also look into terms like matrifocal matrilocal and matrilineal 

barbieland can not be a matriarchy because there are literarily no barbies that are mothers who could pass on anything to their offspring who want to birth children id rather say barbieland is a femalebuild and femalegoverned society",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5V7jevlE_G2PZDLjov83Qg,0.9238,positive,True

sorry i know this is long but if you please give it a chance a few critiquesquestions i had after sitting with the film i still love it but there was definitely plotholes i noticed and id love to hear your thoughts on the points i bring up love your channel xx

in my opinion i wish they made the barbie movie rated m and committed to it looking back on it there were a few ideas  ig the depression coming through the barbie  that were sorta dropped and forgotten aboutlike i know gloria has the speech which i love but like that doesnt cure depression i would have liked to see that thought resolved more ig therapy or somethingespecially considering its the catalyst for generic barbie to go to the real world also her daughter sasha didnt even react to finding out her mums depressed lol also i wish they developed more of a relationship with the daughter and generic barbiemaybe addressing how critical sasha was of barbie which as they said is merely a representation of 1 way a woman can present the point came from gloria but it felt like it was something sasha had to realise or at least update her initial opinion on because that wasnt really finished
i cant help but wish it was m so the dark comedy and social commentary leaned more mean girls fleabag etc and these ideas could be fleshed out and concluded more neatlyi know greta could have written it but something tells me raising it from pg to m limits their audiences and their producers didnt want that pft

like maybe if the kenpatriarchy arch was cut down even though it was really good cant help but think if we cut the song and halved the battle wed have room for the previous thoughts mentioned to be honest i think there were so many ideas from this concept and just not enough movielike it needed to be 4 hrs pft or maybe a sequel ",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8BgauDAYKWv9H2uCRM9lw,0.9939,positive,True

66305,@belle4953,26/7/2023,7:50:30,1,"thank you for voicing my thoughts i too walked away feeling very disappointed i felt the trailer was very misleading it suggested a more light hearted fun vibe instead of the rather abrasive and intense 2nd and 3rd acts which i guess mightve been for stylistic reasons but it was a bit of a jarring watching experience 

some of the most egregious offences in my opinion were 
1 i agreed that the movie tried to combat too many facets of feminism at once just do one or two well instead of ten halfdone where the transition between themes gives you whiplash
2 okay after your analysis i can kind of forgive why ken is portrayed as a bit like of a moron but all the men in the film were idiots the kens the mattel executives and glorias husband i dont know why that decision was made and it relegated men to some of the same denigration that women have faced in the past 
3 was it just me or did you think the movie was going to end on almost five seperate occasions it didnt help that i needed to pee by the time we got to the ending but i was just thinking when is this going to end already
4 why dont some of the kens get to keep some of their positions after the barbies take back barbie land was it meant to be an observation of our real world structures that continue to advance men while women try to catch up but i missed the point i think this contributed to the antimencriticisms
5 unlike greta gerwigs previous works there was no subtlety to her dialogue on feminism if you played a drinking game to the words patriarchy you would get alcohol poisoning i think this has led to the alienation of the male demographic and i just dont think the movie added anything new to the conversation that hasnt been said before and better in other films  they probably couldve done more if they didnt have the problem of trying to tackle too many things at once
6 why were the barbies so easily brainwashed by the kens it seems like theyre saying barbie  ie women  are easily manipulated

66311,@michelottens6083,26/7/2023,7:43:11,1,"its fascinating to me how every analysis or review of this movie seems to ignore the admittedly weirdly artfilmlike intro scene and the long buildup to the outro gag people seem to pick up their analysis at the music intro and close on the end of kens and the ceos story to then get mad about the shallow feminism and barbies curtailed arc
the admittedly obtuse and trippy frame of this whole film is precisely where they make the point that this movie could never have it all for every audience member but that doll play and fantasy films are about these brief power fantasies that can feed a kind of purposefully naive idealism and sense of agency as we take the experience back to our harsh outside real lives

i get that the movie was way too stacked with layered stories themes and styles of delivery but everyone just piling on critiquing the shallow instagram popfeminism instead of taking the film as a whole feels more shortsightedly instagrammy than the movie itself to me i mean the big message moments were to me purposefully just these slacktivismbaiting resolutions of some minor themes and action scenes with a bigger strangely obtuse arthouse story going on around them im fairly certain im not overanalyzing or doing a cognitive dissonance here given the actual runtime devoted to stuff in the movie people flatout arent mentioning in the discourse

the reception of this movie is odd to me is all

personally i also dont think we really needed to see more of gloria and sashas relationship i think their purpose is to show the differences of generational attitudes towards feminism than a motherdaughter dynamic the movies not so much about their individual relationship as much as it is about how our perspective on womanhood has changed through the years and reflected on the unchanging barbie

i think the people who watch this film criticizing the cellulite part completely forgot what the cellulite part even came from none of them probably even knew what cellulite was until barbie started having insecurities about getting cellulite literally because of a real human being putting that emotion onto her of course barbie is going to be insecure about it and think its an imperfection literally because the real world forces women to believe that its an imperfection so women can hate themselves and try to change themselves to please men and society to then bully them about trying to please men and society so they hate themselves more its literally meant to be a joke honestly if anything the other barbies probably think cellulite is a form of imperfection like how pieces of a barbies leg would be slightly chipped here and there if a dog bit her type vibes



barbies in barbieland giving kens little rights is the point thats the joke its apart of the joke its a joke about the real world the barbie world is now perfectly matched with the real world except men treating women like objects sex objects and overall like some form of slave ig



literally what are you guys talking about when it comes to barbie being a mother or something in this movie what about any scenes in this movie gave you guys the idea that she wanted to be a mother or wanted to go to the real world to experience motherhood what are you guys talking about what scene made you guys think this what part of the movies themes even gave you guys the impression that this was about motherhood this is about individuality this movie is literally about individuality and separating yourself from the sexism and feminism its literally about fixing society for individuals being an individual doing the imagination because you are an individual and being human which is apart of being an individual the scene at the end is literally a joke about her being humanplastic she never had genitals a joke told a few times throughout the movie of course they would make another lighthearted joke about barbies genitals and her finally being able to get somesee some after the serious tone in the other scenes if you guys should have gotten any misunderstanding with that scene i would have personally misunderstood that it was talking about trans women or something but motherhood what are you talking about



barbie leaving to live in the real world is to represent little girls growing out of dolls and growing up it represents a little girl forced to play with stereotypical girly things because of how society portrays them and wants them to be in a box to please society it represents a little girl imagining herself being big things like a doctor or astronaut while still trying to please and conform to society it represents a little girl imagining herself what people want her to be then growing up and finally wanting to do the imagining herself what she wants to think and imagine like what babrie wanted for herself",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM8MLERg9ckRVayQmkuWkmg,0.9819,positive,True

it took me a little while to warm up to the movie because i think i had a million different expectations for it but if you view it as both a satire of and a love letter to a toy that many of us grew up loving and still do love it becomes a lot more appealing i think barbies story arc of going to the real world and becoming real herself in the end is meant to show that we can all be barbie and that barbie is all of us 

i liked how the movie explored the implications of ken being an accessory to barbie ryan gosling has famously said that his own daughters silly mistreatment of ken inspired him to join the cast of the movie and the extremes of both barbieland ruled by barbies and by kens setting aside both at the end in favor of some balance albeit still leaning towards the barbies because theyre marketed primarily to girls which makes sense i honestly found kens story arc more inspirational and interesting then barbies at times i think any of the men complaining about this movie need to see it at home away from the extreme female energy in the theatre that im assuming made them feel uncomfortable  and really pay attention to kens story arc because a movie about a girls toy line gave more attention to the male character in that toy line then a movie about a boys toy line would give to whatever female characters are in the movie

i just felt like this movie was at once misogynist and misandrist which is to say unrepresentative of feminisms real approach to men and patriarchy the no kens cant be in the supreme court haha maybe in the future theyll get as much rep as women irl moment was extremely odd as a concluding note for the film this is the new equal world thats better than the real world the barbies quick acceptance of patriarchy as a good thing was also extremely odd so youre basically saying that innately these driven and intelligent and independent women instinctively feel that extremist patriarchy is the best that they must be persuaded back to their old lives but that patriarchy simply clicks in their brain without any need for convincing also odd was the implication that any woman who subscribes to traditional gender roles must be brainwashed although thats a minor gripe considering barbie has never quite been a trad woman 

and to be quite honest an eye candy side character himbo ken would have been fine had they not gone out of their way to establish the kens as genuinely capable of desiring a role beyond that if you construct a world in which kens are satisfied with being beach thats cool its just a fun little movie if you construct a world in which they are not content with their gender and societal role but then create a satisfying conclusion to this thats also great but if you establish them as wanting more but then conclude this arc with them saying im ken you spit in the face of any commentary you so clearly wanted to present and end up in my opinion pushing a genuinely harmful narrative when barbie world is an allegory for the real world you are basically saying that women just need to be themselves  so they can solve patriarchy  or whatever 

and because this movie insists on explicitly making feminism patriarchy equality gender etc to be focal points of the plot you really cant turn off your brain  just have fun sure this isnt a piece of insane professional critical commentary on society but clearly it is attempting some sort of allegory  explicitly using politicalideological terms",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN2MQ8NjsjmYKbUAsckS46Q,0.9953,positive,True

i like barbie this isnt barbie woke boo comment

first and unpopular opinion by making ken a villain we already have a nice guy male doll who want to control barbie  ryan why take the doll who has always been by her side who was never disatisfied to be her accessory and make him the opposite 
it sends the message that to  be the main character barbie needs to lower ken bad message

this one decision leave a bad taste in the ending by making ken a victim of a world where all positions of powers are in the ends of barbies then reversing it with the arrivsl of patriarchy thanks to ken and then the conclusion that the first system if better the only difference between the old system and the new one is the sex in charge 
should developpe what i mean but english isnt my native langage and i have so many thoughts i cant really explain my point they are more difference like the objectifications im mostly taalking about the absolute power held by barbies then kens then barbies again

in life in the dreamhouse we had ryan and self absorbed failed musician in love with barbie because she is the perfect doll and would be the peerfect accessory for him
had he played the role of ken in this movie everything would have made sense imo

66607,@JossSCarlisle,25/7/2023,23:54:53,74,"1 this is a personal anecdote that really isnt objective on the overall quality or commentary that the film provides but this movie really helped me to better connected with my identity as a trans person very specifically the line that gloria says im just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us there have been so many times that ive decided to put on pants which arent inherently masculine but make an amab person like me present more masculine instead of dressing more femininely because i wanted people to like me or take me more seriously it helped me acknowledge the screwed up privilege in that but also how much im willing to let other peoples perception of me affect how i express my gender identity which brings me to my next point

2 this movie did the right thing by not trying to be an academic breakdown of feminism through the lens of barbie theres a reason why it was the highest grossing film over the weekend and thats because it was able to capture an audience that previously had not really been a part of online discourse i never thought of this movie as a movie attempting to give a younger generation an in on feminism theyre already on the internet and theyre already a part of the discourse ive always thought this movie was meant for the working mom who comes home from work makes dinner and then goes to bed because she has work in the morning and she has to take her kids to school those kinds of parents dont have time to be apart of the online discourse or the discussions weve been having about feminism and as a result theyve not been given the space to express how theyve been affected by a patriarchal society its why i think despite being a feeling expressed online for a while know glorias monologue works well it has been heard but not by this audience 

3 i also think that this movie has a better grasp on the goals of feminism than other mainstream movies that claim to be feminist the beginning of the movie looks like something straight off the end of camilla cabellos cinderella theyre all girl bosses because thats what a feminist is right the movie shows us that feminism and feminist movements have always been about the freedom of choice and the freedom to choose your own path you should be just a mother if thats what you want you should be able to be anything you want and thats true feminism at least from where im standing it shows how patriarchal thinking is toxic to everyone including men who dont know how to define themselves outside of what society thinks they should be 

overall i do think the movie is doing a lot and to some extent i agree that gloria should have been a bigger part of the movie  as someone who identifies as transfemmenonbinary i also think that this movie is very binary and it doesnt hold a lot of space for people like me who dont fit perfectly in the binary any criticism of this film except for the criticism that its a manhating piece of trash ive seen so far is valid and i understand the reasoning behind it its not a perfect film for me but at the end of the day i think this movie is doing a lot more good than it is bad theres so much joy in this film and i think thats something that everyone needs",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMxsGeyRtv55JYgKFRVQn_A,0.9753,positive,True

this film is made by a toy company about the toy product that made it billions of dollars and put it on the map in collaboration with one of hollywoods oldest largest studios it was never going to give feminism with fangs its about a childrens toy with the approval of its ceos who are represented as simple dudes who want to have tickle fights likecome on 

it is also a comedy made for a broad audience which again most americans are not talking about these things at length for instance my dad only cursorily knows some of this through me hes a truck driver who barely takes vacation because he cant afford it thats how most americans live 

this may be elementary to many of us but will be the first time grappling with these ideas for many and honestly its ok to refresh yourself on old concepts and have light fare about it i wouldve loved a comedy like this as a child to introduce me to these conversations in a way that presented them as safe to have i had things like legally blonde and all i wanna do growing up but this is much more pointed which is useful for girls coming up who may throw this on for a sleep over",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOwdf_jUBh8x3uV3t152Vtw,0.9887,positive,True

i didnt expect the movie to be subversive but i cant say i wasnt a tad bit disappointed the framing of ken being equally as affected by patriarchy typical centrist of both sides feminism is so tired atp but again i dont expect anything revolutionary from a toy company lmao

mattel wanted to keep the barbie brand alive by making a movie for any woman old enough to feel nostalgic about barbie not for kids yet at the theater i saw a bunch of kids the whole movie is supposed to be satire of barbie lore how little girls tend to play with barbies ex kens have no homes they are an accessory for the barbies how everything is perfect etc and satire about how ridiculous the patriarchal side of society is by showing you how ridiculous a matriarchy is in barbieland 
now the juicy stuff the whole movie is filled with  metaphors yes barbie represents a doll but she is also supposed to represent a little girl growing into a woman she realizes that her body is that of a woman and that it can be objectified now when she gets to the real world the real world represents growing up and realizing how things work how things are different than what you expected as a little girl how not everything is perfect and how you have to deal with it anyway because you are an adult the fact that she is developed and does have a vagina the realization that she will eventually age and die hence the scene with the old lady at the bus stop these are all things she already knew as a little girl but that where never at the front of her mind until now that shes growing up the margot robbie barbie represents specifically a girl that is growing up that is doubting herself and doesnt know who she is the other barbies generally know who they are or who they want to be ex doctor president etc but the main protagonist doesnt yes mattel tries to prevent havoc from occurring but it also represents how corporations target young girls and women as consumers and try to put them in boxes to solve all their problems and sell them solutions or fixed identities to make money barbie looking for answers with a corporation didnt solve anything so later in the movie she seeks answers with her creator who can very easily represent god or a mother figure telling her that yes they createdbirthed her but that she needs to be the one to decide who she is and who she wants to be barbie decides to leave fantasy land and go to the real world where she can find herself and confront reality and mature as a woman 
ken also represents a boy reaching manhood he does not represent all men he only represents those who wanted to take the easy path those who chose to keep the mentality of immature boys instead of putting in the hard work in  becoming men ken doesnt decide to find himself he ties his self worth to female attention and trying to seem more coolmasculine than other kens when he goes into the real world he doesnt feel objectified even when is being objectified and sees all attention as good attention when he goes to the real world he seeks jobs with other men lifeguard etc but these men tell him that he still  needs to put in some work to become something prepare himself learn skills etc so he decides to take the easy path instead and goes back to the fantasy world to try to gain power there by force at the end of the movie he realizes that his self worth doesnt depend on a woman that its ok that he doesnt know who he is or what he wants to do with his life yet but that he needs to try to figure it out even if it takes work
the whole movie shows that both matriarchy and patriarchy are stupid that both men and women can be shitty to eachother when they cling to eachother for self worth without at least trying to figure out who they are outside of a relationship and the work they need to put in themselves as they grow from kids to adults to face reality in other words its about both men and women maturing before they can come together in a healthy way",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2zJgV9UmStdySGobFO4g3g,0.9293,positive,True

1 the feminism of the barbie movie is definitely outdated girlbossy and overstated however id argue that maybe the film seems like that to us assuming most of us are young liberals and mostly nonmale aligning because weve already heard lots of feminist discourse from social media and stuff maybe to the average american it wouldnt seem like so redundant i live in a small town and people of all ages and political affiliations were in that movie theater so maybe to us it seems simplistic but to the greater public it may have provided a palatable and much needed discourse on feminism

2 i would be interested to hear your thoughts about the kens and their toxic and selfdestructive masculinity and how they end up waging war on each other that part of the movie was glossed over in this video and i think it has a lot to say about how the patriarchy hurts women and men on the other hand i think its possible that message went over peoples heads making it irrelevant anyway

it was campy entertaining and i enjoyed it for what it was it was disjointed and the tone gave me whiplash at times and there was no subtlety to be found 

a better ending would have been a reveal that a mom was teaching her kid about feminism using barbie dolls because thats what it felt like an instruction manual to explain why feminism matters 

but maybe it was meant to be that way maybe it was meant to shake some people still wrapped up in internalized misogyny and say look at me the patriarchy is real let me show you with crayons and barbies

kill babies

pregnant women are weird

men are obviously evil

women deserve all the power just because

the only thing men deserve is to be at the bottom and powerless because misandry feels really good especially if you label it feminism instead

any woman that wants to be with a man is brainwashed and really just doesnt know who she is

any man that wants to be with a woman is weak and really doesnt know who he is

unless of course that man wants to be with a trans who cant reproduce then its perfectly acceptable

the only way to truly be human and live a meaningful life is to hope to die as soon as possible

the matter of the fact is that society has always been about protecting women a man goes out to work to provide for a woman to build a home for her to guard and protect herbecause she is the most important one of the two he slaves so that she can be in the most comfortable situation he can muster as her role of nurturing cultivating teaching and guiding is the most crucial of the two but nomodern society ignores the thousands of years of empirical evidence in favour of the message that women need to be more authenticby copying men

the other thing is that the daughters character arc is pretty much nonexistent they dont even try to tackle her clear internalized misogyny and hatred of femininity her change of heart to want to go back and help the barbies comes out of nowhere and is caused by nothing

like when the girl calls barbie fascist i can see wokies taking that seriously instead of seeing it as the girl being a woke bully 

when barbie gets harassed affirms feminist crap ken being adored and worshipped feminist belief of patriarchy mums rant about how bad it is being a woman in todays world feminist fodder

the movies villain is literally negativity and bad vibes perpetrated by chronically online haters who masquerade as social activists the motherdaughter are not the good guys in the story ken and barbie are both grow substantially as people but still maintain the things that make them who they are

barbieland wasnt a utopia it was a flawed caricature of what a feminist society would be and was literally just an imaginary construct made up by little girls who play with the dolls when it came down to it and the kens took over everyone was still happy but things still werent quite right 

the solution was somewhere in the middle and the movie ends sort of in the rebuilding stage where the barbies and kens have to figure that part out 

the moral of the story feminist utopia  bad himbo patriarchy  bad self actualization and motherhood  good

the opening scene is meant to contrast with the final scene barbies replaced baby dolls which caused young girls to think more about physical appearance and careers than motherhood but in the end barbie herself chose motherhood over being the icon of barbieland thus flipping the notion on its head it all came full circle and the things in between were shown to be toxic because they made so many people unhappy

the message seems to me to be 

women have it harder than men and its mens fault men have it easier in the real world but its not perfect for them because the things that men do that hurt women also hurt men so men stop hurting us women and yourselves you are enough aka youre priorities do not matter you should be happy with nothing you dont need success respect or love those things are meaningless except that women should be more successful and respected and they also deserve love if they want it dont want a womans love that makes you pathetic dont want to be successful thats tyrannical dont want respect thats just your ego just be yourself what does be yourself mean you ask uh and then it ends lol

i think some well intentioned people mostly women are latching onto the vague be yourself message at the end and then projecting whatever theyd like that to mean in the end the problem is be yourself means everything and nothing when it goes undefined so basically the movie ends in a way that is intentionally vague to allow for the kind of apologetics that youre doing here to fend off deserved criticism about the films more indefensible and controversial messages thats why people have taken to calling it a rorschach test 

but the movies few moments of seeming self criticism of feminism are always undercut by a need to reinforce the central beliefs of feminist ideology it wants to be self aware but it held back by the baggage it necessarily carries to stay true to the ideology of its creators

take the annoying woke teenage daughter as an example gerwig herself says that character is the smartest in the movie and right about everything she is the writer it is not a self aware critique i guess you could take it that way but that is verifiably not what was intended

oh also capitalism is bad but maybe buying some plastic barbie shit is a good idea huh but seriously capitalism is bad except for the product placements in the movie go buy those things but honestly capitalism is bad except for all the barbie commercials for giant companies like google or gas powered cars or whatever else we can sell out to honestly if the anti capitalist fake messaging cant make you see what a hypocritical mess this movie is i dont know what could

 as shown by barbies rejection of barbieland the antimother place there were definitely moments that highlighted mens issues hence why its not so clear cut kens speech about being respected or when he was crying into the bed only to immediately say im okay with a thumbs up certainly struck a chord

there was plenty of funny moments helen mirren as the  narrator was hilarious and i had a fun time honestly my take away is either
1 the movie had a super deep message about how complicated mens rights and feminism can be its not just good vs evil
2 it was just a fun girl power movie that decided to play into the politics which were obviously going to be projected onto it anyway

though i must say that it is a rather confusing part 2 like the first part of barbenhiemer was much more tonally dark but i assume that it was portraying how the fear of communism eventually went on to create a dystopian consumeristic hellscape that had a shiny veneer of looking happy on the surface

the kens are clearly an analogy for the disenfranchised 60s housewife of powerful businesses men the barbies they have no purpose but to keep themselves pretty and live shallow lives waiting for their husbands barbies to come home and give them validation
so when ken bored housewife witnesses the most shallow surface level experience of men he then thinks that by acting like this caricature of men based on nothing but the most glossy enviable aspects of man that he is in turn qualified to be in power and lead society
when he gets back to barbieland he tells the kens women they deserve to be in all the glamorous highpowered positions in society without any mention of working the arduous or mundane jobs which they delegate out to the barbies men
the barbies rally against this and use their superior intellect to trick the kens women into bickering amongst themselves so the barbies men can take control and be in charge like god mattel intended

the only way the ending in barbieworld is a good ending is if kens story was that of an antagonist and that story begins with a what if the genders were the other way around analogy

what i really found interesting is that while patriarchy is mentioned over and over the word matriarchy isnt 

second where do the kens sleep at night the answered is raised tongue in cheek but never answered 

third for me the question remains as to why ken could install a patriarchy so fast in barbieland less than 24 hours it was clear that the writers didnt have an answer for why with the clearly adrd in line when they arrive back to barbieland how they had no natural immunity to the idea kind of like natives in the 1500s and smallpox then go on to claim that the happy barbies living in kenland are the brainwashed ones brainwashed how when they heard the idea and instantly accepted it is there not a singe philosopher barbie that might entertain logic and critical analysis enough to debate the idea or was the idea itself just so much better as you mentioned that the barbies just went for it because the matriarchy sucked  

then what happens they kidnap individual barbies andbrainwash themnana nana nana nanapatriarchy

it took far more effort to get them to accept leftwing feminist theory than it did the patriarchy

so yeah the movie is a head scratcher ultimately i just try to look at it as if the whole thing is just a fantasy playing out in the mind of a 6 year about what the world and society are like

but wait because of we dig a little deeper what this movie is about is how a society ruled by one gender is a utopia and the other gender doesnt know how good they have it and try to rise up only to mess everything up and for the dominant gender to regain power in a big heroic moment by defending the constitution its a defense of patriarchy with the genders swapped so its right then 

except is barbie really the hero like you said shes not really the focus of the movie ken is hes the one with the arc and learns to live better is the movie a tragedy that he lost in the end is it left but then the movie shows that he can be his own person even in the female dominated world and be fine without upsetting the status quo so its saying women just need to find their own way without changing the status quo but then its also saying that ken can be a strong independent man who dont need no woman so its actually about mgtow but since the roles are reversed its actually about girl power

and somehow with all the extreme reaching to make anything they like be actually about conservative values they cant seem to understand that this movie can be made to support basically any stance because its pink and thats scary to them",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNJTW-Leetym3pGnHCrLnQ,0.9706,positive,True

the opening seen captures the niche that barbie fit into in the toy market ruth handler saw girls playing with paper dolls of babies and thought that girls should have an adult model they could project their future desires into it is made clear in the film that although ruth passed away it is her spirit that informs the ceos decisions and why he refuses to simply capitalize on ken so inspite of it being an all male board of directors it is a womans spirit that drives the company there is also a scene where ken beats himself up and laments his existence without barbie like a true simp and his arch is basically to stop being a simp for barbie meanwhile barbie does go on to become the midge of the real world and this is punctuated by america ferreras character saying it should be okay for barbie to be a mother or a lawyer and a mother or just a mother

i think one of the least appreciated scenes in the film is when the kens play push by matchbox 20 for 4 hours to all of the barbies this is interesting because on the surface it sounds like they are singing about patriarchy however the song is actually about a female pushing a man around the song is sung from the perspective of one of rob thomas exes when it was originally released there was protest by feminists who didnt understand the song until it was explained by the lyricist in this scene while the kens are singing this song they seem to be singing about barbie pushing them around and at the very same time the barbies are engaged in psychological manipulation of the kens in order to regain power rob thomas was reportedly consulted on the use of the song in the film as he had concerns about the context it would be used but was okay with it after he learned that it was used in the right context",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQIpJqfn3Rr5NYS1HXZ8xA,-0.8663,negative,True

the movie did a spectacular job of displaying the contradictions inherent in what is described as patriarchy and how this system can make no sense to an outsider it contrasts this with very real and firsthand experience of what this system does to women and even offers a way out  something inconceivable to your average feminist theorist this movie breaks ground in several ways and is a massive social leap forward in addition to being actually kind of good  almost unheardof for a modern hollywood blockbuster",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9SzgepEKLS-mStjFgdETpA,0.2798,positive,True

in todays society many factors where women are oppressed are hidden for example when ken asked the one guy if being a man wasnt enough to get a job and the response was something like its still the same we just hide it better 
as a man myself i see stuff like that in real life too there are many things where women are oppressed and societal pressure and indoctrinated lies over centuries make it really hard to notice such things and to actually grasp how bad the situation is
thats why we need people that talk about the discrimination so the discriminated people can actually realize how bad their position is or that it is a systemic issue and not just them being bad at life or something
and my interpretation of the movie is that the part where the human woman ended the brainwashing should showcase that if someone starts to question the system and the oppressed people unite to change something its possible to get a better outcome",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPeUWDXB39a0pwoaapfiXg,-0.9542,negative,True

my understanding was that the movie did not try to make the other barbies seem happy while in kens patriarchy it tried to make them as dumb as the kens barbie could be president but put herself in a position only to please a ken ego i felt it was like how feminist women sees beatiful women andor who get along with men pretty well smiling fool and pitful
about ken interests finally showing it was not just a movie ken was interested it was obvious and pradictable a movie where a men display power barbies fake incompetence and kens make total fool of themselves believing to be competent heroes helping ladies in distress its just a display of selfaggrandizement
the real world girl is used both ways she may portray a woke angry annoying teenagers calling everything facist as a critic but it does not tell she is wrong in fact the mother speech resonantes with her daughers they both talk about unreasonable standards for women and how society pressure them with those where i watched the movie the reaction to the girl speech was laugh while barbie was crying not shock on the other hand the overall reaction with the mother speech i heard while it was happening was women girls saying out loud so true exactally  thats it  omg yes in other words i think the girl is not exactly a critic it is more like i think youre annoying but you are not wrong
in the end of the movie its not like the barbies recognize kens have almost no place in barbieland president barbie says we will grant you as much power as women have in the real world and kens were happy with it which landed in the audience like a joke",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXwD5kgIFoFu3v5krTOTQng,0.9869,positive,True
70009,@Longknife,1/8/2023,15:59:05,0,"i think the final statement about it being a rorschach test is the most apt summaryand also the most depressing realization

if its a rorschach test this implies the movie is heavily up to interpretation for example one could interpret the barbies enjoying kenworld but suffering from brainwashing as evidence speaking against the patriarchy or one could argue that everyone was perfectly happy and harmonious until the idea they were brainwashed came along disputing the brainwashing as a fact and instead seeing it as an insidious explanation that causes discourse

i think at this point one has to sort of accept its a wash and either accept the movie is making fun of everyone and shouldnt be taken too seriously or that its just not that deep and likewise shouldnt be taken too seriously

but instead were not doing that everyone is choosing to selectively acknowledge only the parts that support their side which in my opinion says more about the viewers themselves than the film 

it paints this picture where we as a society do not need to take the movie this seriously or try to extract some deep philosophical meaning from it and can instead have fun with it and laugh at everyone or no one but instead were so god damned divided and hyperpolitical that we choose to try and argue why a friggin movie about a toy product is this big gotcha moment against our political opponents and thats depressing",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKtrXNpTDNMoongB4QCnYYw,0.8909,positive,True

after amy pascal left in 2015 due to the fallout from the sony email hack the rights were lost in around 201819 because they were attempting to get rewrites and approvals for the amy schumer version of the movie then an anne hathaway version before the deal fell out and mattel went to wb instead 

the gerwig version is the latest incarnation which is odd because it probably had access to the early 20141719 rewrites and drafts which is why it might have a lot of old and reused ideas like will ferrel from the 2014 lego movie as the villain they likely wanted ferrel to be the villain in both movies as a nod to the movies",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC14H-8bzxNfgjfIS3bqXhog,0.7003,positive,True

i also adored how inclusive the movie was and i didnt feel like the inclusivity wad forced down my throat like other movies do what i didnt like about the kendom was that it was handled rather poorly and there could be more thought put into it but in the end of the day this movies main audience are young kids and women driven by nostalgia my aunt is a literal barbie enthusiast before the movie she asked me to take a picture of her while she was wearing a shirt with the barbie logo punk jeans and pausing with the most beautiful barbie doll i ever see and touched i enjoyed this movie with all of my heart and i got to create a wonderful memory with my family that i will cherish forever",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7oUcmOi8PvfFem38VA4ZfA,0.9912,positive,True

when i watched it i immediately saw the parallel worlds they built patriarchy and matriarchy i thought i knew what was coming next a progressive pro female empowerment film with a side dose of put the men in womens shoes and have the male viewers see the female perspective of someone who not much expected of and lives a shallow existence not by choice ken
but that idea changed when ken literally starts the real world equivalent of the feminist movement in barbieland barbie comes back and says something like this is so much change so quickly at seeing the changes all the kens made i was blown away at that point that comment wasnt a mistake i was convinced that was the heart of the film a story for personal development for margot robbie character and ken as a tool for retelling gender rights movement in a different way gender swap i was fucking sold because its really an inventive story and left that to be interpreted by the viewer
so again what i think comes next
with women being the demographic for this film of course its going to be gender equality in barbie land and its going to be done right because again i thought i knew who the film was targeting
fuck no again the kens maybe get political representation if they work hard for itearn it like what the fuck barbie land goes back to barbie land as if nothing happened so barbieland is literally just going to follow the same pathway for mens equality that the real world did with women that isnt a progressive ending for the kens story line at all it seemed like a retelling of real world gender equality struggle

70726,@CouchRadish,31/7/2023,17:40:04,557,"one of the biggest disconnects is when people talk about how happy the barbies were in the kendom they forget that the kens liked barbieland too hell mention to guys that they could live in a world where all they do is workout be hot and do beach and theyd see it as freedom from the isolating feeling that responsibilities can give you and thats really a major point of the movie the ideas of the matriarchypatriarchy hurts people  even the ones who are believed to benefit the most from it

margots barbie is the stereotypical barbiewho is both everything and nothing shes a concept of perfection the quintessential barbie that all other barbies have branched off from but shes an unattainable concept of perfection because there is nothing that defines her outside of the external forces that decide for her shes just like ken when he says i dont exist outside your gaze she doesnt exist outside ours she has nothing to define herself with

and that leads to the movies biggest message that gender identity cannot be a substitute for selfidentity barbie is crushed by the expectations of her perfect matriarchy and is socially threatened with exile if she does not return to meeting those expectations

ken embraces his idea of what the patriarchy is because it acknowledged and validated him he only defined his worth in relation to barbie but now defines it by some superficial ideas of masculinity that dont actually fix his deeper issues of a lack of any sort of identity

like how the movie says barbie has a great day every day ken only has a great day of barbie looks at himnow barbie doesnt always have to have a great day and ken can have a great day without depending on barbie",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK1TDe78ye_AsF8DhJOZQog,0.9917,positive,True

70819,@potato_oni7597,31/7/2023,16:39:36,5,"actually your joke analysis of the ending is fairly accurate funnily enough i immediately felt that ending was familiar and yep its literally just wings of desire wich i later learned greta gerwig cites as one of the main influences for the movie

i feel the biggest problem with people not understanding barbies character arc is them comparing it to kens his is very straight forward hes underappreciated thinks he finds a way to fix that realizes hes not happy after all and then learns to not be so codependent because his real issue was that he couldnt be with barbie the way he was meant to be thats a pretty good arc but barbies is a different beast alltogether 

in the movie barbies are depicted as somewhat empty vessels acting and behaving based on their themes and what the children playing with them in the reals world project onto them stereotypcial barbie starts off as the perefect one who can potentially be and do anything and once she starts to malfunction she wants to do anything to return to her status quo but in attempting to do so shes exposed to more and more the real world most importantly a glimpse into the moms memories the good ones and the bad ones wich starts to affect her in a similiar way as playing with her would exposing her to a new pov on existence that in turn builds up over the course of the movie culminating in her decisions to become human and leaving barbieland behind wich she now views as providing an ultimately shallow existence again literally wings of desire

basicly barbie gets redpilled by a middleaged mom by being exposed to her life experience long before her rant of wich i only disliked that it wasnt performed more angry and exhasuted like she was bottling that up for years or even meeting ruth the matrix reference wasnt just there to be cute 

kens struggle is fast paced and against external forces the barbie controlled system but really his barbie not sharing his level of affection while barbies is more of a slowburn internal one against her own expactations and biases both character arcs are however are united in the message of not basing your own identiy and self worth solely on your relationship to others and what others expect of you 

the other message ive got from the movie was that any form of gender based hierarchy is bad no matter if it matriarchy or patriarchy because it always ends up putting one group down the only part where it didnt really clicked with me was the fact that the kens are underappreciated but are otherwise doing fine like if i had the choice between ruling the real world or being a ken in barbieland id say take my dick now without hesitation the barbies shouldve been more unpleseant to the kens imo its also not really a happy ending for the kens because at best they can hope for some benfits but never real equality 

atleast they arent being tortured because appearently thats what every little girl actually does with their kens irl

also the whole subtext of the barbies and kens is that they only ever have a very surface level or childish understanding of concepts case in point barbieland is a superficial interpretation of feminism its literally girlboss as a plane of existence while kendomland ends up being a superficial interpretation of patriarchy basicly tateland i actually liked that subtle bit of world building alot because otherwise the movie wouldve been waaaaaayyyy less whimsical and also like 58 hours long 

and i dont think they gave that much credit to mattel in the movie theyre depcited as a soulless company staffed by almost robotic employees honestly i thought theyd turn out to be toys too in the end but nope with extremly superficial lip service to female empowerement and only interested in keeping their brand stagnant and thus safely profitable thats why the ceo is loosing it when ken stuff starts selling its against their brand  even the depression barbie commercial wich is such an old joke theres almost a decade old yt vids of it makes fun of the fact that mattel will make a barbie variant of everything just to turn a profit it also reminded me a little of the commercials in robocop wich made me smile

theyre joke villains and funnily enough have a similiar motivation of vought in the the boys comic just selling never changing comics and nothing else they changed it massively for the show

a big suprise to me and almost everyone else was that mattel actually signed off on putting a remix of barbie girl by aqua in the end credits like they actually sued the group over that song ages ago thats how much they hate it

also uhmmm shoe i i hate to break it to you but your boyfriends take makes it sound to me like might be a widdle bib wetardet like theres a lot of directions you can go with this but conservative is not even close neoliberal at most but even then

anyway i really liked the movie and agree that its nice to see something more colourful for a change the mattel executive stuff couldve been cut down in favour of developing gloria and sasha more but otherwise its a big tub of fun with some really good messages and an oddly sarcastic undertone to it wich i appreciated because it gave me some very mild shrek vibes 

i give the movie and 810 very solid high score with some problems here and there

sadly but predictably mattel learned the wrong lesson from it instead of choosing a good creative team can elevate even the most basic franchise movie to something great they now think about puking a fuckload of movies into the theaters because they believe itll be an automatic success the only one im excited for is heman but nothing else but only if the trailer features the cast singing whats up

and just for the record compliments dont work on me at all whenever someone gives me one i think mkay and move on with my life and its not like im usually showered with compliments its super rare i guess its either cultural or me being autistic but over here i dont see men being as attention starved as it seems to be the case in the us",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2u8ZWQPJPRXudDTKu2UFQ,0.9986,positive,True

i think this movie is more of a be ordinary and be yourself movie this is why at the end of the movie an ordinary barbie is proposed and barbie doesnt go get a job to be a girlboss but instead just to a gynecologist and maybe barbie just wants to be a mother 
while the patriarchal system in barbieland is obviously portrayed as bad the movie gives ken time to realize that he can live a life without barbie he can fend for himself and take time to find himself while the patriarchy is obviously bad the barbiematriarchy isnt that much better it caused the kens to be unhappy and an intense course correction that wasnt the right choice either
also i dont think that the barbies used the loyalty of the kens to cause infighting but rather the idea that a man needs to be tethered to a woman
you can clearly see this motif troughout the movie in the beginning kens whole purpose is barbie while she gets to do what she wants then the barbies whole purpose is to cater to the kens while they do what they want and then of course the infighting ken needs to be cut lose and find his own way he and barbie need to find their own way
i think the movie maybe unwillingly shows that all these expectations to be a girlboss arent always the way to go some want to be ordinary and  a man doesnt need a woman he can be an individual with his own goals and ambitions

and while it sounds silly if you listen to what billie eilish is singing during the climax of the movie it is obvious that the person singing never stepped outside of their bubble their bubble burst and now they need to find themself and it could take a long time also talking about how she cant tell her boyfriend that shes sad because its not what hes made for because of societal expectations thematically the way it always was 
it however needs to be said that while both versions of barbieland werent really the best way to go the kens actively used the barbies instead of just ignoring them like the barbies did to the kens giving this movie a feminist tint",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGFIQRUdjlyYpoHM6S8uMpQ,-0.9514,negative,True

its an interesting observation when ken installs the patriarchy the barbies and ken actually interact with each other
there was that subtext i think that movie was like a child engaging in play the beginning is like a elementary school age girls idea of boys being icky and the girls have zero interest in the kens or romance later that changes perhaps ken didnt actually bring patriarchy back but instead brought maturity and the idea the world doesnt exist just for you",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp8PvZbDd69kDrK-FD9D47A,0.967,positive,True

the kens maybe were nice but they were also patronizing and the ryan gosling ken is a creepy incel who does not take rejection well like many real men do and women get in awkward situations because of it the movie establishes that the patriarchy exists in the real world by asking ken for credentials for work i think thats the writers way of addressing some of the criticisms as yours yes just because youre a man doesnt make you rule the world you need credentials but that doesnt mean that the patriarchy doesnt exist on some level 

the movie never states that barbie land is perfect it is a hyper level matriarchy to the point where credentials are not needed as much as the real world and the kens dont hold any relevant positions even if they were a minority the movie clearly makes a joke about that when in the later scenes one of the barbies say that the kitchen kind of progress theyre planning on is for men to have rights equivalent of womens in the real world

on one hand you could argue that is anti feminism because the barbies dont do a better job than the men did they suppress the kens they learn contrast and an even happier existence and barbie  the real villain of the movie comes back and destroys the new found way of difference remember in the 50s and 60s lots of women and many still do  liked being a mother  staying home and pleasing their man it want perfect but the family unit did have many societal advantages  they use female toxicity to regain power and miss the opportunity to have any sort of equality 
where as there was no malice with kens kendom it was too easy to make it so

if the concept of real life girls and grown women that abuse their barbies their would be legs falling off barbies at the party and doc barbie would be needed then no consistency in the plot so much of makes little sense but i guess thats part of the funwtf is it really about people will be debating about it for years

as pointed out by many this situation is not an inversion of the real world especially the western world this is worse than the worst real world examples even in the most extreme misogynist cultures women dont have it this bad they are part of their culture and respected at least as mothers and domestic partners kens have no role they are property 

ken when he sees a world where men are treated as better than slaves does the heroic thing and goes back to barbie world to free his people yes is literally mgtow moses maybe he read some jordan peterson he is in fact so capable that he does this nearly instantly with almost no resistance on the part of the barbies what do the kens do when they gain absolute power do they enslave the barbies or force them into sexual slavery to get even no they give themselves the same rights the barbies had and form a democratic government pure evil if you ask a feminist evidently the barbies for their part go along with it and claim that they are happier than ever they dont ask to be saved and why not they actually have a chance at relationships now and have equals but we cant have that now can we 

so what does basic bitch barbie do to fix this does she use reason and arguments to persuade enough kens to change the laws she hates back to how they were before ie unequal in her favor no she teaches the barbies modern feminist theory and works to fortify the election by denying the kens a right to vote and advocate for themselves how do the barbies do this by resorting to using their sexuality to trick the kens into turning on each other yes by reinforcing the worst stereotypical aspects of women resorting to prostitution they use their sexual attractiveness to promise kens a real relationship if they fight each other during the vote now remember for some reason there are more kens than barbies in barbieworld i guess to do all of the manual labor so this is effectively a mirror of the coastal elites imposing their world view on the rest of the country very meta",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEW8z40O9z4Uw7bsPiRoT4w,-0.8664,negative,True

youve got the patriarchy which they were on the nose about but also how throughout the movie the kens were competing against each other in macho shows of superiority for the attention of the barbies which made it funny that they went to war with each other over women but 5min later were holding hands and made peace for the bromance based on the stereotype that men can come together easily while women hold grudges they had conquered their toxic masculinity by releasing their emotions and frustrations in a way that translates for them beaching each other off which barbie had shut down at the beginning of the movie

barbieland is obviously a caricatured mirror of the real world where women rule but as the female influence is greater so is the presence of toxic femininity they openly segregate and ostracise the other barbies gatekeep they dont even know where the kens live but it doesnt matter because girls night come first girlboss but most damning we have the liberationgaslighting scene their grand plan is to manipulate the kens by asking about their interests asking for help on a topic they know about and asking to hear their favourite song the absolute gall of these idiot kens barbieland if it was in any other movie would have been a facade a thin layer of pretense that hid a sickening truth buried beneath but theyre barbies not womenhumans so there was nothing hidden to reveal

72553,@SYSRQLLQRSYS,31/7/2023,2:44:38,0,"spoiler alert
this dense wall of text may contain some spoilers but it takes more than a quick gaze to understand that what youre reading is a spoiler
also if i didnt directly mention something shoe says in this video in the points below know that it means that either i dont care enough to talk about it or that i agree with it
id like to preface this by saying just because i understand the message of this film doesnt mean i agree in it wholeheartedly i will explain at the end

1 you describe the politics of this movie as the most tired libshit corpo tumblr male tears and generally a repetitive and what i think youre getting it unoriginal lecture about feminist issue i think thats the whole point the fact that it has become such a repetitious monologue in society says a lot about how women are still judged unfairly in the world because theyre women it is a cry for help and nobody is listening not even some women
2 you also highlight the fact that there are many many women in powerful positions in our global society and also sarcastically ask hows that working out which to me sounds like a great example of when the movie says that women hate women it feels like youre trying to say we have a lot of women in our government our government is shit so it must be that women are contributors to the governments failings hows that working out im pretty sure youre not saying that women are the cause of government failure but thats what it could sound like to viewers who might be mysoginists
3 you mention that the kens representation make them subservient to the barbies their selfesteem solely based on how barbies see them i think the point is that specifically with respect to the kens social class within the barbie world society is actually a direct representation of how women are classed in society even women hate women  a line from the movie and kens hate kens constantly competing against each other for the mere presence of barbies a major evidence for this is the narrator saying something to the effect of the kens will gain equality in barbie world when women gain equality in the real world
35 i think ken gets attention in barbie world its just that his self worth is so deeply rooted in the attention of barbie that literally any normal amount that they spend away from each other seems disproportionately longer than reality which is another reason why i think ken social class directly represents real life womens social class
352 kens amazement to the level of respect that he receives in the real world is the exact same amazement that real life women would have if they were in barbie world we actually do briefly see this in the movie when the mother daughter duo goes to barbie land barbie tells them all the cool womenfocused their society is until ofc they realize that ken has essentially brought on a coup of the barbie government
4 you mention how ken assumes that in the patriarchal society the ceo still requires him to have some credentials like education experience etc which as you sarcastically point out that it doesnt really prove that patriarchy is ridiculous but forget to mention that right after that the ceo admits that they absolutely do the patriarchy thing but that they just hide it better im trying really hard to believe that this video isnt intentionally being disingenuous but youre really not helping by omitting a crucial part of that very same scene
5 the daughter the one you describe essentially as a bully is just a regular angry teenager one thing that a lot of angry teenagers these days latch on to is being woke which i def agree i think her character isnt really a representation of woke mindset and more of a disenchantment of the more old school girlpower rhetoric which barbie represents i think she represents the more leftist less liberal mindset of capitalists will use any means necessary to dominate including creating what essentially is a virtuesignalling cry of empowerment by way of the barbie doll 
55 this point is more of a criticism of what seems to be a plothole not so much a criticism of the message in its entirety initially when the daughter calls barbie a fascist i was taken aback by how baseless this accusation was but as the plot developed into the 3rd act we do see barbie essentially use the kens insecurities to render them unable to vote which is a literal act of fascism at this point we have to assume that the barbies were always capable of this which begs the question if the barbies mentality is supposed to somewhat reflect the mentality of the human that plays with them does that mean all the children that play with barbies are fascists again this point is a fairly minor nitpick because if you think about it the plothole doesnt really contradict the main message in that it is no where near related to the messages of the film unless you believe that women are fascists
6 another reason why i have a suspicion that shoe is being disingenuous in this video is that she describes the barbie in the postkenification of barbie world as much happier than they were before this is absolutely not the case the first day in barbies life we literally see them having having complete autonomy of themselves theyre partying with kens theyre at the beach constantly saying hi to each other in the postkenification of barbie world you see barbies literally being completely subservient to the kens essentially serving as their maids but still smiling completely because theyre brainwashed the movie isnt saying that if a woman ever decides to serve men that they are brainwashed only that in the context of the postkenified barbie world the barbies are brainwashed because theyre serving kens something they never otherwise would have before the brainwashing the barbies autonomy has been taken out and to describe that situation as the barbies being much happier is truly a blatant lie one of the lines of the brainwashed barbie is literally i like being a helpful decoration theres no way you hear that from someone and even consider that they are in a much happier place 
65 you mention how one of the barbies says out loud that its nice to take a break from being a leader all the time i cant find this quote in the movie if anyone knows let me know
7 the examples you say about how the patriarchified kens are just being sweet and nice are things that the kens think what barbies want again it takes the autonomy away from barbies in that activity literally the one time that the kens do something for themselves and not for others they are so filled with catharsis after articulating in a song number how theyre feeling until they remember that their main goal was about to be disrupted by the barbies in the first place if the kens didnt force the barbies in this idealized world view that they have for them and just focused on self discovery the way they did on that song number they would have no need for patriarchy
 
so after number 7 i got tired of watching her talk about the same thing that i was finding to be incredibly disingenuous saying that the barbies were happy postkenification of barbie world she mentions something about how the guerrilla political tactics of barbies to try and get the kens to fight each other so they are unable to vote is the movie saying that its sending a message of anti monogamy

everything she says after my 7th point im choosing not to say anything about because it feels like too much effort for the return like if you read this up to point 7 and youre still not convinced that this movie actually has a good message then 34 more points arent going to convince you you will believe what you will believe regardless of how thick the bias lens with which you see the movie really is",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2NrCDWbWxoa0RRyI-acUaw,0.9886,positive,True

72650,@beblazeblue93,31/7/2023,2:24:21,0,"so i think the disconnect from the movie comes from a lot of the doubletakes and unreliable narration for bits throughout a bunch you have to keep in mind who is saying what and also what is said about them and their understanding of either world

the intro is what barbie thought they were doing until she went to the real world and runs into teen girl who was mad at her for basically existing teen girl btw who called her fascist right before the scene where barbie says shes not and explains why almost reminding the viewer this is not what this means i think teen girl is basically a standin for internet feminism talks for that reason

as far as patriarchy they mention it a few points in the movie the biggest takeaways i got about that were in part in the ending speech with the barbie creator where she says patriarchy among other things arent real theyre just how we deal with hard lives 

before then i noticed a lot of how the kens were treated and even down to a few verbatum lines in the movie is more or less what if men and women had flipped roles leading to a lot of extreme feminism but for men in this case as we have irl and the barbies being standins in barbie world for how men are irl like a decent chunk of kens lines and what is said about ken reminds me of how we used to think about women and a lot of kens extreme takes reminds me of more or less extreme feminism takes we have today

firstly i want to disagree with how some people are saying that oh no cartoon movies having political messages is badeven back then in the socalled good old days films and shows had political messages its only wokedun dun dun if you disagree with said message and basedwhen you do film and tv shows are a form of art a medium of expression and art evolves with the world i want to express that all art forms have a form of societal messaging one way or another and its pretty stupid to expect all shows to be perfect pure escapes from reality the goodshows are just the ones that either didnt have the guts to tackle more complex serious issues or are the ones that do but fail and get scapegoated for it 

secondly even as a feminist i have to say that this movie wasnt about feminism it wasnt even woke so you can put your pitchforks down about gender studiesand white women badand woke  bad its a critique of both modernday feminism and of patriarchy yes ken dismantled the matriarchy within a day and barbie dismantled the patriarchy within a day too by turning the men against each other both matriarchy and patriarchy are so arbitrary and easily destroyed and yes barbie wasnt good to ken at all but in the end what struck me the most was how barbie said maybe its barbieand its ken which highlighted how both patriarchy and matriarchy tear men apart and pit them against each other barbie was literally apologising for her toxicity and admitting her mistake in seeing ken as superfluous and encouraging ken to go on his own journey to discover his own identity she eventually saw ken as his own person a direct parallel to how men in the real world are beginning to see women as their own people heck even in the end the narrator said that maybe one day the kens will have equal rights as barbies just like one day the same will happen for women

i honestly loved ken in this movie im just kenwas so beautiful to me i can genuinely understand where hes coming from and this movie highlighted to me how patriarchy can come about from a sense of helplessness and actually made me sympathise with kens case after being so helpless his whole life at the same time i would hardly say this movie was trying to paint ken as the bad guy or even barbie as the good guy the most important line in my honest opinion was people create things like patriarchy and barbie to deal with how excruciating it is to be human it shows how both patriarchy and feminism and matriarchy are inherently arbitrary constructs made to cope with our own loneliness and emptiness

ken an objectively oppressed male with no confidence who starts out as a pathetic simp gets one tiny dose of confidence by going to the real world which is just as fake and cartoonish as barbieland and then goes back to his world and managed to literally overthrow the entire government by himself in only a day or two tops 

ken then makes a society where men are confident masculine and strong and women are feminine and happy housewives and dont have to be girlbosses and even they are treated with way more respect than the kens ever were 

and things work out fine for everyone until margot robbie barbie decides she doesnt like this and lies gaslights and emotionally manipulates all the kens into world war 1 while they seize power through a coup which also doesnt make any sense cause ken supposedly took over by force meaning an official vote would be irrelevant and theres nothing stopping them from taking over by force once again

and then instead of learning any lessons about gender equality and eliminating the idea of a matriarchy or even a supposed patriarchy which is really just any conservative american town they go right back to matriarchy and oppressing the kens even though the barbies literally have no power or military to enforce their laws and nothing to stop the kens from taking over by force once again

and ken unironically is supposed to be the villain of the movie the kens arent even an allegory of  gender swapped patriarchy because if that was the case then greta gerwig would be in full support of patriarchy and would be telling women to just stay in the kitchen and stop trying to be girlbosses as was the case with ken no she unironically is in full support of female supremacy and treats it as if its the correct message in the movie

now i understand why everyone calls the barbie movie accidentally antiwoke only the most insane leftist woke feminist could be so backwards in their thinking they go a full 180 and unintentionally destroy the very message they intended to tell in ten years greta gerwig will be trying to sell this as a gender equality movie that celebrates both men and women instead of the insane feminist fantasy she intended it to be",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUf9gTX7qtqVit16Q4brBw,-0.1974,negative,True

humans make things up like patriarchy and barbie just to deal with how uncomfortable it is

basically saying that in order to cope with the ambiguous things of the world we make things up moving onto what is to me my favorite part of the entire movie after rhea pearlman admits to the patriarchy being a fake concept to cope with the difficulties in the world barbie has a vision of what she wants in life a vision of her future per se and its not being this girl boss toxic feminist icon pushing agendas in the public its motherhood to be a mother to raise a child to have a family to experience the beauty of parenthood and express her love and kindness onto those around her the film doesnt shy away from demonstrating that both men and women have been castrated by the feminist culture and propaganda all the things the women complain about in barbie land and the real world are complaints about what feminism has done not tradition the final scene in the movie barbie doesnt go get this big new job in the real world she goes to see her gynecologist while its a surface level joke and i get some people didnt like this scene but its a deeper joke that ties in with the rest of the movie and themes demonstrating that what really matters is motherhood when you think about it thats the first step to becoming a mother to raising children and starting a family so while yes it made some people uncomfortable but i found that quite beautiful there is a scene with america ferrera where she speaks to the mattel executives and says how she doesnt want a barbie thats the president or an astronaut or entrepreneur but a barbie that is just a mother thats okay with just being a mother thats just trying to make it through the day pretty profound stuff am i reading deeper into the film or making up my own interpretation well what makes more sense that greta gerwig in all her films incorporates deeply meaningful themes and points or does it all without a clue you tell me if thats on purpose or not barbie is not a support of feminism its a wake up call to realize just how bad its gotten and im glad there is a film out there that can appeal to girls have something to say to boys and support the traditional culture weve always been founded on",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChK0RW8WjaA7YGPTdCJVWDg,0.9887,positive,True

yet simultaneously she loved barbie and her and my mother have been discussing how relevant the film is to the oppression of women
i couldnt understand how one could witness their father curled up into a ball crying as his wife screams at him and still believe in a mythological evil patriarchy
but perhaps the female hive mind overrides hatred between individual women
ive noticed that despite my sisters hatred for my mother she would always panic if i was ever vaguely assertive with her despite her and my mother at times coming to physical blows i believe this is because women fear the implication of a man standing up to a woman a fear that if one individual man stands up to a woman it could start a domino effect in which all men begin standing up to women which would result in women collectively losing their way of life",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBF86YL2AN7ERBiZ05egfew,-0.9934,negative,True

from the outset the movie feels like a trojan horse disguising its heavyhanded agenda of perceived male hatred and an obsession with dismantling the patriarchy the supposed empowerment narrative turns out to be a thinly veiled manbashing exercise that trades humor for misguided messages about sexism and patriarchy even the barbieken romance is undermined perpetuating a narrative that emasculates male characters rather than promoting healthy equal relationships

as the plot unfolds the movie takes an unexpected turn with barbies struggle with menopause a topic that feels disconnected and adds to the films lack of coherence the portrayal of ken as a deranged antagonist and the subsequent attempt to establish a matriarchal society in barbie land further detract from the movies credibility

the films failure to balance entertainment with meaningful storytelling exposes larger issues within hollywood as it appears more focused on pushing biased feminist agendas than fostering creativity and joy the movies divisive and biased messages are harmful doing a disservice not only to young girls and women but also to men and families

moreover the films lgbtq connotations may not be inherently problematic but their execution and portrayal could be concerning particularly when aimed at a young audience it is essential to approach such themes with sensitivity and thoughtfulness considering the ageappropriateness of the content and its potential impact on young minds

in conclusion i cannot recommend barbie to anyone seeking an enjoyable and meaningful cinematic experience the films promotion of the fifth wave of feminism seems to have lost sight of what true empowerment means for both women and men it is a shame that such potential for a masterpiece was squandered by the directors agendadriven approach highlighting the broken state of hollywood today this film could have been great but it ultimately falls flat echoing the problematic trends seen in some disney films as well

considering its flaws i would advise against letting young audiences especially nieces and daughters watch this film instead we should seek content that promotes genuine empowerment and fosters positive values",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqgVepXxYoYmtR8OBJUJ_iA,0.9755,positive,True

then i saw quite a few people online hating the movie but not for the reasons i thought its political its a feminist movie it dumps on men it encourages capitalism its inappropriate subject matter for any human being 
im a woman and i find 90 of feminist movies garbage not because i wont want women to be heard but because theyre badly written misrepresent women dunk on men to get a point across and the creators get angry at people who dont like it and yeah its become very uninviting for any movie to talk about this subject not because its wrong to talk about it but because the people who talked about it first got it all wrong in my opinion
so my family and my gf and her family gathered to see it i was expecting to be on that same boat 
i loved it
omg this movie is so creative and so fun and so heartwrenching and its such a relatable beautiful take on understanding life and its meaning and its a wholesome love letter to the world and barbies influence and the music and the set designs and the beach fight at the end yeah this ended up being my favorite movie of the year and i am so upset i expected the worst from it 
even the feminism stuff didnt bother me like i thought it would because for once i actually felt heard i actually related to it all and it was something my gf needed to hear at the time because she was in a pretty rough spot when we saw it this movie helped her see value in herself and facing her problems i also flat out disagree with the antimen thing cause i see a lot of men in the comments saying they related to the movie hard as well and i never got the impression when watching the movie it honesty opened my eyes to mens struggles in the patriarchy which is welcome to me if anything the movie is about both genders struggles and how real world expectations destroy us from the inside and i think its brilliant

to understand what i mean you need to flip the roles so instead of the barbie being in charge its ken but not in the way that ken is depicted taking power later in the film with that in mind follow the plot of the film and its barbie that realizes there is more to just standing around waiting for the attention of ken its barbie that brings that idea back to the other barbies now the barbies take the controlling power from the kens making the world into what is depicted as their ideal world something terrible shown to the audience its up to ken to take back the power tricking the barbies and restoring order the kens then tell the barbies they cant be equal but they can start at a lower level and work their way up

basically the movie with the roles reversed their is still the terrible skew in power and lack of equality but i guess its okay because barbie
what would have been better is not going so heavy handed on stereotypical toxic masculinity and patriarchy rather something that shows the inequality in world and why it exists we know barbies world is the way it is because the real world lacks the equality barbieland is an overcorrection meant to empower girls but its fake because it possibly cant be that way right ken seeing what the real world is like takes this information back to the other kens most of the kens start protesting for more equality a few of the kens decide to take power its up to barbie and the humans to restore order and take down the power tripping faction of kens barbie and the humans manage this with help from the kens that respect the barbies and allan now rather than barbie just giving ken a lower level position and saying they can start there its barbies offering the educate the kens and move towards a more equal society not just giving them something and see how it goes there is a mutual respect at the very least potential for it the stereotypical toxic masculinity kens that tried to take power are sent to jail or some other punishment mattel starts a line of kens or some other toy geared to boys that help promote equality and respect it doesnt sell well and the real mattel could do that line a toys along with the release of the film maybe it does sell well maybe it doesnt stereotypical barbie realizes she can be so much more and her ending is the same

i do see progress through the generations especially on my moms side my grandma stayed home once she had kids because thats what you did and probably ended up resenting it my mom had more freedom but lacks confidence in herself and there was a level of gender equality in how my brothers and i were raised but im still the oldest daughter and that still affected the expectations i faced and still face and my husband and i are still trying to figure out what gender equality looks like in our marriage because weve both been conditioned since we were young about what men and women do and its hardeven though we both agree on gender equality as a concept",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_7Qnrv_Scy2_f7ZplpE2w,0.9771,positive,True

im not a fan of the barbie movie because it leaves ground for male speeches like yours that revel in the fact that a certain piece of media affirmed some ideal view that men are not the oppressive class for which patriarchy is created and enforced it sets a certain priority that whatever oppression women may be faced with we have to think of a way to keep honoring men as we talk about sexism and misogyny ingrained in our society as were not allowed to shed our roles of always catering to mens emotional needs just yet contrary to popular belief denying that men are the main problem in patriarchy like other obvious facts about the struggles women face sets feminism back and will not move it forward it purposefully holds us back in a social paradigm where a traditional malefemale hierarchy can still be held intact even in the movement thats supposed liberate women from that psychology we can pretend all we want that there are five other top things that oppress women in patriarchy for their benefit i for sure wouldnt know what and i like many other feminists would rather men like you arent a part of feminism than are

im actually offended by the statement its a movie by women with women for women its not a movie for women what has changed by the end of the movie nothing nothing has improved oh sorry something has changed now barbie has a vagina everyone forgot about her gyn appointment so basically now she can metaphorically and literally get fucked isnt that what women are for anyway if you want that watch first cow the men represented in this movie by a women do more for feminism than barbie or any blockbuster please promote smaller productions if you really want to promote cinema and women directors

instead of showing actually making you feel what being a women in this world is how bad it still is they make a list of the contradictory expectations the world has for women the list is true yes but weve known the list for decades and has it changed anything no so why do it again if you dont make people feel this contradictions they wont remember them an hour after the movie ends see rachel in money heist we can feel so strongly how shes made to feel in her job lost in this sea of men were she has to be perfect even though some of them are rude and horrible were frustrated for her this people wont forget

but where i connected most with this film was their pointing out how unbelievably unfair the world is in its gender equality by showing it both in the real world and then reflecting it back at the real world through barbielandkendom
i have laughed so hard at this film but also felt really seen as a woman and the unfairness that is in my life purely from the chance that i was born a girl i also cried so much at the end
my favourite line is about the kens one day having as much power in barbieland as women have in the real world i think i and many others in the cinema actually applauded this line
also i absolutely love the storyline of ken i thought that was brilliant this film did not say that women deserve more because we are better than men it said women deserve more because we are people too equality does not mean pulling men down further to meet us but neither does that mean that women need to hold themselves down so as not to outshine men equality is not about being treated the exact same because not one person on this earth is the exact same as anyone else but it is about offering the same opportunities and the same respect to everyone",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkubDoPlutT4Qt_HSRU3rZw,0.9791,positive,True

i think the narrative surrounding the film its resonance driving force etc is more interesting than the film itself the substance of the message though is pretty thin imho  but what is to be expected from a film that is backed by the very company that contributed to those constructs  i guess theres something to take away but well need many more films about the place of women in society",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuujmwhBh4bYq2QES3HyFsQ,0.9833,positive,True
