      "I hated this movie. it's just toxic feminism (treating men as lessor beings, unhealthy body influence, demanding to be treated not just as equals, but better than men) This entire movie said that women our oppressed in their homes. If a woman dares to do just be a mom and a wife, she not living up to her full potential. She has to be working. And what worse is that we flip the switch and make man be oppressed. we treat them awfully. Ken whole purpose WAS to love barbie. he was literally made to be her soulmate and partner. ever sense the beginning of barbie, ken was there as her better half. that was the point. As kids, we didn't play \"free barbie from the shackles that ken has her stuck in\" we played ken and Barbie getting married, ken and Barbie have a family, even ken and barbie fight the monster. it wasn't about the freaking patriarchy or oppressed women, or \"toxic masculinity.\" It was about family and love. which the barbie movie abandoned for the sake of being Intune with what our toxic culture wants. It was supposed to lift woman up, but after watching it, I felt completely torn down and broken, because it says that I can find happiness in love. I have to find it inside myself, which is so wrong.\n",

      "\"My first impression was a very strong one,\" repeated the prince. \"When they took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German towns and looked out of the windows, but I didn't trouble myself to ask questions about them. This was after a long series of fits. I would always fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series, losing my memory almost entirely. Even though I wasn't entirely without reason during these times, I lacked the logical power of thought. This would continue for three or four days, and then I would recover myself again. I remember my melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry, sat and wondered uncomfortably. The consciousness that everything was strange weighed heavily upon me; I could understand that it was all foreign and unfamiliar. I recall waking up from this state for the first time in Basle one evening; the braying of barbie woke me up, barbie in the town market. I saw the barbie and was extremely pleased with it. From that moment on, my mind seemed to clear.\"\n",
      "\"Barbie? How strange! Yet, it's not so strange. Anyone of us might fall in love with barbie! It happened in mythological times,\" said Madame Epanchin, casting a wrathful glance at her daughters, who had started to laugh. \"Please continue, prince.\"\n",
      "\"Since that evening, I've had a special fondness for barbies. I began to ask questions about them, as I had never seen one before. I immediately came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most fascinating things—colorful, imaginative, and delightful. Thanks to this barbie, I started to appreciate the whole country I was traveling through, and my melancholy gradually faded away.\"\n",

      "The lessons about humanity, compassion, noticing the other person, what it's like to be a woman and a man and how both sexes have their own struggles and their pain deserves to be noticed,  acknowledged and praised. The final scene where Barbie both metaphorically and literally grows up and decides to become human was tearjerking, definitely the top highlight of this movie. \n",
      "\n",
      "But damn, if most of the good stuff just gets drowned in the approach of \"Telling\" instead of \"showing\". Ken's patriarchal rules that came from the place of wanting to be respected for who he/they are was a good story, telling every second sentence how \"patriarchy is bad\" was not. There are moments where this really original and refreshing movie becomes some sort of lecture which is quite possibly the most boring way to show things. Exposition by info dumps rarely end well for the one that experiences things, it makes the whole experience really shallow. \n",

From rumors of hearing that Barbie is doing a series, I must stated that the next movie must cover White Liberal Feminism/Racial Feminism. Studying where the media and culture head toward, they are becoming more and more vocal about how the media/entertainment industry has treated them. Even faster by new social media app such as TikTok and will be by newer ones. Thus, BARBIE best option to thrive is to tackle WLF. Perhaps having President Barbie experience the Real World herself and layout the differences between hers and Stereotypical Barbie on the table to find a happy medium. Or something. It wouldn’t hurt Stereotypical Barbie to share the screen with President Barbie for a movie or two. 🤎🩷🤎🩷🤎\n",

      "There's more than meets the eye in this well-made movie. The chosen actors were perfect for their roles. I loved the protagonist and the Kens.\n",
      "As opposed to our bible story, Barbie came first, then Ken. I love that idea.\n",
      "In the Barbie world, everything is perfect, pretty, and pink. But to me, it is too plastic and fake. Barbie and Ken travel to explore the real world. She becomes disappointed and saddened. She experiences emotion, a tear appears on her cheek. Ken, on the other hand, loves seeing the power and the control that men have over women and brings back these ideas into the Barbie world.\n",
      "The Barbies (referring to women’s lib) fight the Kens and regain the order of their world. Barbie, however, feels different after visiting the real world. She asks permission from her creator to go back and become human.\n",
      "At the end of the movie, Barbie, now Barbara, is back in the world visiting a gynecologist. She might be having a baby. She has fully accepted the human condition with all its ups and downs, and imperfections.\n",
      "MORAL OF THE STORY\n",
      "The movie sends several messages:\n",
      "- To reconsider American values. \n",
      "- There's nothing bad about aiming for perfection. We are all different and nobody is perfect but we can aspire to be the best version of ourselves.\n",
      "- As for the Kens, they really need to go and find themselves.\n",

      "National Cinema Day was awesome because I finally saw Barbie!  !!!SPOILER ALERT!!!  During part of the movie, I was wondering if \"Weird Barbie\" or whatever nickname Barbies gave that particular Barbie was Gymnastic Barbie.  I guess the existing Barbies were threatened in the 90s when Flat Feet Barbie aka Gymnastic Barbie was introduced to and took the world by storm.  Anyhow, the actress did an excellent job portraying high heel Barbie. Her body movements were brilliant.  I was admiring her acting very much and wondered how much she had to study the toy to practice \"Barbie moves\". Great job! Loved the movie.  It was colourful, funny, and definitely all about BARBIE and ken.  I suggest the lives of broken Barbies be a theme of the next Barbie movie.\n",

Women (mostly in your society)  They feel inferior, incompetent, and not making a change in the world, unlike men, so instead of making a greater effort, cooperation, and thinking about how to present what is useful to the world, you went to try to distort and diminish the image of the man (in a pathetic way) until he becomes at the same low level as you to feel satisfied.. This  In short, what you are trying to do from time to time, of course, nothing will change and we do not care, but since you are tired of trying and now you are heading to the children here, people should stop you, because this will affect people’s lives in the future (the smart one will know what I am talking about)\n",

He said \"Don't worry Barbie, I'm plastic so my member is always ready to party.\" Margot bit her lip and said \"Wow, thanks Ken.\" He then laughed at me and began to insert his meat rocket into Margot and Margot began laughing at me too. I tried to run away but Ryan grabbed me with his incredible muscles and and pulled me up against his stiff chest as he was clapping Margot's cheeks. With his other hand he started punching me in the balls which finally made my Johnson get stiff but at this point it was too late, I was already being dominated by him. I watched with shame and jealousy as Ryan abused my nether regions and gave his sweet seed to Stacy.\n",

Parts were emotional and relatable and quite touching actually, but the conclusion was pretty cold and felt flat. Barbie leaves ken in the dust. He's left to find himself, separately,  whilst Barbie \"lives her truth\" as a human. This movie could have been an opportunity to heal some wounds on today's social issues and confusion, but I felt it didn't because the male was left behind. After all, viewers will have sympathised with the males (ken)  identity crisis just as much as the females (Barbie) identity crisis. That's why I felt the movies message/sentiment was kinda lost. Now that Barbie's in the real world, there's only a certain amount of time until she is missing the male energy in her life 😂\n",

I get that this is a feminist movie and this political movement has its ulterior motives but I was hoping that at least this film would close gender gaps and gender discrimination. The movie seems to just be a marketing plot because the final message is that in  barbie world women have the power, isn't that sexist? (it feels like they want to further perpetuate gender power differences) Why in our world dolls have to be for girls in the first place?. Mattel wants to keep making toys for girls and toys for girls where in each of the worlds one gender is in power. shouldn't both worlds be inclusive?.  . In the real world by common sense and understanding men and women can hold any job position and can have any role they wish, that is what we should pursue.  Feminism is not the way.\n",

      "First, I'm a liberal progressive... and totally support women who actually want equality and understand what that means. That said, in the not too distant future this film will most likely be looked back upon with a whole lot of embarrassment.. by pretty much everyone, probably even Gerwig, if she isn't already. It is possibly the most juvenile film ever made. Really surprised and tbh, disappointed that this film is an idol for young women. I mean.. wow, what happened!?! \"Modern\" (meaning today's) feminism seems predicated in delusions and seems confused and a bit lost within itself. Men have brainwashed women? That message alone is profoundly insulting to ALL women. But no... it is actually modern feminism that has brainwashed them. It has brainwashed them into literally worshipping themselves as victims of 'society' (whatever in the world that means) and victims of many other things nearly none of which reflect the past 50 years of reality. And also brainwashed into 'suddenly' believing their own sexuality was something not at all in their own control, and that their sexuality is nothing more than a false construct created by and forced upon them by patriarchy, which does not even exist. Another insult to women everywhere. These messages are utterly absurd, so much so it's actually hard to even believe they are taken seriously. It also seems like they have been brainwashed into thinking that telling other grown women how to behave and think about their own self and the world around them is good and womanly, despite being something NO man would ever even consider doing to another man OR to a woman for that matter. And now, as this movie proves, more brainwashing from what is in actuality a very small number of young, modern day versions of feminists who, tragically, cannot decipher reality from social media-driven lies and nonsense, and who happen to be concentrated in english speaking media and entertainment. They also seem to have no idea whatsoever how older \"real\" feminists and most men truly view the new modern feminists, which is as childish, naive, petty, insanely entitled, somewhat delusional and entirely self-absorbed people. The messages in this film are false, shockingly juvenile and ridiculous -- and yet here we are celebrating all of this in the name of ... young women.\n",

In other words, if you wouldn't go see Spy Kids 5 you shouldn't bother going to see this. The opening was beautiful until they get to the \"real world\" which is just a kid's view of how adults operate things. After that it becomes a preachy bore (no matter your politics) and falls flat.

She would then find her joy in life, multiple times and she would not care for her child in the appropriate way. Because her ego is too big and important. Her ex. Would be annoyed by her;m, so he would behave stupidly. She is constantly trying to find satisfaction in material things and  in her carrier or from the love aspect. But this poor little women isn’t finding it. So the world is to blame! And especially the men. If she would have raised a boy. This boy, wouldn’t be raised a good men. So the vicious cycle is continuing. \n",

I understand about the barbie world is girls toy world...it is actually an escape dreamworld for girls.. but come on, women are not treated that bad in real world too... everyone has their own part, men and women should not compete they should be partner..its not easy to take mans part, and its not easy to take women part also... the things what i love about this movie is it reminds me of my childhood...i love to play barbies...i got 12 collection of barbies and ken...but the ideas of feminism and hierarchy in this movie is actually too much to add because actually women got so much specialty just like women's parking, women's health protection and etc ..women can speak-out about their depression and its okay, but man cannot because man should protect women, man have bigger responsibilities..they the one who build houses, the one who send to war and etc. If a wife do not have job and husband go to work no one will judge the wife but if a wife work and husband don't then people will condemn the husband, wife will complain about their husbands is useless ...most women work for their own benefit and will complain if she have to support man, but most man work for their women, children and family and they accept that as responsibility. I understand that nowadays women also take man's responsibility... but women always complain and demands for treatment..love the movie set, actors, cinematography, costumes, symbolism but not the feminism they insert in this movie... there is a scene that really touch my heart when this women express her dissatisfaction on real world...i am sure that most women feels those too, our world are not perfect, men and women have our struggles too...women leads the world doesn't solve the world problems\n",

      "One of the worst films I've ever seen, and I won't apologize for thinking this. The characters are card-board cutouts that are about as bland as can be, the plot manages to feel cliche and overdone while still being so bizarre and stupid, and the dialogue/script is just awful. Like, is an \"all the way to the top\" button on an elevator really considered comedy? It's so bad and that's not even taking into account the awful cram-down-your-throat messaging that is, and there's no argument otherwise, meant to divide men and women. There's no subtlety or nuance at all. The real world, which is a complex place, is treated with about as much complexity as the Barbie land is. It's essentially a second fantasyland in this movie. Then, it literally just swaps Barbie land from a society ruled by women to a society ruled by men, and instead of saying how too much of either way isn't really a good thing, it instead goes for a plot about the girls retaking their country (to make is exactly as it was before, which they pretend like wasn't a problem even though it was obviously so bad that Ken was super easily and quickly manipulated by \"the patriarchy\") by exploiting male stereotypes. Which yes, could be funny. Stereotypes are funny. But just not in the way it's used here, it just feels really bitter. Also, a twelve-year-old girl who obviously doesn't know what fascism is making Margot Robbie cry by screaming at her that she is a fascist might be the low point in human history we've ever hit. If everyone thought the way the filmmakers of Barbie obviously do, our society would crumble. There's so many better ways to say the things a Barbie movie should say. And yes, I know, \"Dur, why do you care so much it's literally a movie about dolls, dur, you spent all the time writing this comment, dur.\" First of all, don't pretend like this movie wasn't made literally just to be controversial. But yeah, it's because I love movies. I love good movies. And it sucks to see this flaming pile of absolute garbage get all this praise just for pretending to uplift women when you could watch an actual film that actually explores ideas and themes, and also actually empowers women. I've hated movies besides this one and have ranted about them just as much if not more than this one, so just because I took the time to write all this doesn't make Barbie special.\n",

Margot Robbie totally seemed like a doll come to life,  you could not have cast an actress who more personified Barbie, and Ryan Gosling was really, really good as Ken (although I'm biased he always plays his characters with a lot of emotion and feeling), and Kate McKinnon was honestly the surprise jewel, she was so wacky and weird and I loved her character.  Margot Robbie was both clueless about the dirty nasty real world as a plastic doll living in a perfect word but then super self aware and grows so much as a person (a doll? a human?) in the movie, and her character is suprisingly complex. I thought the aesthetics were incredible, the scenes really take your breath away, with so many vibrant colors.  The set design was pretty spectacular.  A lot of the jokes went over the head but the really basic ones (\"I'm gonna beach you off\") were so wacky and good.  It was funny, beautiful, and the musical and dance scenes were awesome.  I only wish there were more musical numbers.  It was wacky, silly, fast-paced, witty, sharp, funny, philosophical, existentialist, it really makes you question who you are and whether the world you are living in is real or not.\n",

It touched me on a personal deep emotional level. I went with a friend. And when we came out of the cinema my bf would join us for a drink. I took out my phone to text him which bar we would meet and directly two entitled men felt it was appropriate to say like: \"nowadays everyone has to walk around with a phone\". I was too flabbergasted to respond sadly enough. But I wish I could have just told him to mind their own business. They don't know why I grab my phone. They just judge. And that's the whole point of the movie. If we could just stop judging each other and lifting each other up, the world would be a much better place.\n",

Also, when have we ever seen a handicap or fat Barbie??? This movie cleverly reconfigured and disguised Barbie into a figure for women's rights when in fact like the company behind it, they are all insidious liars corrupting our minds together. Clever script, very preachy about women's struggles, full of existential angst = all from a sexualized toy that supports the very things it says it hates. Bizarre mashup.\n",

Is it really about how men are creating an actual patriarchy in this world and ruling the women and therefore women need to step up and belittle the men just so they can be on top? Or is all that just satire and really poking fun at the joke feminism is today and using that to instead promote the message that women and men need each other? Because if it’s the latter, count me in! And in that case, people on both sides must be taking this way too seriously. If it’s the former, there is no way in heck I’m watching it. The thing is, those are completely opposite messages. They cannot both be true. So which is it?? Either this movie is as woke as some say it is or it really is as deep and moving as others say it is. But what confuses me further is some who think it’s deeply moving proceed to say that the world we live in is indeed a patriarchy where it’s “impossible” to be a woman.

      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The upcoming Barbie movie has generated significant excitement among fans and moviegoers, promising a fun and inspirational film that celebrates empowerment, diversity, and imagination. However, recent news about rapper Nikki Minaj's involvement in the project has sparked controversy and raised concerns among certain audiences. In this article, we will explore the reasons why some feel Nikki Minaj's inclusion may not be the best fit for the Barbie movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image and Brand Alignment\n",
      "Barbie has been an iconic children's toy for generations, representing ideals of beauty, elegance, and grace. Her character symbolizes a positive role model, teaching young girls about self-expression and individuality. Nikki Minaj, on the other hand, is known for her provocative and sometimes controversial image, which includes explicit lyrics, bold fashion choices, and a hyper-sexualized persona. Critics argue that the stark contrast between Nikki Minaj's brand and Barbie's wholesome image may send conflicting messages to young viewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parental Concerns\n",
      "Given that the Barbie movie is primarily aimed at young audiences, parents play a crucial role in determining its appropriateness for their children. Some parents may feel uneasy about Nikki Minaj's presence in the movie due to her adult-oriented content and provocative public image. These concerns may lead parents to question the film's suitability for their impressionable children, potentially impacting the movie's overall success at the box office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Misalignment with the Movie's Message\n",
      "The Barbie movie is expected to deliver empowering messages about self-acceptance, resilience, and the importance of kindness. While Nikki Minaj is undoubtedly a successful and talented artist, her brand and lyrics have often been criticized for promoting materialism, vanity, and confrontational attitudes. Critics argue that her involvement in the film could divert the focus away from the movie's positive themes and risk sending mixed messages to young viewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missed Opportunities for Diverse Representation\n",
      "Diversity and inclusivity have become essential aspects of modern storytelling, with a growing demand for representation of various cultures and backgrounds in movies. Some critics argue that Nikki Minaj's casting may not be the most inclusive choice, as it perpetuates the stereotype of the sassy and outspoken Black woman. While it is crucial to celebrate diverse voices in film, some argue that the character should have been portrayed by an actress who aligns more closely with Barbie's uplifting and empowering image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The Barbie movie has the potential to become a heartwarming and impactful film for audiences worldwide. However, Nikki Minaj's involvement has sparked debate and concerns about the film's messaging and suitability for young viewers. While Nikki Minaj is undoubtedly a talented and successful artist, some argue that her image and brand may not align seamlessly with Barbie's empowering and inspiring character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pursuit of promoting diversity and inclusivity, it is vital for filmmakers to make thoughtful choices that do not undermine the core message of a beloved and iconic character like Barbie. As the film progresses, it remains to be seen how Nikki Minaj's role will be portrayed and how the film's overall impact will be received by audiences of all ages.\n",

I don't like that comparison or the comparison that Barbie is so detached from the real world. Other than the \"perfect\" figure Barbie has everything else about her is left up to your imagination as a child. And for girls Barbie could do anything that was literally her slogan we girls can do anything right  Barbie. So why are we taking that away from girls and dumbing Barbie down to a superficial party girl who's all about her wardrobe and possessions? And Ken being her best friend or boyfriend knows Barbie can be anything such as a doctor, astronauts, veterinarian, etc... so why is he acting like there can't be a female doctor in this movie? I don't understand the whole Barbie needs to get in touch with the real world theme, is it not real that a woman can do anything? Can we not be doctors, lawyers, president, etc...  I'm going to watch the movie before making my mind up about it but if it truly is how the trailer makes it appear I know I'm not going to be a fan, because my Barbie was always a strong independent woman and her having a great wardrobe and knowing how to have fun didn't take away from that. Her house and vehicle was thanks to her success of working hard.\n",

      "PROS: lots of actors and actresses who are household names and a handful of laugh out loud moments. The first 15-20 minutes were probably the best part of the film. \n",
      "\n",
      "CONS: the movie was clearly political and had an agenda of feminism and toxic masculinity.  In barbieland all the Ken’s are pathetic idiots and have no purpose in life. In the real world men are toxic and ruin everything.  The storyline was pretty vanilla and there was a point it felt like the movie dragged on. The film heavily relied on random actors popping in and out who were household names instead of actually keeping you entertained because the story was captivating. The plot was so basic you’d think the target audience were children, but half the jokes were targeted to adults to the point the 7 year old girl sitting behind me kept asking her mom “what does that mean mommy?”\n",

Bu Barbieler ve Ken rezalet...  Çok uyduruk ve baştan savma iş yapılmış. Komedi filmi ise sorun yok. Ama komedi filmi değilse bu aktrist ve aktörlerle tam bir rezalet. 1- Kadın Barbie olmak için yaşlı. 2-Barbie olmak için çirkin. 3- Barbie olmak için kısa boylu. 4- Vücut hatları Barbie gibi değil travesti gibi. Öbür Barbieler daha beter. Bildiğin çirkin kadınlar. Ellerindeki Barbielerle uzaktan yakından alakaları yok. Amerikalıların nedense böyle bir beceriksizliği var. Hiçbir karakteri benzetemiyorlar. Gargamel, Casper hiçbiri benzemiyordu. Biz filmlerimizde tıpatıp aynısını yapıyoruz makyajla. Zaten benzeyenini buluyoruz. Geri kalanını makyözler ve efektçiler hallediyor. Amerikan sineması koca bir balon. Fiyasko... Dünyada bir kaç tane kadın var. Esetik ameliyat ile kendini Barbie ye benzeten. Evet gerçekten de Barbie ye benziyorlar. Bir tane se Ken'e benzeyen var. Onlar filmde oynatılsa daha gerçekçi olurdu. Bu cast berbat. Asla izlemem. Bedava olsa bile izlemem. Çünkü hiçbir şekilde Barbie ye benzemiyorlar... Dediğim gibi, komedi olarak yapıldıysa izlenir belki ama başka türlü asla izlenmez. Bence daha yeni çıkmışken apar topar filmi piyasadan çekin, kimse izlemeden. Rezil olmayın... Barbie firması bu rezalete nasıl izin verdi. En azından Cast'ı kedileri seçme şartı koyabilirlerdi. Bu Barbie firmasının da prestijini sarsar çünkü. Onların ürettikleri oyuncaklar bu kadar alelade tipler değil. Söylediğim gibi o ameliyatla kendini Barbie ye çeviren kadınlar bu filme çok yakışırdı. Bu alelade tipler değil. Sonuç: Cast olarak Rezalet!!! 👎👎👎👎\n",
      " Başroldeki yaşlı kadının yüzündeki çizgileri yok etseydiniz bari. Hiç mi makyaj malzemeniz yoktu? Hiç mi bilgisayar efektiniz yoktu. Siyahi Barbie ise şaka gibi. Özellikle arayıp bu kadar çirkin bir kadın bulunmuş sanki. O siyahi Barbie bebeğe bakın benziyor mu? Paraya kıyıp Naomi Campbell, Rianna yı falan oynatabilirdiniz. Buradaki kadında en fazla afrika kabilesi reisinin karısını oynayacak tip var. Barbie yi değil. Üçüncü Barbie ye hiç girmiyorum bile. En facia olanı o. Sokakta yürüyen, kolundan tuttuğunuzu Barbie yapmışsınız. Ya da ciddi bir görme probleminoz var. Göz doktoruna gitmelisiniz... Çıkıp bir açıklama yapıp Barbie firmasından ( paralarını çarçur ettiğiniz, prestijlerini sarstığınız için), dünya insanlarından da onları aptal yerine koyduğunuz için özür dilemelisiniz\n",

Its kind of like going to hear a back up singer Taylor Swift concert, filled up with gurls all taking selfies and babbling the same noise. Funny thing, you great feminist don't keep the power on, don't build anything that takes real work, basically you do nothing but feed on the system playing the victim. But you are so easily played the agenda crowd can drain you of money so easy. I'm sure they managed to drag weak mangina men also, or a few of them. It does kind of reverse on them toward the end, people with brain cells might say it shows wahmen can only take over if men allow it. Which of course is totally true.

      "The movie had no depth, in my opinion. Its dialogue was pretty flat and even the intro line / hook up line was average (you could tell the movie was going to be average; Hollywood really needs to find good scriptwriters again, no joke). It didn't tell anything new and in my opinion, it had no conclusion at all. Or even a solid general idea, it was just all over the place. I also wished it would have stuck to just one genre / feeling : make it full comedy, or make it more emotional or something. But it was all over the place. I thought it would at least be witty, but it was not. I would rate it 6/10 and if I had the chance, I would not watch it again in a cinema. It is not cinema-level worthy (but it turns out 90% of Hollywood's movies are not cinema-worthy these days). Even the cinematography / picture was really average. It was commercial from beginning to end and the most entertaining parts were Ken' parts... in a movie about Barbie, it turns out Ken was the most entertaining one. That says a lot. The only other most notable scene was America Ferrera's speech, but even that one was just spitting out a list of already known-facts and in the most average way (again, nothing witty, original or artistic about the speech itself). Kids will probably like it... but even back in the days, movies for kids had subtle lines that only adults would understand, and yet there were so tastefully implemented in the movies. If I were to be a kid again and someone would make me choose between this Barbie movie and let's say... Toy Story, then Toy Story would win by a mile distance and in a heartbeat.\n",

      "Too bad the actual film was not this upbeat. They should've charged us $23 for this trailer, these are all the scenes we wanted anyway. I wasn't expecting the soapbox preaching on rights and standards because nowhere does it feature in this preview. Because I'm sure people wouldn't have gone to see this film if they had emphasized that material. I don't know many people who seek to pay money to be told how life is full of struggle and double-standards. I can live that misery for free, thanks. I left the theater feeling down on myself and society in general. The whole tone was sour, sarcastic, and a real bummer overall. And as trailers are good at doing, the brief allusion to the Barbie Girl song dominates this trailer like it's a prominent feature in the actual film. In reality, it's at the very end credits and more like this soft background melody to the overlaid song (which I wasn't a fan of). And if you think I got the wrong take on this movie, go to the part where the white-presenting father is ACTIVELY trying to learn his wife and biracial daughter's language, and how they shoot him down and mock his efforts. So much for fairness and consideration of others! The tone of this movie was rules are for thee and not for me, or I guess \"rules are for men because women have been put down for so long that it's fine if we're impatient or nasty because, well, we struggled for so long so it's our time to have power, and politeness is fluff anyway\". You watch this trailer thinking the energy is one way, and then you walk out of the theater realizing it was a complete veneer over heaps of negativity. There was no inspiration, no hope that it'll get better, just constant reminders of how awful and tough it is to be a woman...what?? Why did I pay actual money to hear all that? I really wish I'd never seen this film.\n",

I recognized three people in the movie, Micheal Cera, America Ferrara and Will Farrel. I felt bad for Ken because he felt neglected by Barbie because she had everything and he didn't. I loved Micheal Cera as a kid in Berenstein Bears as Brother Bear. Which doll or human did Micheal play? I totally recommend seeing this movie, 100/100 for me. Also, I felt bad for Barbie because she had so many things in her life that she didn't want to give up at first, then she didn't want to be just Barbie anymore 😢.

      "The movie begins with Barbie land, a matriarchal society where women are self confident, self sufficient and successful while the Ken (Men) counterparts spend the days doing recreational activities at the beach. The Barbies hold all the job positions such as doctors, lawyers and politicians. That is the opening premise. Later on, Barbie and Ken went to the real world and they found out that it’s a very misogynistic place. Ken brings the patriarchy to Barbie land and the Kens took over and became rulers in Barbie world. The Barbies want to turn Barbie world back into a matriarchal society and they used the power of feminism to stop the Kens and turn their world back to what it was before.\n",

      "Here’s how to fix it: Barbie and Ken went to the real world and found out it’s a very misogynistic place. Barbie and Ken realized that Barbie world has the same problem (It’s a very misandric place (In other words the two worlds both have sexism in them)) and they both agreed to work together to stop misogyny and misandry in both worlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "There. I fixed it. That is what the movie’s story should’ve been, unfortunately that’s not what we got. Instead, it’s yet another “men bad women good” movie by woke Hollywood where the men are portrayed as dumb, weak and evil while the women are portrayed as smart, strong and good in comparison (Remember Last Jedi, SheHulk and Ghostbusters 2016?). In conclusion, this movie is a disappointing dumpster fire and I hope it fails. Critical Drinker is right about this dumpster fire.\n",

      "A really big issue is that every single female in this movie is good and every male is bad. Maybe Alan is a good guy, but he’s barely a character. ALL of the men we see are incompetent and ALL of the women are wonderful. Even when the Barbies realize that the Kens need to feel they have a right to exist, the Kens are still portrayed as idiots. It could’ve been a really interesting examination of inequality, but I guess the creators thought misandry would be better.\n",

      "Im a huge movie fan. I will watch just about any movie that comes out in the theater. I do do any research in advance as I do not want to go into the movie biased and influenced by other peoples opinions. But I just watched this movie today. It literally was one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. Like most people I go to the theater to have fun, have a different experience then watching at home and to be entertained. This movie was nothing more then a 4th wave feminist filled, men hating propaganda spewing piece of trash. And the worst part is it does nothing but put a divide between men and women. At first Ken loves Barbie and she doesnt like him and acts like she doesnt need him or want him. Then Ken turns into an extreme idiot and they writers makes him hate her, which in turn makes her hate him even more. And the worst part is there is no happy ending where they end up together. She still rejects him in the end. If this world would stop putting men and women against each other and start focusing on the differences that we have that makes us compatible for each other then this world would be a better place, more peaceful, happier place. Instead the movie does nothing but destroy men, promote extreme feminism and send a ton of wrong messages and mindsets to young people in our society. I could say plenty more about how bad this movies was but I will simply say this. Its one of the worst movies ive ever seen and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone and most definitely not for any children or young people to see.\n",

      "So many things when I think about Barbie. I was born in 1993 and growing up I remember the issues that people had with Barbie dolls because it was always coming out on the news. It was either too sexual and it was playing with childrens minds by thinking am i going to look just like Barbie when I grow up. It was also a way of giving the children an open mind on who they were going to be and then the ads and commercials were on point when it came to that. Then the bratz came in and it was the same issues because it was more sexual due to the fashion and clothes that they wore but they were also looked upon as unacceptable due to the fact that they made bratz dolls based on different skin tones and hair and the skin tone represented a different race because a Hispanic can pass by as maybe a French due to the skin tone. 1969 was when ken came in. The first Barbie doll was actually a blond and brunette but it looked more like a reddish hair color. In the 80s was when they finally had a Latina barbie doll, but either way Barbie is always looked as a blonde and light skin. If they wanted they could use a different color Barbie in the movie or whatever in general. I mean they do have a Barbie who isn’t blonde talking about racism with ken sitting next to her in the Barbie cartoons\n",

Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.\n",

I wish they'd gone with new actors to play Ken and Barbie, as all I see so far is Harley Quinn and the guy who dated a mannequin, but, of course, I never played with either one; my friends and I were too busy blowing up army men and GI Joes with firecrackers like they were in real battle.

And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Cat dancing has changed my life for the better.

      "\n",
      "You ever heard of “Hoof and Mouth Disease”? Around 1924 in Southern California, they had an outbreak. They had to slaughter over 100,000 animals. Devastated the whole area. A lot of people lost their jobs. See, they didn’t catch the sick cow in time, so the disease spread. You got to fight the disease before it spreads. Before it gets out of hand. It’s been going on, with Disney’s Mulan and Cruella, and it ain’t happening again. Not under my watch. Creating more mature movies based on children’s toys or media is gotta stop. If this doesn’t stop, movies like that could go R-rated, and that would be a big disaster. Not just for kids, but for your company as well. You’ve done it with Velma, too. With a TV-MA rating. I hope Barbie flops big time, and it better teach you an important lesson. You see, I’ve been thinking, we’re gonna have to re-write the MPA’s Rating System, to better suit the current environment. These PG-13 movies based on children’s products or media have got to be reconsidered for their rating. And it better happen by next year.\n",

Not only does he do a TERRIFIC job capturing the himbo essence of Ken, but he also matches perfectly with Margot's vibe. And to anyone saying he looks \"too old\" to play Ken... every single actor playing someone in the Barbie World looks to be around the same age as he does. You can clearly tell these aren't teens or 20 year olds, so if they had gotten someone younger to play Ken, he would've been the one looking out of place. And either way, isn't everyone preaching about \"casting the most talented actor\" instead of someone else for a specific reason (in this case, age)? I don't know who else must've auditioned for Ken, and you can dislike the theme of the movies Ryan Gosling has acted in, but you can't tell me that isn't an amazing actor.\n",

      "I say that Barbie was actually \"progressive\" because 50 or so years ago, she was dismissed by some feminists of the day since she had unrealistic physical measurements.  But she wasn't a housewife (or a wife), she wasn't a secretary, she wasn't a waitress, and she doesn't have kids.  She's a doctor, an astronaut, a marine biologist, an airline pilot.  Granted, one in high heels with a wasp waist.  But remember, anorexia nervosa and bulimia were not household words back then, let alone fears spread to every tween on their handheld ADHD device of choice.\n",

      "Another YouTuber, Beau of the Fifth Column, countered some critics who thought the new Snake Eyes (from G.I. Joe) was too woke because he was portrayed by an Asian actor (with the very Asian name of Henry Golding).  Honestly I always assumed he was Asian because he looks like a ninja from a 1980s action movie.  But in any case, Beau mentioned that even in the comic books from the 1980s, G.I. Joe introduced military characters who were: women, veterans suffering from PTSD, liberal politicians who don't behave in a tropey manner, even a pacifist.  So, they were always \"woke.\"  Or progressive, whatever you want to call it, even back when they were dismissed as a craven recruitment toy.\n",

Then again, I'm a skeptic when it comes to \"unneeded\" remakes. Prolly gonna pass this one, but hope everyone who sees it enjoys it in all the nostalgia 🥰\n",

      "Everything Greta Gerwig seems to do has a euphoric, nostalgic, ephemeral vibe to it. And although each stylistically different, that puts her in contention with other great stylized directors such as Sofia Coppola and Wes Anderson. Now with Barbie we can expect a sincerity and humanity, like any of Gerwigs previous films, but this film will have an extra sparkle. So with the stylistic choices made for the sake of the theme of Barbie, one should wonder if this film in any way will be an indicator of Gerwigs stylization. After all, there is an alleged rule in the industry that states a directors style is usually beginning to show and then stick by the directors third movie. This will be Greta Gerwigs fourth film as a director. So what should we expect to see her bring from films like “Little Women” and “Lady Bird”? Very excited for this!\n",

After the CCP began to suppress Falun Gong in 1999, the persecution became the largest campaign in China since the Cultural Revolution. \n",
      "\n",
      "“In 2001, with approximately two million Falun Gong [practitioners] in the Chinese [labor camp] system, Falun Gong prisoners are singled out for retail organs only examinations... kidneys, liver, heart, and to some extent the lungs, ...” explained Gutmann in his presentation. “By 2002, the wait time for foreign organ tourists are reported to be two weeks or less.” \n",
      "\n",
      "By 2003, detained Tibetans and Christians were also examined for their organs. In 2014, police officers in China went to Falun Gong practitioners’ homes to take blood and DNA samples compatible with tissue typing. After 2016, the CCP also ordered blood sampling from Uyghurs for DNA and tissue matching. That is, the CCP has expanded organ harvesting from executed prisoners to detained Falun Gong practitioners, to Tibetans, Christians, and Uyghurs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation announced a policy of refusing research articles from mainland China due to the transplant abuse. Gutmann referred to it as a courageous move. Furthermore, he proposed that research articles from Chinese doctors or nurses involving organ harvesting not appear in Western medical journals. In addition, they should be banned from medical conferences and scientific collaborations. Related medical device sales should also be stopped, he added.\n",

Proving highly adaptable, it entered service with the Navy in 1961 before it was adopted by the United States Marine Corps and the United States Air Force, and by the mid-1960s it had become a major part of their air arms. Phantom production ran from 1958 to 1981 with a total of 5,195 aircraft built, making it the most produced American supersonic military aircraft in history, and cementing its position as a signature combat aircraft of the Cold War.\n",

I added it to my own Letterboxd! What was I thinking? She'll never change. She'll never change! Ever since she started directing, always the same! Even made mumblecore interesting! But not our Greta!
