      "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

      "Before making Barbie (2023),Greta Gerwigsingle-handedly directed two films:Lady Bird (2017)andLittle Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played byMargot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows isThe Wizard of Oz (1939)journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofThe Truman Show (1998)orStranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\n",

      "The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\n",

      "As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\n",

      "As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n",

      "It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.\n",

      "I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\n",

      "I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.\n",

      "The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\n",

      "I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.\n",

      "While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice \"Barbie World\" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n",

      "I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

      "Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\n",

      "I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?\n",

The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down.

The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing.

I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity.

That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon.

      "I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\n",

She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\n",

      "I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.\n",

      "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

      "Before making Barbie (2023),Greta Gerwigsingle-handedly directed two films:Lady Bird (2017)andLittle Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played byMargot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows isThe Wizard of Oz (1939)journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofThe Truman Show (1998)orStranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\n",

      "The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\n",

      "As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\n",

      "As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n",

      "It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.\n",

      "I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\n",

Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men.

The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\n",

      "I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.\n",

      "While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice \"Barbie World\" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n",

The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again.

      "I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?\n",

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down.

The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman.

It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on.

I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\n",

      "My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\n",

      "I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.\n",

      "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

      "Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\n",

      "The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\n",

      "As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\n",

      "As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n",

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.\n",

      "I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\n",

      "I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.\n",

The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\n",

      "I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.\n",

      "8.5/10 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice \"Barbie World\" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n",

      "I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.\n",

      "Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\n",

      "I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?\n",

      "I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.\n",

      "This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!\n",

      "Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\n",

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing.

      "Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\n",

Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.\n",

      "I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\n",

      "My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\n",

      "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

      "Before making Barbie (2023),Greta Gerwigsingle-handedly directed two films:Lady Bird (2017)andLittle Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played byMargot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows isThe Wizard of Oz (1939)journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofThe Truman Show (1998)orStranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\n",

      "The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\n",

Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\n",

      "As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n",

It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\n",

I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it.

BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.\n",

      "While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice \"Barbie World\" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish \"What Was I Made For?\" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n",

      "I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie.\n",

      "Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\n",

      "I walked out of the theatre thinking, \"Yeah, I had a good time in that movie\". But as the day went on I kind had that \"Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.\"The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?\n",

      "I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.\n",

      "This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!\n",

At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst. How many ways can I say do not go see it if you have a choice. See anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated self-importance.

      "Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\n",

      "The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.\n",

      "Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\n",

      "This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from \"Barbieland\" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.\n",

      "I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\n",

      "My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\n",

It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast.

      "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

      "Before making Barbie (2023),Greta Gerwigsingle-handedly directed two films:Lady Bird (2017)andLittle Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played byMargot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows isThe Wizard of Oz (1939)journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofThe Truman Show (1998)orStranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.\n",

      "The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!\n",

      "As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are \"brainwashed\" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.\n",

      "I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\n",

      "I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.\n",

      "The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.\n",

      "I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term \"Marvel speak.\" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: \"You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!\"The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.\n",

      "I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!\n",

      "Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\n",

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.\n",

I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).\n",

      "This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from \"Barbieland\" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon.

      "I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..\n",

      "My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.\n",

The movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene, I also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality. It's done for jokes though so I know it's not meant to be an actual message with the humour, I just think it weakens the messaging of the film, it's still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall it's a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao, I personally didn't find it to funny but I still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling.\n",

      "My Rating 6.5/10I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I\n",
      "just didn't get it ?Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying \"that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences \"the thing you didn't know you wanted.I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named \"Techni-Barbie,\" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,\n",

      "I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was \"Sanctimonious Barbie.\"\n",

Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the \"conflict\" part of the writing. It was just too much!

      "I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\n",

I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, \"Why can't Barbie just sing a song?!\" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis.

      "Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.\n",

      "The film opens strongly with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering compelling performances. Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone. This approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with Greta Gerwig.The production design of Barbie Land is visually captivating, offering a feast for the eyes. The music soundtrack, featuring a standout disco track by Dua Lipa, complements the film well. Dua Lipa's cameo as Mermaid Barbie is a highlight.The film incorporates satire and self-aware humor, which adds depth to the story. However, the humor doesn't consistently land, and some moments feel forced. The character Stereotypical Ken provides sporadic moments of humor.In summary, 'Barbie' is a film worth watching at least once. It includes an empowerment monologue delivered by America Ferrera's character, addressing societal expectations placed on women. While there is still some double standard in gender role expectations, it is less prominent in today's society compared to the past.\n",

It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I'm not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just \"ok\". Just that.Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias.\n",

      "They really did some fantastic marketing with this movie.It's not exactly bad. It's just mediocre. It's very pretty to look at, and some of the music is actually quite funny and fitting.But this is nowhere near what was advertised, it's not a fun jokey movie that brought homage to old movies, some saterical jokes etc. It's that, followed by story with heaaaavy messaging, followed again by a quick joke.However none of it is funny or interesting enough to justify its runtime. The ending in particular was very obvious and just kept going, it's so clear they want you to feel something but you don't. It's just not interesting enough with the story they out forth and how long the \"ending\" goes on for.\n",

      "I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in.\n",

But Sometimes, in Life 😂, You Just Have to Go With It.Hashtag NUMBER 1 Lesson You Should Take From this Film: Build, Hone, Grow, and then Come Together and Become KENOUGH! (Both Guys and Girls)Greta Gerwig Nailed this Thing!I was just sitting Their Watching it and I was like \"Man, I'm Actually Enjoying what the hell is going on here\" 🤣Things I Liked About The Film -1. Firstly, the Plotline and More Importantly, the Execution of this Plotline is Great imo. It's Interesting and Kept me Engaged from Point to Point. It hits the points it needs to hit with it's Comedic Tone and Some Serious Moments too. The Balance is Laced in and Out of the Film and is just about PERFECT. (Again, People are Going to have Problems with Certain Things)2. Secondly, the Aesthetics are so Good. It is Such a Unique Watch. You Won't See Anything Like It. What a Watch! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!3. The Tone 🏩 and the Way much of the Dialogue is Delivered is Fitting For this Film.4. The Cinematography and Some of the Shots at Times are So Good. It's Gorgeous.5. Margot Robbie Literally Perfects This Role as Barbie. Her Acting, Her Tone, Her Look. 🌸 Not to Mention Some of her Costuming (Pink Cowboy Outfit) 🤠 makes Her Look Out of This World.6. Ryan Gosling Nails it. He was Absolutely Hilarious at Times (Especially in the 3RD Act)7. Much of the Comedy Landed for me (Comedy is Subjective, so also, Some Didn't) and from what I Heard, it Landed for a Lot of the Audience I was with. (Beached off Wasn't Funny, but after That, The Laughs Started Coming in). (4th Wall Ugly Joke, Margot Is the Wrong Example for this, was the Biggest Laugh in the theatre 😆)8. So to Summarise, I Really Liked the Beach Battle, The Dance Scenes, the Plotline, The Comedy, the Tone, The Aesthetics and the Atmosphere in that Theatre whilst Watching this Thing.From what I watched, it was Well Put Together, Well Excecuted and everything Came Together So Well. And that Cherry on Top Quip 🍒🎂 from Margot Robbie was Just 👌Overall, if You have Problems with the Some of the Messaging, You will Not Enjoy it, Bottom Line. (Guys, You don't have to agree or Take any of the Messaging to Heart, just go with it, Become Kenough and Extract that Entertainment Factor For Your Own Enjoyment) (Ladies, Take Some of the Positive Messages From this Film because there are Some Genuinely Positive Messages in Here)\n",

      "BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models.

      "This is an odd movie. On the one hand the presentation of the Barbie world... and Mattel making fun of itself... is fantastic.But on the theme / plot / moral of the story side, all I came up with is a big \"What?\". The Barbies are initially presented as real life dolls who all have vital roles in society, but in reality are scripted airheads who live the same life every day. The Kens are presented as bumbling fools who live only to grovel at the feet of the Barbies. Which is kind of how the toys really are, I guess. I can get the satire.But then we get further into the movie, and the Kens become pompous overlords and the Barbies mysteriously, for no reason whatsoever, turn into Ken-worshippers without a real purpose of their own.Somehow this is all supposed to represent masculine vs feminine roles in real life, but in truth don't accurately represent either. The movie presents a real world in which all men are successful and in charge and all women are subjected and repressed. While that does exist, are there no female doctors, attorneys, real estate moguls, business owners, etc etc?The movie presents this as extremes, and doesn't really do a very good job of it. About 2/3 of the way through, I can't tell whether the movie is against sexism or promoting it. The roles of the sexes become clouded... and like so many feminist movies we've seen, men are presented as idiots and women revert Barbie World right back to its female-dominated status.As a result although semi-brilliant in presentation, the movie is preachy, heavy-handed, bigoted, and loses the element of believe-ability and relevance. I had been told the movie is great... but because of the questionable script it's just so so.I enjoyed it, but in the end wondered exactly what the movie was trying to say? And in the end, the Barbie doll joins the real world? What's that all about? Perhaps they had some hidden meaning there, but I'm not sure exactly what it was.I give it 6 stars (better than mediocre) because of the sets, presentation and often enjoyable script lines, but there's a lot of head-scratching when it comes to the point this movie was actually trying to make... if any.\n",

      "I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.\n",

      "The movie isn't as fantastic as it was hyped to be. Its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected. Instead, it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of \"girls can do anything\" and \"find yourself.\" The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women's appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all. In my view, it's essentially a reiteration of the same old themes, just presented in updated ways. However, considering Hollywood's consistent conservatism and focus on profits, I appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the world's most profit-driven film industry.\n",

I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.\n",

      "It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don't know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either \"Im just Ken\" or \"What was I made for?\" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don't think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this \"chase scene\" didnt add much. Also, Gloria's (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn't exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.Overall, I would definitely recommend the film. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll have fun. This isn't just a movie, it is the moment.\n",

      "Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\n",
      "I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.\n",

      "SCORE: 9.5/10Queue the \"Perhaps I treated you too harshly\". I've seen this movie 6 times now. That is not a mistake and it did not happen on accident. I love this movie and, yes, it's not perfect, but it is way better than I had originally scored it and continued to score it each time I rewatched it. I think on my first watch I just couldn't get over how much of the film I had already seen from the marketing. There was an overwhelming amount of the movie revealed in things leading up to the release. The story is still lacking in some areas, but this genuinely might be the most entertaining movie of all time. The music is mesmerizing, the acting performances are unbelievable, and I never want to stop rewatching it.Also, I like to pick out new things each time I rewatch it. No one is talking about Hockey Barbie. She might have been my favorite. She is drop dead gorgeous.ORIGINAL SCORE: 7.8/10Letterboxd continues to be goated. The pink heart is a nice touch. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but could you blame me? The marketing for this movie was undoubtedly some of the best that has ever been done. The film wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there definitely was a feeling of being underwhelmed, which has to do with a lot of things. First, because the marketing was so amazing, it felt like I had seen 75% of the movie already before stepping foot in the theater. The story is good, but I think it really struggled with straddling the line between being a social commentary and being goofy and funny. It did a decent job of both, but each side hindered the ability for the other to have maximum impact. Because of that, it led to a lot of parts feeling forced, almost in an attempt to balance out the levels at very inopportune times. The timing was slightly off and created a couple awkward stretches where you were waiting for something to be funny, but it ended up being serious for a bit too long.With all that said, I still have a fun time with the premiere, and I'm not going to let knowing of all the good parts take away from how good they actually were. The songs were catchy, the vibes were superb, and the cast was amazing. Michael Cera as Allan and his involvement in the story was definitely a nice surprise. However, to no surprise, the stars of the show, me and Margot Robbie...I mean Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie killed it as Ken and Barbie. As a man, I thought the jabs at men were hilarious and warranted. The best type of comedy is relatable comedy, and I think they did a good job with it. The references to other movies were also cool, especially their dig at Zack Snyder's Justice League. The Film Bros are going to HATE this movie. The set pieces for this film were very impressive, and Greta Gerwig seems like an amazing human being.My criticisms of this movie are not to be taken as me being disappointed or even that I didn't like parts of it. I think I just saw the potential this movie had and it flashed it to us occasionally, but ultimately fell short. I am happy to be living in a time where Barbenheimer is happening and we can celebrate cinema together, but I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to blow this thing out of the water, no pun intended. If you look at my Perfect Score Ranking, you will see that I am not shy to express my more \"feminine\" side and appreciate movies that maybe most men wouldn't. I was really expecting for this film to be a huge hit for me, but it ended up just being good. Which is okay! I definitely still recommend for people to see it, and I will be jamming to the songs of the soundtrack in my car. Well done Greta and team!\n",

      "Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.\n",

The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others.

The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.\n",

      "Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.And what we have is a combination of The Twilight Zone and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It really focuses in on one Barbie (Margot Robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. Though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.And its messages pack a wallop!!!The casting is top notch, starting with Ms. Robbie in the title role. Ryan Gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. But one actress truly deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and that is America Ferrara. The other performers are likewise great!I'm also struck by how Mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. And toward the end, we have the Barbie doll's creator, Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) tell Ms. Robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. That scene alone is incredibly powerful.And of course, the visuals are something to behold!On the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality! Highly recommended!\n",

      "Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.\n",

      "The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.There could have been so many better turns than the one they took:Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girlBarbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to beInstead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes. I don't get why they went with that. The Barbie movie could have ended with equality.\n",

      "Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Truman Show\"; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. \"Barbie\" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms \"Barbie\" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast \"Real Time\" in which he said: \"Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment\". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the \"Stereotyped\" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory \"diversity and inclusion\" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be \"empowering\" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the \"evil patriarchy\". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the \"toxic\" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile \"conservative fascist\". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the \"evil businessmen\" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are \"d*mb\". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).\"Barbie\" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.\"Barbie\" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. \"Who is Barbie?\"\n",

      "I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.\n",

      "The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. \"Stereotypical\" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls \"wanted to be\"; she named \"Barbie\" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable \"stereotypical\" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (\"Pink\" by Lizzo, \"Dance the Night\" by Dua Lipa) (the original \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!\n",

      "I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.\n",

      "The casting for the roles is pretty well spot on. Margot Robbie is an absolute superstar and nobody would fit the role of Barbie better. I liked the little joke when Barbie says \"I'm not pretty anymore. I'm not 'stereotypical Barbie' pretty and the narrator replies \" Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point.\" Even when they try to make Margot Robbie less pretty they can't really achieve it. Robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception. Not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as well.They also found perfect roles for Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell. The roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie. The costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with Barbie's before.The movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldn't ever really decide what it was. This led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you aren't sure whether it's going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send. The problem is especially clear when the two blurred together. I wasn't sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a joke.The ending made it all even more confusing. I don't mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went down.Overall I would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy , but I suppose the filmmakers knew best since they're the ones raking in the cash right now. Kudos to them. Great Casting but is it Satire or Social Commentary?\n",

      "I'm not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig's best film but also the year's greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there's Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken's also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America's patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling's 80s ballad called I'm Just Ken and Billie Ellish's emotional song at the end of the movie, \"What was I made for?\".The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she's goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She's been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!! Margot Robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in Barbie, which is the best performance of her whole career!!! Go Margot Robbie!!!!!This movie is definitely worth watching!!!!!! I want to watch it again!!!!!!\n",

      "Honestly I really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular. Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\n",

      "My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible.\n",

This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.Side note: Greta Gerwig must be a fan of Sex Education - three actors end up here.\n",

      "This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.\n",

Some of the narrator quirks delivered by Helen Mirren are just perfect and I found myself laughing more than anything else.There are so many nuanced things that make the movie so sweet but the best is probably the nod to the original creator of Barbie and the reason the doll was produced to start.\n",

The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\n",

Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.\n",

      "POSITIVES:1) Ryan Gosling completely steals the film for me. He's hilarious, but also completely sells the emotional moments too. A great performance 2) The film had several moments that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the humour is very clever, as can be expected from these two great writers. I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective OscarsNEGATIVES:1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent.\n",

      "This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as \"preachy\" or \"agenda-driven,\" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!\n",

      "It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.The narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood, but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush women's self-esteem.The movie is entertaining , it makes you laugh, has so many characters, you barely get to appreciate all of them. I don't particularly love gosling as ken, I find him too old for the role, but plays well the part.Now the important thing about the movie is the concept. The whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant. It is light enough so you don't get an existencial crisis while watching it, but you'll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problem.That scene with the old lady is endearing, the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener, and ohh, that final joke! Bonus points for that ending!Will definitely what again.\n",

      "The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6/10. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.\n",

      "Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

      "I found the movie to be refreshing, but it's far from perfect.Ryan Gosling's performance was the best thing about the movie. His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn't the problem. It's just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn't go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn't even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song \"I'm just Ken\" should be nominated for the academy's \"Best Original Song\" award. It's just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.The story overall could have been better.\n",

      ": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\n",

      "The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a \"woke\" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!\n",

I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not \"Blame Mattel\" lol.

      "Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways.

      "It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\n",

      "In Greta's \"Barbie,\" the iconic doll takes on real-world problems in this comedy-meets-existential film, transforming from a seemingly superficial figure to a multi-dimensional character. Through physical and emotional challenges, Barbie discovers the true strength that comes from within, while the movie skillfully balances humor with deeper existential questions. As her journey unfolds, Barbie's exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema. The film's portrayal of Barbie's evolution from a controversial symbol to a beacon of empowerment becomes a captivating exploration of womanhood and the enduring spirit of femininity.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig's live-action Barbie is a surprisingly entertaining and funny film that will appeal to both kids and adults.The film is full of jokes and laugh-out-loud moments, and Ryan Gosling is a scene-stealer as Ken. He has eight abs, of course, but he also gives a surprisingly good performance. The film has a positive message about self-acceptance. Barbie learns that she doesn't have to be perfect to be loved and accepted.The film does have some flaws. The plot is a bit predictable, and the film could have been a bit shorter. However, the flaws are minor, and Barbie is ultimately a lot of fun. It's a great film for kids and adults alike, and it's sure to be a hit with fans of the iconic doll.\n",

      "Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.\n",

      "A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.\n",

      "Barbie, the iconic doll that has been a beloved part of countless childhoods for generations, has finally made her way to the big screen in the 2023 movie adaptation aptly titled \"Barbie.\"On the flip side, the film's attempts at humor often fell flat. The jokes and gags felt forced, and some of the comedic moments were cringe-worthy. It seemed as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to make Barbie relevant to a modern audience, resulting in a lack of authenticity in the humor.Barbie left me somewhat disappointed. While it showcased catchy songs, the storyline felt clichéd, lacking depth. Margot Robbie's work for Barbie was commendable, but the overall plot failed to engage adults.

I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented.

Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for.

I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom.

Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better.

When she decides to go to the \"real world,\" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. We also learn that many girls resent Barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. Then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the Barbie world and treating the women poorly. So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. It gets very muddled and isn't much fun at this point. I thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.\n",

She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it.

      "First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.Unfortunately there isn't much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That's it, that's all.The story revolves around the word \"patriarchy\" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What's left is the empty feeling of lost potential.The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn't perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this \"perfect\" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there's the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you're lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting.\n",

But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not.

It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)*The list of gorlz is ever growing and may only be influenced by my opinion.\n",

      "I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes & Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream.\n",

      "The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is \"You can be anything.\" That in the point of the movie. You can be anything.\n",

      "I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.Watching these light fluffy cute reviews, I know most people missed it.First of all, Barbie was very empowering in her own world where she could be anything she wanted and looking her best while doing it AND the men were not needed, NOT IN CHARGE and all The Ken's cared about was whether or not, they received any attention from their Barbie\n",
      "Sound familiar kept wives? Trophy Wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. That was Ken.The second she went into the real world. She was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. The complete opposite of Barbieland.I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.\n",

      "I saw the trailer and knew it would be a pretty fun movie to watch. It was so over the top with just everything (colours, world of women, world of men, horses and lectures) that in the end, all what matters was I laughed tears watching it. And so did everybody in the cinema I went to. The beach fight, Ken's obsession with horses and Will Ferrell on rollerblades.. it can't get better than that. The only issue for me was the end, when Barbie decides to go to the real world. That scene was a bit long.If you like sarcasm, satire and Will Ferrell, go and watch! You will have a colourfull two hours.\n",

      "As I watched Barbie the Movie, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The vibrant pink color that permeated the film brought back memories of my childhood, when everything seemed so vibrant and full of life.What struck me most about the movie was that it wasn't a typical superhero genre movie, which is so common in today's movie industry. Instead, it was a live-action non-comic book movie that was a breath of fresh air.The movie sets were stunning, with wild and imaginative backgrounds that were so fun to see on a beach. The foreground was equally as enjoyable, with standees that added a touch of whimsy to the film.As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel like a kid again. The childhood thoughts and memories that flooded my mind made me feel like I was back in time, experiencing the joy and wonder of childhood all over again.Overall, Barbie the Movie was a pleasure to watch. The imagination and creativity that went into the scene and set construction were seamlessly free-flowing throughout the film. The shocking colors and playful designs were a delight to see and made for an unforgettable movie experience.......\n",

      "I went and watched Barbie with my younger brother, and we both had lots of fun throughout the entire movie, even durkng the more emotional parts. The outfits, music, sets, characters, and everything are super colorful and interesting.It does cover some topics such as the patriarchy, but in silly and goofy way, such as Ken thinking the patriarchy had to do with horses. I didn't find the movie all that political, since they did cover those topics in a way that people would still be having fun while the movie was talking about them. The acting was amazing, so was the choreography during the songs (which were also really fun), while also having a nice message at the end.It's fun for everyone (my 10-year-old brother who has no interest in dolls says he'd give it a 9.5/10), and I definetly reccomend you go watch it!!\n",

      "Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.Will she go back to BarbieLand or stay in the real world. Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman. Its a very silly yet stupid film but it's definetly a good movie.\n",

      "There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.\n",

I knew the style of the movie by the scenes I'd seen leaked online I think that in itself is not everyone's style but boy it's unique and very barbieland. A lot of thought went into this and it's not just for women it's for anybody. We all need an Allan in our life. I could've used more boardroom ceo scenes with will farrel and his men tho. It's lovely to see the perspective of both men and women and at the end of the day what I got from this movie is about how we're each wanting to find our happiness and who we are outside of someone else.\n",

      "The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that \"it hates men\", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie's credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.There's the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.Then there's the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.Then there's the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie's deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn't quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn't need in the first place.Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.As a comedy movie, you can't aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie's comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. It doesn't seem to work.\n",

      "I identify as both Barbie and Ken... This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and it even made me cry. This film is such a raw, yet humorous look at how hard life is, as well as gender and everything that falls under that... From how the patriarchy hurts both men and women, how hard it is to live and not be exceptional, and the ideas at play in life. I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous. The soundtrack is also an amazing piece here. I've seen this film twice, and it has truly affected my life... Incredible.\n",

I really don't know how they did it, but near the end of the movie some scenes were the peak of cinema and some were just uninteresting.They aren't subtle with the politics, the political stuff is very preachy, but my biggest complain about the political stuff is that the movie is not entertaining when they bring it up.I expected a funny quirky movie, but I got to learn about political stuff, which wasn't that good. However, the movie is good when they don't talk about it.\n",

      "This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.\n",

      "The Barbie movie left me with a deep sense of disappointment in my cinematic journey. From my perspective, the film failed to captivate and provide an entertaining experience, and its storyline appeared to lack depth and substance. Regrettably, it seemed to target a younger demographic, leaving little to engage more mature viewers.In agreement with my sentiments, my mother shared a similar disinterest in the movie, finding it more irksome than enjoyable. The overwhelming acclaim and popularity of Barbie remain a puzzling enigma to me, as I perceive the film as overrated and lacking the qualities that should warrant such fervent admiration.\n",

The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!!

Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of \"manly\".

The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different.

      "I went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because, come on, who is more perfectly beautiful to portray Barbie than Margot Robbie? And who's more attractive to be Ken other than Ryan Gosling?This movie was too long, too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children. Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae. Despite its flaws, I'm glad I followed the hype and saw this movie. But I doubt I could sit through it again, it's just too silly and canned preachy.\n",

      "This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.\n",

      "This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song \"You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,\" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything.

      "The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.However, the opening scene is great (if you know the reference, of course), and there are some funny moments. But they seem to go against the general idea rather than to support it.\n",

      "I saw this movie a month ago and I've had a hard time gathering my thoughts for a review. I think that I need to give it another watch. That being said, my reaction from my first viewing is mixed.On one side, there are so many positives about this film. The casting is spot-on, with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling perfectly fitting their characters. The visuals in Barbie World are vibrant and exciting. The humor is excellent and made me genuinely laugh out loud. Not to mention the brilliance of Allan.On the other side, the film has an agenda and they push it hard. The message of female empowerment is strong, but at times it crossed over into preachy territory. My theater hardly laughed and the entire row in front of me walked out about 3/4 through. While I loved the moments in Barbie World, I did not enjoy the scenes in the real world or anything with Will Ferrell.At its core, this movie is a powerful reminder of what life is like for a woman (i.e., America Ferrera's monologue) and a call to action for me. Unfortunately, the in-your-face approach might alienate some rather than inspire.Best Character: Ken (Though Allan was brilliant)\n",

      "The movie has a very clever intro, a charming set-up filled with sight gags, and some hilarious lines (especially those spoken by the narrator - Helen Mirren).However, it's essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men (the Kens) and when they discover they are only disaffected props, they create a toxic patriarchy (although we never see how they do it). The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience. If you want to see a film where feminism is funny and wins in the end, see Legally Blonde.\n",

      "I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.\n",

Everybody enjoyed this and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I didn't expect to enjoy. I thought at first that it would just another mediocre movie but I was so wrong. Somehow everything about this movie put together worked so well. Ryan Gosling as Ken and Margot Robbie as Barbie both casts did a fantastic job. I would absolutely rewatch this as it was better than I expected. I highly recommend this.

      "Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.\n",

      "This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.\n",

      "Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.The biggest problem with this movie is that it leans HARD into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by MEN (as if we're some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) AND the only acceptable man is an Allen (wimpy effeminate man). This movie could've provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the \"equity\" side. The side of \"well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they've done unto you.\" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would've been a 10/10, but they couldn't resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke's on me for taking our girls to it.Also, there's a monologue in the third act which could've been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I've ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It's not just a woman thing.Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. It just didn't line up with who Barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.In the end, THIS KEN (me) cannot recommend this film to other Kens. Unless you're the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole \"women are oppressed\" narrative. Then you'll probably love it. Every other guy though? Or the women who love them? I'd recommend taking a pass on this one. Or watch the first 75% and then leave.Bottom line this is every bit as \"toxic\" as some forms of masculinity. This is just \"toxic feminism.\" And I say that as a feminist.\n",

      "I hope you won't let the title of the film fool you; this is not some family movie for little girls. It is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great Greta Gerwig, and an instant classic cult film.It provides some excellent comedy, and at the same time some very clever contemporary commentary on feminism and patriarchy from both sides, in Gerwig and Baumbach's usual styles. Very well-written overall.The cinematography is very uqique, one might say characteristic from Gerwig, but it has its own unique weird, twisted style to it. And I love it.Overall, a very fun film that is certainly deserving of all the praise and hype it has gotten.Like last year's \"Everything and Everywhere all att once\", this is truly a genre-bending experience that I very much hope make it to the Oscars.

      "Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I've been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10Next, I have to talk about Greta Gerwig's clear love of cinema. From the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001: A Space Odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed, to a hilarious Matrix reference, and then the overarching clear love of old Hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals. The dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute BLAST!Then there is the acting. It almost feels wrong to say it, but there's no denying that Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. His comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we haven't gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty. Margot Robbie is absolute perfection, the most obvious casting for Barbie ever in the history of the world, but don't let that fool you. Her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here. She really is one of the best actor of this generation. The rest of the cast also absolutely kills it. America Ferrera Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Will Farrell, etc etc etc, everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance. Acting is 10/10THE MUSIC!!!! It is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original Barbie album for this film. I'm not always a hard pop music kind of person, but it went so perfectly with this film, that I had to order myself a vinyl copy. But best of all, Ryan Gosling's performance in \"I'm Just Ken.\" The dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious. I can only pray that it is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem, can you imagine it?!? Music is 10/10And finally, the script. See how I managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on? This script is hilarious, SO smart and witty, and deeply poignant and emotional. It hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years. I love that even though Barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywhere(I personally did not find that to be the case for me, I was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me) we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll, all of her careers, the fact that there was an Astronaut Barbie before there was a woman working at NASA, etc. Then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy!! If anything in this movie seemed false or offended you, I don't even know what to tell you. This felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman. So many women have shared America Ferrera's monologue, and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. And I say that as a big Matchbox Twenty fan!All in all, this movie for me is a masterpiece, it's stunning, hilarious, emotional and the most fun I may ever have had in a movie theatre. Cannot recommend strongly enough! Easily my favourite movie of 2023, can't imagine how anything else could come close.\n",

      "I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a \"good movie\" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an \"everyone movie\", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of \"Barbieland\". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to \"do anything to see it in theaters again\", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.\n",

      "Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is. Two the cinema was packed (two-thirds female) and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The only films I have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences. No comment!\n",

Amazing soundtrack aswell though I felt some songs couldn't be heard very well at all.

      "When the execution banks on shrewd humour and clever writing, the movie thrives as a vivid spectacle, as a lighthearted entertainer, but whenever it delves deeper than the surface and enthusiastically seeks for the hidden under-layers, the psyches of Barbie and Ken, their understanding of the world and their impaired perspectives, the output just becomes so much fuller, the film comes to be something else altogether.However, the emotionally motivated instants seldom come out in the open, as the narrative, for the most part, leans on the fun, humorous side, and frankly speaking, it was bound to be like that.After all, it's a feature that is made mainly by keeping younger audiences in mind. It's just that Greta is a great storyteller, and I think highly of her directorial skills; thus, I expected to see more of 'her'!\n",

      "Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing \"lego movie\" and \"barbie goes to the real world\" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera's character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn't come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.\n",

And as far as the depth of the 'message' is concerned, all I can say to the writers and director is: do not give up your day job.There is nothing wrong with delivering an important message, however, to be effective it must be done with persuasion and not a sledgehammer.

Loved the characters, loved the production design and love love the acting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusing.Certain characters portraying Mattel exec were added in but in the end they don't really represent anything because their characters doesn't evolve.. and for me it feels to forced to put Mattel in there as a character because of course the would like to look like they are neutral or even a solution, to which we thought, was a problem. However since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question, do we really need to see the Mattel executives in here?It certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated, convoluted and confusing for general folks like me.

      "Leading up to the day I went to see this movie, I avoided as much advertising as I could as to avoid spoilers and go in entirely blind. But that being said, I learned very late that Greta Gerwig was the director of this film, and therefore, was not prepared for the emotional journey I was about to be taken through.This movie was unique, creative, fun, and so special. The music was excellent, the cast was wonderful, the costumes were amazing, it was funny, and the choreography was fun.As for it's flaws, this movie did have some uneven pacing. I felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary (namely, most of the Mattel chase). Sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential, the ending felt abrupt, and there was little justice by the end of the movie (though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless, feminist fight).I was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience. From growing up to objectification by men. I was shocked to see Ken claim to love Barbie, only to objectify and hurt her later on; it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life. Overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and I enjoyed it a lot.I didn't expect to cry during the fun, silly Barbie movie I had been so excited to see, but I'm glad it was as emotional as it was.\n",

It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious.

At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying \"I don't know\" then that's it we never learn, basically her saying \"I don't know and I don't care.\" They did so well showing Ken's feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken's low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it's okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it's men?Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?\n",

The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.\n",

      "When I went to sit down to watch barbie , I had high hopes. So many people had said so many good things about it, I figured they couldn't all be wrong. However, I should have listened to my friends who were not telling me good things. The movie suffers from mixed messaging, it is dull in places, very unfunny and is over long. It's not quite sure who its audience is meant to be, after all it appears to be appealing in places to children, but 97% of this film, they wouldn't get. If you're a person like me who has a visual impairment, it's not even completely accessible. In short, if you haven't seen it yet, don't.\n",

      "Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original. There were some really funny parts and some good acting. I loved some of the throwbacks and songs. Really was laughing at some of the funny moments.The story and pacing was a little off and uneven for me. Couple of the characters felt a little flat to me, but overall it was a well made movie. Some of the songs were really great and the camera work was really good as well. I wish the story felt a little more connected overall. The tone really shifted around a bunch of times and it got a bit distracting. A movie can be funny and serious.. but it just didn't seem to know what tone it wanted to be and was a bit conflicting to me. Overall still enjoyed myself.\n",

      "Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time. It is so much more than merely a toy. It will not longer be just 'a toy'I must admit, as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing, i had my doubts. So many things scanned through my head: one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy; another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a 'comedy'; and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me. Boy, was I wrong.Where do I start:To start off with, this is NOT just a comedy movie. Would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedy?This movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot, a plot that touches everyone's heart, a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the movie.Barbie focuses on the story of Stereotypical Barbie & Ken... Barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with Ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue. When reading this plot, it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy, action, simple film etc. However, this is only the PLOT... the storyline is very different.The opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood, stereotypes, a new generation etc. With Barbie (Margot Robbie) appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces, this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film. It is is symbolic in the sense that, the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with, it may also represent girls smashing or declining 'their dreams' due to female stereotypes (a topic that is heavy in this film) - I liked that Gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightly.Good comedic scenes are present throughout the film. Such as the jokes about Alan... however, even though Alan being on his own and not many people caring about Alan are seen as 'comedy' - I feel that there is much more behind Alan, and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier, and that Gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall. That being Alan may represent 'women' in the sense that in this male-dominant world, women are constantly feeling pressured and alone, and not listened to.I like how Gerwig didn't make a whole 'new' concept of Barbie... this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity. I particularly liked how when Barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car, this was symbolic as when young children play with Barbies, that is how they get their Barbie doll down too, they bring the barbie down as if it is floating, I really liked this detail, had innocence to it.Further on in the movie, the topics start to get heavier: For example when Barbie meets Sasha. Sasha described first world problems such as feminism, here Gerwig had SUDDENLY brought in these topics, without warning. Again, I liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding women's rights, and how quick this world is to judge women.Ken's storyline was also an intricate part of the movie, the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on Ken wanting to not just be Ken and Barbie, but wanting to feel important. In the end, Ken realises that he is important too. Gerwig does this really well.... Although this movie highlights topics relating to women's rights, the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal, and that was a nice message to finish the film off.The ending montage of childhood, barbies, children etc was a really heart-wrenching moment, a great way to end the movie... Gerwig played with emotions here, spectators started off the movie laughing, and ended in crying. Great way to showcase opposing topics.All in all, fantastic movie.\n",

      "There's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that I don't know how to express it correctly.Let me start by discussing a few parts that I really liked. First of all, Ryan Gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. A masterful and remarkable performance. While not Margot Robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. I didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.Another aspect I found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an Oscar for them. They were the best costumes I've seen in a long time. Similarly, the color coordination was superb.I also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. The comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.Now, moving on to the things I didn't like, and the area I'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. After watching a strong first half, I became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. Trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. The film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. I understood the message, but I ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.In addition, there's a part I absolutely disliked: Barbie's convincing Kens with their beauty and then reclaiming Barbie Land. It felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. It definitely could have been written more cleverly. Moreover, the metaphorical scene of Classic Barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. It was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.In short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. However, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. Women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. Let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. They are all invaluable, and so are we. Hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like Barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like Ken does.Note: Regardless of everything, people should stop comparing Barbie and Oppenheimer ; Barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.\n",

      "I initially thought this movie was this movie was about Barbie finding out that she was a toy, but she actually already knows that! Anyway, this movie was about Barbie getting real emotions and going to the real world to find the girl (revealed to be a grown woman) who's playing with her Barbie toy wrong. There's a halfway plot switch, as the second half is about Ken (well, the Kens) taking over Barbieland and changing it to Kenland. I admit that the second half isn't as good as the first. The movie probably could have been trimmed by twenty minutes and it would have been better. Will Ferrell is in this, but the problem is that he isn't used more.Wait, he was in \"Stranger Than Fiction\", a movie about a guy who found out his life was being controlled by a writer. He was in \"The Lego Movie\" as the father of a son playing Legos who found out they were alive. Now he's in this movie about Barbie finding out her purpose. Is this all the same character?! Anyway, the Kens aren't really villains and it's nice to see such a beautiful looking movie with great costumes, some great jokes and a fairly unique setup. Yes, the \"Barbie Girl\" does appear as a remix in the credits! ***\n",

      "Great visuals but the 'plot' felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadn't really thought through. A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though! It it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket, but the 'bait and switch' nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed.\n",

There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget. Thank you Greta Gerwig for my life.\n",

      "For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.The movie is well made; I could tell that the people who made the movie liked Barbie, and knew their stuff. And that bleed into the movie. It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.Anyway that's my review. I hope it's balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is .\n",

      "Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like \"Bombshell\" with Harlow and \"My Man Godfrey\" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.And like \"Christmas in Connecticut\", they often had a gentle but serious 'message' at the end, and America loved it. The woman is always smarter, generally with a plan up her sleeve, the male lead (most of the men in the movie) are oblivious. The more self-important, the more obliviousness they are to what's really going on around them. I'd now love to see Ryan Gosling in a re-make of \"It Happened One Night\", he'd be terrific. Or Margot Robbie in a re-make of \"Some Like It Hot\".\n",

      "Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023MILD spoilers ahead.\"Barbie,\" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year's best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one's head after leaving the theater.From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie's opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture's demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.\"Barbie\" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.Barbie - 65/100\n",

I wonder about any parents who might bring their children to see it expecting something quite different from what this film is. One hour fifty four minutes of fun from beginning to end. Satire, sarcasm , humor at every turn. Production values and acting off the charts good. I can't believe Mattel let them make the movie with complete artistic freedom. Think of Nicole Kidman in the AMC promo before a movie starts and says, \" Somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this \". Well somehow watching a silly spoof like this movie feels great all the way through and even afterwards. I loved it and I am not surprised at the huge box office , this movie rocks.\n",

      "Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.\n",

      "The movie starts off great, and has hilarious jokes throughout. For me, Ryan Gosling stole the show as he had the funniest lines and scenes. Some folks are mad about the women's empowerment themes, not me. Men have treated women as less than equal since the dawn of time, who are we to complain when they rightfully mock that? I don't mind the shots at the patriarchy, or even the fact that there's not one intelligent male character in the entire thing. What I don't like about this movie is Barbie's existential crisis. It's like they forgot the audience majority are children, and it feels like a pathetic bid for an Oscar. That arc was as off-putting as it was unnecessary. Had that element been replaced with more humor or at least a wholesome resolution, I would've given it a much higher score. They just took it to a place where it's less relatable for the children watching.\n",

I love the use of practical effects in creating a living playset, and most of the jokes at Mattel's expense land pretty well.The most common criticism I've heard is that it's preachy; and maybe it is.

      "Barbie is such a unique movie, it will probably become a very popular movie, at least a cult movie. Great songs ... it was a musical at times ... great talents. The jokes were embedded everywhere in the movie, the phrases, the T-shirts, the signs. I will have to watch the movie again to pickup on more of them.The movie starts with the individual issues with Barbie, and Ken, and then Ken's feelings for Barbie, and the lack of feelings that Barbie has for Ken.They are dolls, so some of the premise of the movie is really inconsistent ... and so many people, including myself, are trying to latch on aspects of the movie that they want to champion. Folks are now getting serious about the movie and its messages. Those folks must be too young to have gone through the '70s.I am not a movie fanatic, so I am not aware of the possible meanings that the writers/directors had.IMO, this is a gynocentric film, but it is supposed to be a spoof. The Barbie environment was created in a time of typical male/women roles, but exploited to an extreme. Barbie was always slim, white, and had some room for possible growth. Ken was a complete air-brain, only to accompany Barbie, possibly so she wouldn't look like a promiscuous woman.My daughter had no desire to play with dolls, especially Barbies, nor did I want her to; she had her favorite doll (not a Barbie), but it was more of a companion, she was not its mother. My son did not play with toy soldiers, he had no interest in them, nor did I want him to, nor playing with toy guns (probably not for the typical reasons). When he got older, it was limited to lasertag, with a clear distinction from reality.The movie skips around with Ken's understanding of his lack of value, Barbie's lack of affection for him; Barbie and Ken then learn about the \"real\" world. Barbie, of course, is devastated when she finds that real women don't have the same life as in BarbieLand, where women control the world. In \"real\" life, they don't do anything, they have no influence/power, important jobs (which can include just about anything), and are completely and utterly controlled by men. Right. That is realistic. The Kens find a completely different life as well, they actually can act like idiots.The Kens then go off on some idiotic campaign to overthrow the Barbies ... stupid, but funny. Great musical numbers. The Kens have been ignored for years, the Barbies objectified. This is when the film goes off on a gynocentric bent, only concentrating on the oppression that Barbies have had. Forget the Kens.The film apparently wants to get more philosophical/genuine at the end. This is ridiculous. There are booths at the theatre where photos can be taken, merchandise purchased, etc. This is nothing more than a money-making opportunity, keeping the same ideas. So now girls should be supporting this theme? Getting pictures taken with Barbie, wearing the pastel pink clothing that has been proven medically as causing epilepsy (a joke) ? I am not sure what new information the movie has for folks ... if any. Reading comments, some folks are actually considering the movie to exposing the problems of today. I hope society has progressed a bit further than the original Barbie concept, for both the Barbies and the Kens.This movie will become a cult classic.\n",

When they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown; like come on. As if it's not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism. You would at least think they would go for true equal rights(the thing which actual feminists used to fight for) at the very end but Nooo!

I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterBoy was I wrong. Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixIt's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movieMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time. Ryan Gosling as Ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as Ken.\n",

      "Just saw 'Barbie' today directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a bit difficult to rate. Slow to start - a tedious first 30 or 40 mins. Didn't like the lift from 2001 either. But the latter half with Gosling somewhat makes up for the beginning. His musical number was fantastic.Aspects of it reminded me of Pleasantville, PeeWee Herman's Big Adventure, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even a bit from the Matrix - some interesting associations.Overall kinda liked the movie but can only give it a fair rating. The Mattel chasing subplot was superfluous and detracting coupled with the slow start needing rework. Could have used better conflict focus and editing on the story I think. Needed to cut some of the vague ideas or loose ends and focus on theme of interpretation and melding of materialism/paternalism. Overall Mixed.\n",

      "Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.\n",

      "I somehow managed to convince my immensely macho friend to watch this film with me and boy was it an amazing experience! Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.\n",

      "The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.The plot starts in Barbie Land, where we witness Robbie's character's journey and her existential quest. Concerned for her designated child's fate due to the villainous scholiosis, the tall blonde takes action. The movie's second part shifts to real-life segments, offering hilarious situations with Ken & Barbie. The perfect doll believes she's found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise, realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land; nobody admires loving Barbies, and the Kens are the ones in control. In contrast, the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia. After finding her true partner in the child's mother and returning to Barbie Land, the toy discovers its destruction under a horse-loving, Mojo Dojo Casa House Living, and beer-drinking government. With a pep talk from her former playmate, she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl power.And this, without the inclusion of Matel and the ending. It tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes, but it has the wings of Icarus, represented by its 2-hour runtime.The main three themes are the search for one's self, the media prying on those who are deeply insecure, and the question of womanhood's position in society. However, not all themes were treated equally. The search for one's self, for example, had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others, becoming weird as the movie put it, and ending with the pursuit of reality, not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully. On the other hand, the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end, taking away from the main conflict.The movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between Barbie and the child of her owner, showing that Barbie isn't as glorious as she felt. However, after this, nothing truly develops. The kid joins the journey and sees that Barbie is a woman just like her, which doesn't really correlate with anything before that. To be honest, it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing, but I guess that is what solves the big Kenland problem. The middle ground gets taken by the character arc of Ken, and his performance steals the show, but the way it's solved pretty much trivializes the issue Ken was facing, making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to 'Men are big dumb-dumbs' is extremely unfortunate, as it was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie. However, you can't really rival 'I am just Ken' part.Something even more unfortunate was Farrell's character. He's such a good actor, but he was incredibly wasted in this role. I understand that it's a Barbie movie and kids will be there, and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles. However, couldn't they you know, not put Farrell? His role doesn't really scream expertise, and other than that, they aren't even plot-relevant. I feel like if they just cut this part entirely, the movie would have had a lot more to gain. Besides, the movie is PG-13, so they don't really need to consider slapstick comedy (sorry for offending Mr. Bean Fans).In conclusion, the Barbie movie is surprisingly more than Ken-ough. It provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances. However, it didn't deliver that well in its plot points. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, but you might be missing out if you don't watch it.\n",

But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.\n",

      "In my view there's two ways to watch / interpret Barbie. First, watch it with a critical eye about how Mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to 'normalise' Barbie. Second, just have fun. Both work. It is genius quite frankly. Mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that they'll be quids in with a new 'flat footed' Barbie.You should watch it and work out where you stand. To refuse to watch it because it's \"about a doll\" is missing the point in my view. It's a great movie to just watch and have fun with but equally you could watch it with a critical eye and work out where you stand.\n",

      "I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.\n",

The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script.

I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.\n",

There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that.

      "This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings. An excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter, wait for this one to release on DVD or streaming platforms.\n",

I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one).

      "When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.\n",

      "This might just be the best movie I've ever seen. The more I think about it, the more I realize just how genius it is! I mean they really thought out every little detail!My favorite part is that: if you love this movie, you get the movie. And if you hate the movie, you also get the movie. It truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it. It's for everyone.I'd like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment. We start off in a matriarchal society. However, it's a society created by little girls, so the Barbies are not violent towards the Kens. They just aren't obsessed with the Kens. The Kens are just in the background, this is representative of how children girls feel. Then, we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society. But not just any patriarchal society. It's a society created by adults. So we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies. Then, we go back to Barbieland and Ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him. He creates a toxic meninist movement, which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer. We cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes. The Kens start to become violent, even towards each other. This is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world. We can't even rely on each other sometimes. Women can be hateful towards each other as well. Finally, the movie comes to a close with Barbie taking a small step in the right direction. She says it doesn't have to be \"Barbie and Ken\", \"it's Barbie and it's Ken\". Now here's we're people start to get pissed. Barbie just got done saying that the Barbie's and Ken's need to start living as equals, but when when of the Kens asks to be on the Supreme Court the President Barbie says no that's too far, let's start with maybe a cabinet member or something.... Wow how could they... just kidding. You're SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY about this! This is an accurate representation of the real world! The movie literally ends with the Barbie world being an exact replica of the real world, only with the gender roles reversed.Another thing I'd like to point out is that even Ken says at the end that he didn't really like patriarchy anyway. He just wanted to ride horses. Again, this is because he is a doll in a world created by children. I think there's a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the POV of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything. Even Mattel is kind of shown as a \"bad guy\" in the movie, but even they say, they didn't make Barbie for her to become a sexualized standard. They made Barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother. With Barbie they can be anything they want to be. It wasn't until adults came along and taught us to sexualize Barbie, that we started to hold her to a different standard.I think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it. I think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it. Every person I've see criticizing this movie, I'm like you're SO CLOSE to the point. You're basically running head first into it. That is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie. It's a trap. You can't say hateful things about it, without PROVING THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!\n",

Greta Gerwig directs with striking bright vibrancy, but her co-writing (with Noah Baumbach) is bogged in its 'struggle against the patriarchy' theme (despite a light veneer).

      "I was never into Barbie as a child because I thought she's just a boring toy. The operative word being - toy. So when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist, sky high beauty standards, white skin and blonde hair, I thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because they're just jealous at someone else's success. It's easier to blast someone else's hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing it.The way children perceive toys remain unchanged. A young child who picks up a Barbie will not immediately think (if at all) they must aspire to have the doll's physique. Children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination, they don't think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy. The politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest. Ruth Handler created Barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll, she wasn't into politics or trying to change cultural standards.Gerwig's Barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many, many lectures to the masses. The movie looks like it's for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite. This is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin. Too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control, pointing out that it's a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiots.The portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping. Barbie (Robbie) goes into the real human world and she's heckled by men at the beach and if that's not a clear enough message, she visits a construction site where, you guessed it, the men starts to make derogatory comments as well. Then there's the Mattel HQ where it's of course run by men in suits who are naturally, idiots. One of the lower ranked male employee (Swindells) even say, \"I'm a man with no power, does that make me a woman?\" (What's with half of the Sex Education actors cast in this movie. The brilliant Ncuti Gatwa playing a hetero Ken!?)At just under two hours, you can guess why that is - there's not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point, you're wondering if this is a movie or a music channel. The second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boring.Robbie and Gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given. Barbie is an iconc doll and that's all she is, a toy - so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining. And in case you're so numb from all the preachiness, the Trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many 'isms' as possible by using Barbie as a prop.\n",

      "This film had to be more than advertising Mattel's famous doll, which set the standard for playthings fifty-odd years ago. And getting Greta Gerwig to direct a movie about Barbie, seems to have been a creative masterstroke. As expected, she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes much-derided doll, and it's a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightly.It looks spectacular, with Barbieland depicted with so much pink it could be nauseating, but the camera is moved around very skilfully so that images are fleeting. With most of the characters being Ken or Barbie, it is easy to follow, and the audience knows that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the pair to follow.The plot is simple enough, with Barbie suffering a trauma that causes her to visit the real world where some shattering illusions cause her to rethink her role as a female icon. Robbie is stunning in this role, she has always shone in playing over the top characters, and Barbie has given her plenty of scope for this. She is matched by a superb Ryan Gosling, clearly enjoying playing a downtrodden male who gets a chance to avenge his status, and the rest of the cast are all good as well, particularly America Ferrera as a Mattel employee who sees through the Barbie dream, and Will Ferrell, being the usual Will Ferrell as the boss of Mattel.I really enjoyed the film, but the second part was somewhat overlong. Gerwig also couldn't resist getting into a preachy mode as the ending approached. I docked two stars for that, but otherwise this film was the tonic the film industry needed. There have been too many mediocre films lately, this isn't one of them.\n",

      "Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?\n",

      "The opening sequence is such a precise, dead-on parody of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had to give that segment alone an A+++, which factored in to my overall rating and upped it a notch. Actually, the first forty-five minutes to an hour of \"Barbie\" is pretty funny, with some good satire and surprisingly dark undertones, like Stereotypical Barbie mysteriously having thoughts about death, so that helped, too.Problem is, when Barbie & Ken (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling) journey to the real world, the social commentary turns too serious and practically grinds the movie to a halt. Sometimes you're not sure if it's still parody or if they're trying to make a statement. And that pretty much takes the fun out of it.\"Barbie\" is best when it makes fun of all prevailing gender stereotypes, instead of zeroing in on how women are oh, so burdened, being as they are unfairly expected to be All Things to All People, & yada yada yada, giving the former Ugly Betty (America Ferrera) an opportunity to lecture us on the subject by delivering a preachy monologue. There are a few noteworthy moments in the second half, involving a Ken insurrection (a \"Kensurrection, perhaps?) and a side note on Barbie's origin with a nod to the doll's real-life creator Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), but by then the damage has been done.Watch the first hour for incisive, clever satire; after that, beware of banality.

I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.The basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny, but then you introduce \"real world\" characters into the movie after the first act (as shown in the trailer) and it seems to lose its way. Add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the female's expected role and you're left with...mush?Again, it has some decent satire one moment, but then also attempts to show heart the next. One example is how Ken discovers masculinity, but the way a 10 Year old boy might (trucks and horses), yet Barbie sometimes spouts off a simpleton's take on Camus or Neitzche. Honestly, at some points, there's a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth, but Ken is kind of a moron.Anyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term, meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapy.I wanted to like this more than I could.\n",

The plot made no sense.For someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics, it was a disappointment. Most women like to watch feel-good chick flicks as an escape from reality, and for the same reason, girls like to watch Barbie. But it was nothing like that, and instead I left the cinema feeling LITERALLY depressed. As a little girl, not a single part of me thought the old Barbie movies presented a Barbie who wasn't a strong figure. And yes, you can be strong, WHILE being in love.The way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art, but the plot made NO sense despite them trying to constantly spoon-feed it to us.In Barbie land the women (the barbies) are in charge and have everything while the men (the Kens) are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies. They dont even have houses. When Barbie enters the real word, she realises its the complete reverse. You'd think that Barbie would then REALISE that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens, then go back to Barbie land and FIX it. Instead, when she goes back to see Ken turning Barbie-land into Ken-land (because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world), she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to MANIPULATE the kens into FIGHTING each other so they can take back their power. Then instead of apologising to Ken (who was genuinely in love with her and had no TRUE bad intentions the entire movie - he thought the patriarchy was about horses) about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds, she simply apologises for not spending some time with him, then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to FIND himself. Then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie, simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect - and I get what they're trying to achieve here but I thought there would be a deeper reason? Perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable? Such as having empathy, or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulite?I get the intention of the movie, but it really didn't have to be that deep? I REALLY just wanted to have fun at a Barbie movie. The last thing you'd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women, politics, patriarchy, death, depression and anxiety. The beginning of the film was fun, but that fun didn't last long. But people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals.\n",

      "I took my whole family to this movie thinking it was something we all could enjoy at least a little. My two girls are 6 and 8... I realized going in that it's mostly for adults but I wasn't expecting it to be totally for adults given the theme. Too bad. My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame. I thought at the very list they could have ended it on a fun note for the kids but the ending really sucked for my daughters.\n",

      "I think Barbie has always been about women empowerment and I'm glad there's a Barbie movie that doesn't tiptoe around it to spare feelings. This movie was not marketed towards kids, it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with Barbie. It's an important message and it was told well. The cinematography was also incredible. Loved the costumes, the casting, everything about it. Margot played a literal perfect Barbie. I loved the scene where she was supposed to be \"ugly\" and the narrator made a joke about Margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her. Ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as Ken. Even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable.\n",

      "Like many, I saw the ads and read the hype surrounding this movie. And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.\n",

You can dress her and play with her in whatever fantasy you want . In a long scene, Mattel executives are chasing the now human Barbie to get her \"back in the box\" acknowledging its patriarchal structure. Is designed to keep women second class.

My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different.

She is suffering a crisis about herself and her existence and wants to go to the real world to have it solved. We see nice images from the real world and the Barbie's world and see several other Barbie doll types all along the movie. This story develops itself by a lot of conflicts mainly because at a certain time her lover Ken betrays her and tries to be the leader of Barbie's world which makes Barbie and her allies to fight him and his followers till the end in several intricate scenes till he is defeated and Barbie becomes a real woman with the help of Ruth, her creator.

The way they move in the Barbie world, is it children moving them in the real world, and speaking for them? Not-developed. The weird doll, what happened to her, how does she feel? Not-developed. The mother and daughter role? What's their purpose? Not-developed. The CEO and CFO? What's their story? What's their purpose? Not-developed. That Alain dude? Not-developed.\n",

I don't think is \"too preachy\" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn't have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed.\n",

      "This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the \"I am woman\" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.\n",

The movie did feel a bit long though, a few scenes that felt dragged out. I like the mother and daughter, they were like the audience's soul within the movie.The quote where mothers stand still to show their daughters how far they've gone/made it was really beautiful, my mother cried during that scene.Ryan Gosling shined a lot during this film and I liked that since he represented men. (In a way) opinion.Overall really super enjoyable movie for all ages. More so for the adults in my opinion, great message for the Barbies and the Kens of our real world.\n",

      "Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig. And the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Truman Show\"; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. \"Barbie\" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms \"Barbie\" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast \"Real Time\" in which he said: \"Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment\". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots, greedy, dumb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the \"Stereotyped\" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory \"diversity and inclusion\" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be \"empowering\" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the \"evil patriarchy\". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the \"toxic\" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile \"conservative fascist\". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the \"evil businessmen\" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are \"dumb\". The Barbies' plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).\"Barbie\" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.\"Barbie\" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, \"Barbie\" doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. \"Who is Barbie?\": the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity.\n",

I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie .

As though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout. If you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor don't expect too much. I think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other. Actors were all good but the story just let them down. Hopefully not a trilogy on the way.\n",

The film celebrates finding oneself and believing in one's potential, with Barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story. The film takes Barbie out of her traditional Dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time. This allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to. Visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on Barbie's journey of self-discovery in a real world setting she's unfamiliar with.\n",

The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.\n",

The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed.

      "I saw this film with an open mind. I was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way, either visually, through the actors, perhaps a fun story, or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with. Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clichéd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name). The movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes. In fact, it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writer/director's personal concerns. We were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the end.Most concerning is that Barbie was clearly modeled after the first Matrix movie but in all the worst ways. Barbie's world is a binary place composed of Barbieland, where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call \"The Real World\". The Real World is name of the place they travel to in Matrix as well but, in Barbie, it's not a dark hellish landscape run by machines. Instead, it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company Mattel. Also, the men are all shown to be domineering, rude, and chauvinistic. It's clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that it's as unrealistic as the one in The Matrix. A man walking by Barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside. She then gets arrested for defending herself (what??). While shes being arrested, the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more. The toy company executives all wear suits like the Agents in The Matrix and work in unrealistic barren, industrial looking cubicles. They also drive black SUVs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world. We get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in The Real World and I lost count of the number of times the word \"patriarchy\" was used. I know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian, bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world. In The Matrix, there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in Barbie there was mostly sadness in both. The movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning, then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses, and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible. The bright, colorful, happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark, depressing, and irredeemable. If it was meant to reflect our real world, well, it's so far out there that it doesn't even come close. If its mean to show a fantasy world, the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available. It was difficult to complete watching Barbie because it tried to say so much that, in the end, it said nothing at all. It was a fantasy film with only an unhappy, sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded.\n",

Although this time, there is no Saoire Ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films. This work Barbie, comes set in Barbieland's fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman. The moving plot of the Barbie fantasy world, conflict increases when entering the world of reality, and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story, which is a red herring type of plot; what is meant is that the author diverts the audience's minds, as in this film Barbie has to correct flat soles, but it is not the essence of the Basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase, with an amazing fantasy idea, between the difference between the world of reality and the world called Barbieland.I went straight to the point, which was the first time that Barbie, like women in general, felt insecure, she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach. This is my favorite scene, because it reminds me of my childhood, when I saw my sister crying because her Barbie doll didn't stand up straight. I got the meaning from that scene, that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places, in this film Barbie is a woman's childhood imagination playing with Barbie dolls, thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll. This adds up to Barbie's wish to go to the real world, to repair the soles of her feet, and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human, who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character Barbie, played by Margot Robbie. This is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment, in order to eliminate physical deficiencies, regardless of the morals contained in her, even though she is Margot Robbie too.The scene between the world of reality and the world of Barbie, in this case my analogy, the world of reality is represented against liberalism, and the world of Barbie is imagined conservatively, this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of Barbie by feminism, while the opposite of reality, there is control of the world of Barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner. Then the scene of an elderly grandmother, namely Ruth, whom Barbie first met, accidentally sat next to Ruth. My intuition at this moment, seeing the happiness of an old woman, whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences, thinking that beauty can disappear, and that's what Barbie feels when she looks back at Ruth, and also makes Barbie aware of her question about 'death' in the musical scene at the beginning of the film . This is where Barbie's maturity signifies when she returns to Barbieland.So that at the ending point, the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman, and the slogan \"She's everything. He's just Ken\", I interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable, experience social phenomena that occur, want to try new things until they get their point of freedom, the purpose of life is understanding everything, pride in being a complete woman who is, in expressing herself in a complex environment , especially women who live in a patriarchal environment. Finally, Barbie realized the meaning of girl, mother, grandmother, and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men, in this case, Ken.Overall, the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes, the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value, plus sarcasm scripts that contain, in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor. Regarding production design, without a doubt, maybe I championed this award was obtained by Barbie at the 2024 Oscars, because from that side it really broke marketing, the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches. I give Barbie: 7.5/100.\n",

      "I haven't seen a movie so funny, energetic, and overall amazing like this one in a very long time! I had somewhat high expectations, due to the good reviews (and the not good ones) and i love Margot Robbie and her acting, she was under-rated in Babylon. I'll just say, that my expectations were definitely reached! While funny throughout this movie is is fully hilarious at times, even if you think it would be some stupid \"all pink and glitter and rainbows\" flick, you'll definitely laugh (and you'll probably love it!). It's insanely funny and honestly touching in some scenes. It speaks a great message as well! Overall, will definitely watch again!\n",

      "To see a universe that's a Barbie world where the Barbies are the rulers and the Kens are just there to support Barbie brings our universe into focus. Ken doesn't feel loved and respected or important in the Barbie world. He steps into the real world where men are respected and many thing revolves around them and he realizes that he can be more. I hope that this movie could help men feel more empathy towards women and the way this world makes them feel less valuable and important. Women couldn't own property before and in Barbie world Kens didn't have a home to call their own or any important positions.Because women in the real world wear multiple hats, they have to be seen in many ways. They have to do many contradictory things to be liked. Women have to tie themselves in knots to be liked by other people. That's what this show tried to say too.I wish the Barbies realized how they were excluding the Kens and not treating them with respect and made changes to fix that. The world we live in is so male focused that we are so used to it that it seems normal and not unusual. But just like everything being ruled and centered on the women in the Barbie world seems strange, you realize the reverse is strange too.The movie had that message to me but it also was fun and light hearted and went by very quickly. It was enjoyable and entertaining.I guess the very end was not satisfying to me though. It got too weird and pointless at the end.\n",

      "Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or \"anti-man\", is part of the problem.\n",

      "I totally get it. The themes, the message, the irony. It's just I expected way more of an actual story and to come full circle but it just left me feeling odd.Positives: The film is beautiful and there's many laugh out loud moments. Both my partner and I did on many occasions. I liked the change from barbie land to real life. I liked the shock at seeing how much of a man's world we live in.Negatives: I found the endless cameos and useless one liners really odd. From Will Farrells colleagues just popping up for one word to celebrities constantly saying 'hey barbie, bye barbie'. It just felt so odd.The ending seemed to not really finish the movie. For me, I expected when the barbies got their homes back they'd then start a new way of life where they share with the Kens. Instead of going straight back to female only or female led spaces. Isn't that just as oppressive as the misogyny they're against in the real world? So they've not learnt from the events that have happened.As well as the montage section I really didn't get that bit and I'm a 33yo female.Maybe I set my expectations too high from all the hype. I would actually like to watch the movie again to see if I still feel the same.\n",

But I did show emotions in it but not as prominent , the movie will help people through times that some people have not been through (ie men) but even if you are a man I would still recommend this movie I have no real big complaints but also nothing to right home about that won't give anything away. Other than it's humar and when to use it , the movie knows when to crack a joke and when to move the plot further, I did really like the premise I'm glad how they went for the story and once again i would recommend it to anyone, most complaints that I have heard in person are from people that didn't give it a good try.\n",

      "Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he finds more things that can be of his benefit, MEANWHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be AND BECOMES A DASH before things go to late.A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead from it. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repercussion for the Ken Movement.I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5.\n",

The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.\n",

It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.\n",

      "\"Come on Barbie let's go party!\"A comedy fun for audiences. Laugh, laugh, cry and laugh again. The first film I've watched that Greta Gerwig directed and I was impressed on how she was able to pull off a good film.Probably not the typical toy to live action movie set up but it really has the feels of Toy Story (crossover maybe? Kidding). What the film offers is a lot of comedy which movie viewers will likely to enjoy. It pays homage to the different types of Barbie dolls but that depressed and ordinary Barbie were the best in this film. With Barbie, there comes Ken and Alan? But Ken was not sidelined in this film. In fact, I kinda felt more empathy on Ken's side than on Barbie's. Yeah this is a film based on Barbie who of course we know that without Barbie, there won't be a Ken. However, this film shows its viewers that it shouldn't be that way. Ken is as important as Barbie. On the other hand, that speech of \"Gloria\" was really moving and very inspiring.This film takes us to a world where toys and humans interact. Where those who live in a cycle can break the chain and have a decision to make. Where every individual has a choice and every person in this world is as important as the other.Barbie is 7/10. Enjoyable, fun for family however as my friend have said, there were scenes in this film that felt like \"what's next?\" or some parts felt like fillers. Still, it was enjoyable and a good film.On the side note, Greta Gerwig, PLEASE DO WELL ON NARNIA ADAPTATIONS. In the meantime, where to buy that \"I am Kenough\" shirt?\n",

      "The much anticipated Barbie movie. It's unreal to see a packed theatre 3 weeks after release, what a summer for movies.This film was so much fun. I had a perpetual grin on my face the entire two hours, only growing wider with every joke. I'm glad I experienced it in a theatre setting, laughing along with others is a great feeling - and there was plenty of laughs to go around. Genuinely one of the funniest films I've seen in a while, the adult-targeted cultural/societal humour really, really worked. Theres not much to say about the set design, costume dept., hair, makeup, and sets other than its nothing short of awe-inspiring. The production design is pretty much flawless. Also, the movie references and homage payed to classics like 2001 and the Matrix was very, very much appreciated. My only complaint would be the third act of the film. I feel like the fast, satirical humour of the first two acts worked perfectly, challenging and poking fun at cultural, societal and political norms, but doing so in a clever way which serves the story and script - gracefully. The third act throws this creative ingenuity out the window by way of heavy handed, in-your-face monologues.\n",

Isn't badness defined as the quality uniting things that humans love?Let's start from the beginning to see where I got it wrong. In the beginning, the good God creates the universe. Ialdabaoth then creates humans in his image. Humans then excrete the civilization they love today. But somewhere in the middle of that rancid dumpster fire, there's a good movie created to sell dolls to little girls.This can mean only one thing.

I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive \"person's\" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it.

With dopey Ken as her companion, Barbie journeys to Real World where, not to put too fine a point on it, things are just irrevocably messed up. Greta Gerwig's glossy, sparkly, splashy, musical satire offers up dazzling visual eye candy, with double entendres, clever and funny critiques of consumerism, femininity, mansplaining, and the hierarchical system. Opens with such flash and snap, until it veers off and stumbles over itself trying to hammer home its message while searching for a real plot, and then reverts into some formulaic battle between the matriarchy and patriarchy with shifting sympathies that actually confuse its themes. Nonetheless, an obsequiously grinning from ear to ear Robbie is ideally cast, but so is daft, superfluous Gosling making it hard to deny. **½\n",

      "Barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with her.Entering Barbieland is breathtaking. It's built exactly like a child's imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics. The first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours. The dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where I would create these kinds of scenes with my toys. I wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real world.Ryan Gossling stole the show. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much. It was iconic how Gerwig reversed the narrative and made Ken into the typical representation of women in film. The film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film. With references of Space Odessey, the Matrix, The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and hundreds of others, it made the film have that much more depth.I feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit. The quests Barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me. It offers comic relief, but I believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how Barbies \"saved\" us. The mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative. Other than having 0 personality or depth, we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives. They could have been better written, or removed all together. The monologue sequence was a mistake. Show me how women live in this world instead of telling me. It sounded too preachy for me, despite me being a feminist. If we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter, and more on giving concrete examples of women's pressure, it would have been a stronger film.The story and characterization is also lacking at Mattel. We never get a conclusion to why Mattel went back to Barbieland. The story felt incomplete, and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers. This brings me to argue that we didn't receive the movie that was intended by the director. Although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women, it could have been pushed even further. Perhaps the large presence of corporate players like Mattel and Chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire. I was expecting a Kubrick kind of satire, and as much as we did get some of that, more subtle satire could have been beneficial. I have full confidence in Gerwig's skills which is why I'd be curious to see a directors cut. Let's petition for it!The ending was also disappointing for me. I felt like I was watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 for no apparent reason. Perhaps they didn't really know where to go with the story and I'm shocked they chose that. I liked that we got to meet the creator of Barbie, but there was something missing for me. Overall, this was a fun time. I think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes. I look forward to watching it again in the future.\n",

It certainly isn't the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn't find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays \"actress Barbie\" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn't anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director's other film - Little Women.\n",

      "This is a fun, clever film that does about as much with its premise as it possibly could. Margot Robbie is cast as a doll with a reputation for an unrealistic body type. Finding a way to make a doll not only human but relatable and compelling enough to anchor a feature film is a daunting challenge, but somehow Robbie does just that while also managing to look the part. Appropriately, the art direction is playful. For all the inventiveness of this film, its concept occasionally leaves its screenplay unfocused.In her live-action, big-screen debut, Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.\n",

      "I loved so much about this movie. From the costumes to the sets to the colors to the soundtrack to the excellent comedy. I also really loved the plot and takeaway of the film.With that said, as someone who believes deeply in the message, it was a little bit too preachy. It laid the message on very thick. And I get it; it's an important and very real topic that has a massive amount of cultural relevance. But we have to give the audience some credit that we can get the idea without the repetition.That doesn't detract from what a fun yet emotional movie this is. Ryan and Margot are amazing, as are all the supporting cast members. It's a movie worthy of the massive craze, for sure.\n",

      "Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a \"Dimensional Membrane\" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn't funny. It's pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn't say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it's tone, and doesn't live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren't. This must have cost a fortune to produce. The money could have been better spent.\n",

      "Barbie has color and some music and dancing. There's no movie in there though, as taken as a whole it's a mess of illogic and heavy handed pronouncements. The \"real word\" is as fake as a 3 dollar bill. A universe called real world might be thought of as portraying, well, the real world, but it doesn't. When straining for humor, it mostly doesn't work. Furthermore, none of the characters in Barbie are interesting or someone one wants to relate to in a narrative. Some of the historical Barbie items are interesting to look at. Why this movie is popular I don't know, but the film will soon be forgotten.\n",

      "Released: 21st July 2023 (UK)Certificate: 12ADirector: Greta GerwigLoved by critics and the average movie goers. Film buffs like my myself will love it or hate it like marmite. Myself I'm gonna put it in my guilty pleasure list of films. I'm so glad Greta Gerwig is becoming recognised as a film director and writer because one of her previous films Lady Bird was outstanding. She is also known for acting in a great horror film Ti West's The House of the Devil and the brilliant Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs.The film was very entertaining with its hidden adult jokes and how glamorous the world of Barbie is to look at. The soundtrack will become very memorable that will eventually linger with you after the film has ended. Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is the perfect choice, but for me I think Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show more for me. Either way I loved them both! I think they both lead the film perfectly. It was great seeing Micheal Cera again after going under the radar for a while. I remember he was becoming a rising up actor in my college years in films like Superbad and Juno. Also it was great seeing Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon being crazy as ever. I loved the little cameos from John Cena as Mermaid Ken and Rob Brydon as Suger Daddy Ken. Let's not forget Helen Mirren as the sassy narrator. It was really sweet seeing Rhea Perlman again too. She was great in 1996's version of Matilda as the very wacky mother.How fun the film is it does suffer from originality. The idea behind it has been done to death in films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Last Action Hero and Space Jam. Where I said it's like marmite is because there were moments that I felt like it was a bit strong on the political messages and mental health on today's society; if you are looking to watch a film for some escapism where in my opinion that's what the magic of movie experience is all about. Other than that the film is well paced with its decent runtime.\n",

      "It wasn't bad at all; it's funny and certainly worth watching. Margot Robbie delivers a brilliant performance and perfectly embodies the character, bringing the iconic toy to life.Barbie, as a doll and figure, became immensely popular and essentially replaced the term 'doll' itself. In the past, any such toy was simply referred to as Barbie.The movie explores how these figures became companions to many, more than just toys. It showcases an alternate world of Barbie in a joyful and beautiful manner.It's a good movie with plenty of laughs and overall enjoyment. Simply sit back and enjoy this one.\n",

All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly...\n",

      "I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing \"Barbs\" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say,\n",

Started off in a silly critical mode, and then went downhill.Pretending to be political, social etc but doesn't even get near. Trying to be serious when all it's managing to do is show everyone as stupid and self centred.What is more depressing is how people find this funny. We've completely lost our humour and taste of what is funny and what is not.Very disappointed. In the past we used to rate these films as B or C movies.

The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again.

      "First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.It tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than women.The movie is about laughing at how basic, stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is. If you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what I'm talking about.I must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points. It was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen. I went to see the movie making a double session after seeing Oppenheimer so that may be why I notice the difference about the audience.If you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problems.Basically, if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad. If you are a girl taking over a guy then it's all good. The movie supports the extreme left, politically btw.At the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they don't need each other and can live by their own. It's a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl. It tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when Barbie gets cellulitis it's then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes. Also let's include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason let's not include fat Ken or paralytic Ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit, clearly not body-shaming guys...If you are wondering why I haven't spoken about any of the plot, well... that's because there isn't one besides vibes and ideologies.I was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi+ comunity. If there is a movie for it, it's this one but I'm glad they did not force any of that.It's sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits, tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it. I came out of the movie worried about where society is going and I think that was not supposed to happen.\n",

      "Entering the cinema with the expectation of a colorful and girly adventure, I was surprised to find that this movie delved into deeper societal issues, transcending its supposed joyful facade. It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world. It made me realize how our society has always been so misogynistically setup.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie\" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called \"Barbie\" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the \"Real-World\" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.\n",

It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and find new jokes, there's just so many! If you're uptight about the way many women feel how they \"fit into\" society, then this movie may not be for you. But, you're missing out. I hope the academy finally starts recognizing comedies. It's so much more difficult to write something funny and be an actor that can pull of true comedy than drama. It just is. You have to be new, creative and intelligent. Dramas, you can just play things that people automatically get emotional about, It's so hard to figure out what many will find funny, yet alone hilarious. The Academy should nominate Gosling (sp?) for best actor, Robbie for best actress, the move for best screen play and movie. It was just so creative and funny.

It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie.

I wish they had a solid and fun ending, but they tried to go a different way, which didnt sit well with me. Don't want to really comment about the feminism empowerment, I am all for it but it was too in your face, and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie, ruined the entertainment for me. Being a women, there are of course many issues faced in reality. But this one didn't really nail it.Among the performances Ryan Gosling was really good as Ken.

It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels.

      "Male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships, as it tends undervalue any other form of love. It results in a current (and big) social problem: straight men who have zero valuable, deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives. Men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love. That's why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend, a husband, a provider.Ken and Barbie had to enter the real world to realize this, among more important and focal problems related to feminity and the place of women in society (which were precise but I don't write about because, as a cisgender man, I think is more valuable if I talk about masculinity and male problems). They question their identity and Ken realizes he doesn't know himself or his place if he doesn't have Barbie by his side.This is not something that I see discussed much in commercial cinema, so I'm glad it was and that's why I focus only in that subject in this review, because it was my favorite message related to the male characters. With the rest of the movie there are many things that could've been done better, such as the self critique/parody and the meta-irony, but the good elements surpassed the negatives ones in my opinion. It's a fun movie, it's very simple, but you know, sometimes less is more (and I think it's better that way in Barbie).It's not the movie of the year and it's definitely not Gerwig's best or deeper film, but it's worth noticing the biggest commercial flick of the year to be a sort-of gender issues 101 to people who might haven't even question their gendered role in today's society beyond \"men work, women shelter and that's screwed up\". It's as feminist as a Hollywood commercial film can be.My favorite Barbie is Hari Nef's Doctor Barbie.\n",

      "I only saw this movie for Ryan gosling and I was not disappointed. Bro brought the humor into this movie like he does with every movie that he is in. His performance was impeccable and kenough. To be fair I was a bit high so I was laughing a lot in the theatres and I was with my gf also seeing the movie. And I just love how Ryan aka ken brought the character to life in a special way. And of course the song he made is just absolutely wonderful in everyway. One of his best performances ever highly recommend for kids and for families to go and enjoy themselves. As Ryan gosling would say I'm just Ken and I'm enough.\n",

However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more..\n",

I sit through nearly every movie I begin watching because in most cases there is a twist or a catch at the end that explains weaknesses of the movie in the beginning.But Barbie movie is one of the few I turned off after nearly one hour into it.This movie is just nonsense. A waste of time better spent with cleaning the house or doing other loved or unloved things.I don't understand why this movie is hyped so much. It is nothing more than a GI Joe for girls, which is sadly at least not as less entertaining as GI Joe.I guess even for Barbie Fans this might be hard to watch.\n",

      "Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.Margot Robbie's every single action, either crying and laying down on floor or smiling while kissing, is exactly same as a Barbie doll.America Farrera's monologue deserves multiple nominations. She stole the show. Simu Liu was fantastic in it and actually made me sad for Ryan Gosling's Ken.Ken Song is another masterpiece of this movie but it's not as iconic as Will Ferrel calling himself the 'mother' but the best part about the movie was including and remembering Ruth, the founder of Barbie, and her daughter Barbara.The movie broke the wall in unexpected ways, it's classic comedy direct to audience was one of the many great aspects that I loved.Even though I expected a better ending for Ken and other Barbies the movie ended on a happy note which delighted me.\n",

Music too loud at times too.I do like the message it gets across. It does make me think about the power imbalance of genders and possibly how all genders are oppressed under the patriarchy. It was pretty well done considering how many messages they need to delivers in such a short time. However, I do wish the story was a little bit deeper and that the twists and turns are a little less straight forward. Too much to ask? Maybe.But I like it and feel more empowered after watching.\n",

The parallels between the professions of the Barbies and reversals - reflects how we've gone from Mary Richards to ... well you know.Greta Gerwig has taken every facet of the human condition and put a pink glow on it.I laughed, I pondered and I cried.

It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring.

      "The long-awaited and well-publicized Barbie movie is a way for Mattel to apologize for the mistakes they made, to achieve greater acceptance of the new generations, trying to imply that they are going to change those mistakes, but doing it in the best way. Form of advertising possible. Visually it is a colorful and striking film, which reminds us of many Barbie ester eggs, recalling many things from childhood (I was never really a Barbie fan). It is a friendly film for adults and children, I think that each age group will understand according to\n",
      "be age. I knew that it couldn't be a bad movie since it has a very good director, luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story. It is a criticism using humor, about feminism, machismo, patriarchy, about what women face (I had never thought that Barbie was nominated by women, however her mistake was wanting perfectionism), about existential doubts, the world dominated by men on many occasions, the relationships of mothers and adolescents, the daily routine, trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate, I think it is a film that, being well analyzed, has very good components and a very good plot, something that one never imagined from a movie about Barbie.\n",

Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.\n",

I have to say that at least every girl should watch this movie!!!The representation of girls \"in a man's world\" and the difference between a fantasy and the reality are shown greatly, but apart from that, the movie and the script just carry such a powerful message towards women that should be heard. When I went out of the cinema, I felt so empowered and self-confident!Kudos to Greta Gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for women.Another important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it!!! Margot Robbie played her role so well, I was actually convinced she was Barbie, and Ryan Gosling had the absolute best facial expressions. I enjoyed watching them sooo much. Worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses: THEY WERE ALL AMAZING!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise. Everybody managed to portray their characters so well!!!One of my favorite scenes was the fight between the Kens because of how realistic the actors played it!And the costumes and decorations/houses should also be acknowledged. I watched the Dreamhouse Tour on YouTube and I appreciated all the detail so much! Barbie's cowboy costume was the banger, I think that was my favourite fit from the entire movie.And the music!!! \"I'm just Ken\" is still stuck in my head, and whenever it comes on shuffle, I scream to it dramatically. :) But it's not only this song, I keep listening to the Barbie Album on Spotify because all the songs are so catchy!!!I really want to rewatch this movie!!! It's a solid 10/10 from me. :) (I'm a girl, btw, if you couldn't tell xD.)\n",

Sure, it's a fun movie and Margot Robbie is gorgeous as Barbie (and Ryan Gosling is a perfect Ken). But the movie is, in fact, an interesting commentary on, both, patriarchy (and the negative effects Barbie dolls have had over the years) as well as on mortality. The movie is more profound than I would have thought. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the open-mindedness and humour of Mattel. What is missing is that the movie sometimes lacks intensity and becomes only candy for the eyes.I'm giving 7/10 to Barbie.\n",

Well after 10 minutes we already wanted to walk away fromt he movie. Its totally overhyped, bad script, sort of these typical teenage american football humor movies, which is very cheap and dull to watch. There was litterally nothing entertaining or nice about the movie. The scenes in the matell headquarters were overly childish. Maybe one truth was well demonstrated in the movie: everything was pink, the houses in barbieland did not have walls and the drinking cups and shower had no fluids in them.

      "\"Barbie\" is a film that left me with mixed feelings. While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling's exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.Spoiler alert: The film's message about embracing uncertainty and self-discovery was commendable, but the execution sometimes seemed confusing. The protagonist's journey towards self-acceptance could have led her to a simple job, symbolizing personal growth. Instead, the choice to visit a gynecologist seemed a little too on the nose.One standout aspect was the beautiful message conveyed through Billie's song, which added an exquisite touch to the film. Overall, I'd rate \"Barbie\" 7/10 stars for its strong performances and emotional moments, but it could have benefited from a more focused approach to its messages.\n",

      "I enjoyed this film. I cried at the ending and I laughed out loud at some parts, which is something not many films can actually do to me. I LOVED the visuals - it felt exactly like Barbie should feel to look at, and I love how the film never seems to take itself too seriously, which again, is what I expect from a film about a Barbie doll.Having said that, there were a few things I questioned. I'm not the target audience (being a 17 year old guy), but also... who WAS the target audience? It feels like it should be for kids, but it was far too existential for that, especially at the end, and some of the jokes were just blatantly sexual. Was it for people who used to own Barbies as a kid? It was still enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even children at all, really.I feel like I have to be careful saying this, but the message of the film was a bit over the top. I understand it and I liked that it was there, but it felt a bit crammed down our throats. It almost feels like a caricature of our own world at times. The real world sucks, but the divide between men and women isn't THAT pronounced - not all men are incompetent, macho freaks who have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and not all women are suppressed as intensely as the film seems to suggest. Still, it was a good message and made me emotional at points, and it was still a fun film experience, albeit not what I was expecting.\n",

      "As of today's date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I've liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera & Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets & atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn't convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie & Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that \"domination\" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I'm a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning.\n",

I feel like this is being rated higher because people think there's an important message in there but this shouldn't distract anyone from the fact that it's a very, very bad film with a terrible storyline. After a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable. The storyline is what you'd expect from a poorly written children's film, but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme. Box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly. Only highlights were Margot Robbie's performance and Michael Cera and Kate Mckinnons small but funny parts.\n",

      "My only-ever memory of a Barbie doll was the one my cousin sister once owned, and I secretly sabotaged, owing to some temporary argument in our childhood. I do remember that it was a stereotypical version, with blonde hair and a pink (or some shade of it) dress. I made that once-good-looking doll into Crazy Barbie, by drawing weird shapes on her face, pulling some of her hair out, and twisting (at least) one of her plastic limbs. I also remember hiding away some of the crockery (tea cups and the like) shortly after. Well, this film brought back that repressed memory, which I don't think I apologized to her for. Of course I did so, afterwards, and that's how rewarding the movie felt for me.The first act of Barbie was deliberately \"plastic\", as if Gerwig was trying to reinforce the idea of how a perfectly feminine world exists. The \"Hi Barbie\"s were starting to get a bit annoying, and the unabashed celebration of \"every night being girls night\", and women basically holding all decision-making power came across as Gerwing trying to impose the blunt idea that if women are involved in everything, the world automatically becomes a better place - no questions asked. When you perceive this through a man's lens, it's actually pretty brilliant. This is exactly what women must feel, at least frequently, when they see us celebrating masculinity even to toxic levels. Robbie is the perfect choice to portray stereotypical Barbie, and that's purely because she can make us feel for the character's existential crisis just as much as we can adore her looks.The film's binding strength, however, is Ryan Gosling's Ken. As the film progressed, it almost felt like if this were a movie about Barbie questioning her existence and just fighting Mattel's idea of corporate villainy, that would've been clichéd. Ken's presence adds an intriguing layer - when he and Barbie make it to the real world, and concludes that \"men rule the real world\", he becomes the antithesis. He gathers all Kens in Barbieland and makes them acknowledge patriarchy. At this point, as much as I was entertained by Ken's antics, Barbie's realizations, and the wonderful production design, costumes, and soundtrack, I wasn't sure how Gerwig would tackle the final act. The first two acts came across as both sides being somewhat toxic, what with the sidelining of the opposite gender for no apparent reason.But, the final act is a masterstroke. Other than Gerwig's decision NOT to fully antagonize the corporate that manufactures Barbie dolls (and their excessive product placements), because well, they co-produced it, the writing is brilliant. The fact that they allowed Gerwig to go this far itself is refreshing. It acknowledges errors on both ends, and understands how a balance is entirely significant. It asks Ken to stand on his own two feet, without having Barbie by his side always. It also pays tribute to Barbie's creator (for all her faults, including tax evasion), adding a couple of conversational scenes featuring her and Margot's Barbie that gives the latter some level of character closure. This is how you make a film based on a toy, and give it the depth it wholly deserves. Shine on, Greta! :)\n",

      "This film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set, costume, and prop designs. HOWEVER, the film shoves its agendas down our throats like it's thanksgiving dinner.The marketing team played it off as just a fun, harmless, self-aware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism, mockery of the entire male species, outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experience.The movie contrasts Barbieland as female-dominated/controlling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something. Likewise, in the real world, men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff. The film shows half the human population (the men) as utterly and irredeemably horrible.And by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team? Nope! The Kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the Barbies go back to their girl-power or ruling everything without thinking twice about it. It feels like they almost had a good ending, but simply just couldn't help themselves.In front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking \"Is it almost over?\" multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene. Do not take your little girls to this one. Truly a wolf in sheep's clothing. Using a kid's toy as a trojan horse for feminist messaging is just ridiculous.\n",

Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!\n",

      "It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.\n",

      "This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.\n",

      "I have questions: when the kens take over Barbie land, they see the Barbies as just accessories but then when the Barbies just swap places every ken still had a Barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening? I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls.\n",

      "As I stated in the title of this review first and foremost this movie is absolutely worth your time, especially with a rather short run-time that is an hour and fifty minutes.This movie has a ton of soul behind it and it shows, many of the scenes are just fantastically made and you could feel they aren't just corporate copy-paste pieces made to create a film.However, I do feel like Barbie suffers from the same issues that movies like 'Jojo Rabbit' do, while having the movie have a non-serious feel to it at times and switching it around certain scenes it really diminishes the value of both sides.Despite this, this movie is still Kenough like all of us.\n",

      "The movie is great. Everyone says it's very preachy but I actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner. It makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to - for example, why most cash has famous men on them, and not one woman (with some exceptions around the world, of course). It also presents Ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry - clingy, confused, a bit inadequate, annoying, etc.It's smart, it's very funny, it's interesting and it deserves the hype.\n",

      "The 1968 picture Planet of the Apes reverses traditional roles. After time-travelling thousands of years into the future, astronaut Charlton Heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate, and humans their chattels.I hated the movie as a boy, in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film. Could it happen, I wondered, where humans could become inferior to another species? If it did, would we deserve it? The film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure I have never dared rewatch it.The 2023 movie Barbie looks nothing like Planet of the Apes. Its cinematography is an exercise in high-octane kitsch, as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell. Yet it too explores role reversal, here between sexes rather than species.Barbieland is a quasi-mirror image of Realworld, the film's moniker for present-day California. Barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy. The Barbies, for they are multiple, live happy, fulfilled lives. They prosper at the top of every profession and public office. They never age, bodily imperfections are impossible, and life is a perpetual merry-go-round of choreographed parties, infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood. The men - the Kens - are decoration. They are unable to perform even basic functions: physical and sexual. They lack genitals. Their muscles are impressive but purely for show. They preen on the beach, but surfing is beyond them.One day, Classic Barbie (Margot Robbie) awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her high-heeled shoes. She no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes, but on flat, ordinary, soles, to the collective horror of her sisterhood.Robbie realises something is wrong, and - following a revelation from her compatriot Weird Barbie - sets out to Realworld to resolve it. Classic Ken (Ryan Gosling) stows away in her car. The duo eventually arrive in Santa Monica via a series of rose-tinted vehicles.It isn't long before Gosling discovers that Realworld is unlike Barbieworld. Here, the power is held by men. Gosling, surprised to be treated with respect, becomes fascinated with patriarchy, and quickly warms to the paradigm. For Robbie, the experience is the opposite. People mock her. Daily life is threatening, not fun. Her self-confidence warps into self-consciousness. Ken precedes her return to Barbieland, and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into Kendom, a toyish grotesque of Realworld, where the Kens are in charge, and the Barbies retained as ornamental servants.Much ensues. We race and chase SUVs with the mother-and-daughter pair who own Robbie's doll in Realworld. There's an overlong musical sequence, in which Gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in La La Land. Mattel's all-male c-suite, led by the one-dimensional Will Ferrell, provide limited laughs, and add little to the plot, beyond an admirable modicum of self-awareness. Products are placed - even Chanel! - with abandon. Still, we are being entertained and, mostly, engaged.The final act sees Barbie and friends manipulate the Kens and prevail. There are no suffragers in Barbieland and, following a unanimous referendum of an all-female electorate, the natural order of things is restored. A dark, compelling, twist looks imminent, but it never arrives.Rather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative, director Greta Gerwig retreats from it. Instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them, her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into well-trodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism: 'I die, therefore I am.'Robbie's Barbie eventually opts not to live in Barbieworld, but as a real, imperfect woman in Los Angeles. This is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary Barbieworld might itself become, but because she likes the idea of being human. How do the remaining Barbies perceive their homeland? Do they support gynocracy? Are they comfortable with the Kens being sidelined? The passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that, for the first 85 minutes, hammers home its message relentlessly and precisely.The narrator (Helen Mirren) assures us that one day the Kens might enjoy the same status in Barbieworld that women do in Realworld. It is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised, given the Kens are gainlessly employed, politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary. Barbie and Ken experience equality in neither Barbieworld nor Realworld: in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other. Perhaps Barbie ultimately prefers LA because, despite its manifold flaws, it at least has no pretence to being a utopia.In Planet of the Apes, we discover, in the final reel, that Heston's destination is not a dystopian otherworld, but Earth itself. Through nuclear war, man's hatred, greed, and hubris has caused his own downfall. The oppressor has become the oppressed; perhaps man deserves it? In Barbie, Gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion. Instead, she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie: a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of Hollywood, and Mattel.\n",

      "Was just okay. The acting is super, ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think. And margot is a perfect barbie, she ate her role up. !this is not a kids movie! Has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting. Most of the humour lands for me honestly, i thought it was cute. The diolouge isn't best but it's a movie about barbie what were any of us really expecting.It was kinda confusing towards the end. The begininng was really fun- maybe a little bit annoying but that's just me, like i said, not my type of film. The colors were great, the barbieland set was cute. After they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me. I thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over? Then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up? And everythings fine? They tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way. It seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene. I feel the feminist point of the film would've come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then BOOM big monolouge. It was just a lot, but empty at the same time.And i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think. Like, point proven, all women have had that happen to them. It was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfy.And nothing was ever really resolved in the real world? Besides the mom and daughter with barbie. And then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel, first female ceo, feminism, but no she's just going to the gynocologist. Yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didn't take it.Overall much different than expected. This dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for. Thought it was going to be lighthearted!So, idk. It was cute- i may be too hard on it cause i enjoy movies that make you think and have deeper elements. All the elements here were blatently there. Also i'm saying all this as a young adult female- i know i was one of the target audiences for this.\n",

      "Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.\n",

Gotta say, it's particularly touching. I didn't expect to get emotional but the movie got me one or two times. Margot Robbie is a star as always, and her acting absolutely delivers, showing the inner conflicts of the character, all in nuance and sincerity.This film is definitely not for kids, as it focuses on problems and dilemmas adults have to deal with. The writing isn't perfect by any means, but overall Barbie is a pretty fun adventure.\n",

      "This movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society. To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well.\n",

      "So, I just wanna say that I was very hyped for this movie. But after I watched this, I was a bit disappointed.The movie has a lot of cringe scenes. One of them are funny too, but at some point this is just cringe and too much.About the message of this movie, I agree with it and i like it because in our world women are really disrespected, harassed and so on, but at some point it was too much. I say this as a male, but one of my friends, who is a girl, has the same opinion. But the other one, with the mom and the teenager rebonding, that was amazing.The sound tracks are really good tho. To include artists like Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and so on is a great move to make this film an iconic one.The cast is great and I think Margot Robbie played Barbie perfectly with her acting and her appearance too.In conclusion, I recommend this movie because I think this is a film that anyone has to watch because it's a Barbie one, and it can also teach teenagers a lesson, despite the cringe scenes.\n",

However, the film seemed longer than Oppenheimer ( which is brilliant filmmaking). After twenty minutes I turned to a friend and asked if Barbie had a plot. Five minutes later a story did start to surface, but it was predicable and not terribly involving. Full disclosure: I never played with Barbie or destroyed a Barbie, so clearly I am not the intended audience. Still, there are some very clever bits, the design is super, the last line is a really laugh out loud surprise, and Robbie is a delight in anything.\n",

To address it all to mothers, specifically, and STILL touch the hearts of girls all around. To talk so, SO honestly about what it's like being a girl. To say it in the first ten minutes - \"I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth.\" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her \"imperfections\" make her. To make it about growing up, but also about remaining a child. To remind girls to be both. To make the perfect example of what adolescence means to a girl. Just genius.\n",

The sets are also amazing and the Barbie worlds they created vs. The fake real world sets that they made; really cool.The only part that got old fast was the preachiness of the writing. I got it the first 50 times you made it clear about feminism and that women should run everything and be everything. That is fine, but any filmmaker that keeps repeating their point or theme too much risks boring the audience by overstating or over playing your message.

So just a warning to parents, please heed the the PG-13 warning.I loved the clothes, shoes and accessories in this movie! As for me personally, Ryan Goslings Ken was as good as it was possible. Ken in any other world would be a \"10\"! Love that song! It was cute and very silly and super adorable! Obviously, Ryan Goslings is too old for Ken, so he did the best he could. Would I see it again? Not really. As a little girl I used to wonder what would happen if Barbie and Midge became real? I stopped playing with them, and learned to kiss boys.

      "What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it. To summarise the film: I AM KENOUGH!\n",

      "I'm only saying it could have been better because of the hype. I was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film. Firstly I'll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering \"patriarchy\" to be the most hilarious part of the film. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn't spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the \"perfect\" life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens. This also would have made me personally feel more like I care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that Barbie and Ken were experiencing when they went to the real world. Secondly, it's use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message. Finally, which brings me to my third critique, is that the movie didn't seem to be for kids but at the same time it was? My first argument for why perhaps the two critiques I have made might not be valid is because it's a kids film, and in that sense it would, well, make sense. But then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldn't be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message, not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children. Don't get me wrong, I love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at, which I argue Shrek did very well for example. However, the script of this movie (I'm not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons) just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too. Which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points I made.Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film and good in its own merits. Ken as a character made a lot of sense given his whole purpose as a doll in real life. And that essence I think they captured well. 7/10.\n",

      "Walk into this film, not completely knowing what to expect but came out pleasantly surprised. Good set designs a lot of good shots throughout the film. Pretty solid humor throughout the film. So overall good experience. But now, in terms of casting Margot Robbie was a great choice for Barbie, but man does Ryan gosling really steal the show almost makes me wish he was in more comedies. Will Ferrell also makes an appearance and there's a pretty good job. And in terms of the overall message definitely wasn't as preachy as most people put it out to be. So I don't think the overall message was as bad as some people had it out but overall a fan film would recommend.\n",

      "First of all, let me say that my score for this movie is 6.5, but thanks to the site, I cannot give this vote.I agree that this movie conveys a good message and concept, but I seriously don't know why it sold so much, but am I sad? Not at all. It makes me very happy that the movie was able to sell so much after Marvel's superhero movies.all actors have fully understood the concept of the film and good enough. I did not see this movie in the cinema, but I am happy that it made many people go to the cinema and see this movie. In the end, in this time with this movie everything is for the benefit of cinema.\n",

      "Barbie opens with an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning, artificial reality of Barbieland, where the sky is a painting and the food imagined. It's colorful, the set designers display fully realized artistic visions-it's nice to see a movie that isn't over sanitized for a mass audience, a movie that doesn't play it safe. You can see the influences Greta Gerwig wanted to include from old Hollywood all over the place. Margot Robbie is the star as Barbie, fully embodying the perfect Barbie life until cracks start to form in Barbieland.Barbie presents two dystopian worlds, one a bad version of the real world, and Barbieland, where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all. Ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power. It was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class. Ken is essential to the emotional core of the film. He's how we see the injustice of Barbieland. The movie isn't man-hating, it uses the poor treatment of the Kens by the Barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals, capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are.** Significant spoilers after this point**The movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from Gloria (thanks to America Ferrera's excellent performance) that we don't have to be perfect, we can embrace being ordinary. She doesn't want the perfect Barbie life either, she wants an ordinary Barbie that's also a mom, loves her family, and embraces her imperfections as good things. The concern with insecurity caused by Barbie is made less tactfully by Gloria's daughter who goes on a screed calling Barbie a fascist (you can't tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at Gen Z self righteousness).Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie also learns these values, shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful. Barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of Barbieland. This is why it's so important she leaves Barbieland at the end of the film, she rejects the reimposed female domination of Barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in Barbieland. Barbieland is not the good place.There were some significant negatives for me though. I thought the movie had some humor that fell very flat in parts. The scenes at Mattel didn't do much for me. The movie was at its weakest in the real world (where we spent a lot of time). Some of the characters had rushed development.I am Kenough.\n",

      "First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, \"How did this movie ever get made?\" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend. You've been warned.\n",

      "Barbie is a fun little movie that is, at its core, a satire on traditional gender roles in society. Thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom (if ever) lives up to our youthful expectations. Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can't see it that way. It's simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark \"realism\". Barbie doesn't do that. It reveals that it's a joke in the very first scene.Is this a great movie? Absolutely not. But it is fun, entertaining summertime fluff. Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both look and act perfectly plastic. The set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace. See it and enjoy.\n",

Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.\n",

Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie. I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.Ryan Gosling, he literally delivered his best. The soundtrack should have some more elements from 80s 90s as the storyline mostly based on these years of Barbie.Paying a tribute to Ruth was amazing but they should have also pay a tribute to the original Barbie, Bild Lilli...\n",

      "I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken.\n",

      "The real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this Friday. One was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema. The former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a man's world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics. To address the elephant in the room, \"Oppenheimer\" beats \"Barbie\" on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight, irrespective of what the box office figures might denote.That said, \"Barbie\" is a good film, a fun watch, that could have been so much more. The first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime. It was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant, colourful world without any trace of morbidity. The Barbie houses, the beach, the house of the Weird Barbie, the roads, the Netherlands-like fields, the sea - they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of, only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that Gerwig's vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow. To conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our Barbies. The Barbies come from all walks of life, hold important positions, and stay at the frontline of Barbie life - a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to Ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash. At the center of all these Barbies is Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety. She is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned, hence the stereotype about her. The Kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities. All was well until the real world began messing with the Barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death. Depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner. \"Barbie\" should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in. The last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done Ken song - one of my favourite moments from the film. Gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line. Gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision, for the world she has accomplished in this film, for the infinite ideas she has established - feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes. She has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression. If only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much better.\"Barbie\" packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project. Robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy, sadness, existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed. Issa Rae as President Barbie and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are two other standouts. But the real star of the show is Ryan Gosling - his Ken-ergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout. Just look at his incredible comedic chops when Ken visits the human world. You just can't have Ken-ough of Gosling's Ken. \"La La Land\" showed that he could dance really well, a skill he has put effectively to use in the Ken song too.In the end, Gerwig's film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena. It could have had a little more of the \"muchness\" (as the Mad Hatter would say in \"Alice in Wonderland\") in the fun department. It dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavy-handedness drags it down to an extent. Alas!\n",

      "This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are. It's a waste of time for anyone not watching the movie Ironically, go watch Oppenheimer instead.\n",

And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the \"Just Ken Exclusive\" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!! And don't forget that you can be whatever you want to be.By the way, I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand.\n",

      "Gosling Robbie Made the movie. They're what makes it worthy to Watch. Every other possible meaning or message the director was aiming to Explore in the film was pointless or superficially / weakly face. Mattel tried so hard to wash its image through out Barbie's redemption that it almost appears cringe. Will Ferrell in the Same Role as he was in Zoolander or so. Finally the male figure is a bad represantation of the worst and stereotypical patriarchy which you could assist to maybe in the 80s. Despite Goslin's brilliant represantation Ken is just a stupid mamma boy without any merit. Robbie is just wonderful.\n",

      "Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9/10.\n",

I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.Does NOT need a sequel or a Mattel cinematic universe! Lol.\n",

      "First, I'd like to clarify one thing: Barbie is not an \"Anti-Men\" or a \"Men-Hating\" Movie in any shape or form. Instead, it is a very thought-provoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as Identity, Self-discovery, Existentialism, Ethics, Feminism, Gender Roles, Consumerism, Materialism, Beauty and Body Image.Barbie feels like a satirical take on the real world, the world we live in.The opening scene of Barbie was very similar to the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Then we get introduced to the Barbieland, the most perfect, ideal world according to the Barbies. Everyone's happy, everyone's joyful, and cheerful, and most importantly everything is being run by the Barbies. EVERYTHING. Ken is just a supporting character. There won't be a Ken with Barbie.But then things start to change, Barbie talks about DEATH. Mind you, nobody dies in Barbieland, they get discontinued by MATTEL. Then Barbie embarks on a journey of self-discovery accompanied by Ken.One of my favorite scenes is when Barbie and Ken are in the real world and both of them get catcalled. The stark contrast between the reaction of both Barbie and Ken to the catcalling was portrayed very accurately.Ken learns about Patriarchy in the real world. Ken used to live in a world where everything is run by Barbie but in the real, it's literally the opposite. Ken takes all he has learned in the real world back to Barbieland and changes everything. He literally changes Barbieland to \"Kendom Land\".Meanwhile, Barbie is trying to find answers to why she doesn't feel perfect anymore or why she doesn't feel pretty anymore.We get a glimpse of the Mattel Corporation as well and how literally every working person is like a doll.There is this one monologue in the film which stands out. The monologue which helped Barbie get out of her Existential Crisis.The last 15-20 minutes of the film are perfect, the set designing, the dialogues, everything - it was perfect.If you are someone who loves great films and enjoys great storytelling, you'll love Barbie.Give it a chance and you'll not regret it.\n",

      "Me and my sister both enjoyed this film and disliked it. The beginning of the film starts off with little girls destroying baby dolls because the new \"barbie toy\" had been created. Me and my sister were shocked and also disappointed in the scene. The movie was really funny, it had us laughing a lot and we enjoyed it. They made men look absolutely stupid, as in if there was just one leadership position filled by a man it was the end of the world. That part annoyed us and we strongly disagreed w it. Overall, i think that the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst i've ever seen. I definitely enjoyed certain moments of watching the film, but definitely not every moment. I recommend this film for the barbie world experience. I think every actor/actress fulfilled the role they played.

      "This movie touches on complex themes the way the Truman show and West World were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial. Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a \"Barbie\" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It's easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There's a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.Set design and visual humor were awesome. Everyone played their role with a lot of heart. My soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well. It was just wonderfully entertaining.\n",

      "I watched the Barbie movie a few weeks after it came out, so I was expecting to experience all the emotions people raved about on Twitter. Overall I thought the movie was well-produced, but I think its marketing was misleading. Now, I know that this movie couldn't be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch; people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of Barbie, not a Barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original. With that being said, I think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to society's standards, etc is nothing we haven't heard before, which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this? Another question I have is why did Ken have a song? It didn't benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition.

Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this \"perfect\" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances.

But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both amazing, but the rest of the big ensemble is a mixed bag. This is mostly because of the writing. Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and \"self aware\". The third act slows the movie down, which is a shame as the first and second acts are very strong. However, when Barbie delivers it delivers. The set design are beautifully artificial.

      "The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig has had a hit or miss career. Her film Little Women was fairly entertaining, but I found her film Lady Bird to be completely obnoxious. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I enjoyed her in Wolf Of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, but really disliked I Tonya and Birds of Prey.Now comes Barbie, based on the long running series of dolls from Mattel. Now as a guy, I never played with Barbies prefering to play video games over dolls, however my sisters enjoyed playing them and that's the question about this film. Who is the target audience for this film? Because on one hand it looked like a film designed for sixty year old women who never got over playing with their dolls and on another hand, its advertising is aimed at little girls even though some of the material maybe offensive to a lot of families.The plotline, which is extremely thin, involves Barbie living the perfect life in Barbieland where Barbie dolls of all types live and where all the Kens hang out at the beach, Then all of a sudden Barbie escapes to the real world where she is treated like a dog really hammering home Greta Gerwig's misandry.I can see this film having a decent opening weekend but expect it to drop like a rock in the following weeks when people realize this film is really just a one trick pony. The pink sets look nice but the screenplay and the annoying script are definitely going to divide audiences and this film really doens't have mainstream appeal at all. Most of all Will Farrel as the CEO of Mattel is about as annoying as ever and the misanderyt stereotypes are about entertaining as watching paint dry.A one on a scale of 1-10. Save yourself the headache and see the much better Oppenheimer instead!\n",

      "Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!\n",

      "Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!\n",

      "Barbenheimer? Who is the winner? Actually, when I thought about it, their are two completely different movies. Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand. The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour. Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome! This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.\n",

      "I thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous, taking the Mickey out of the whole Barbie phenomenon that it is.Great colour and cinematography and I even laughed in some parts. Then something strange happened about half way through: it got all serious and made Ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured (which I agree to be true, but didn't fit where I thought this movie was going).Not quite sure who this movie was intended for, but I walked out disappointed. The males all ended up being either bad or stupid, or both. Not sure if this is a film that the great Will Ferrell can hold his head up high for as his role served very little purpose.The acting and cinematography saved it.\n",

The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.\n",

      "I enjoyed the creation of the Barbie world, the costumes, set design, and I think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant. The script, however, was not that solid.They were going for a direct, transparent, explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue, but it often had a hard time landing. Particularly at the beginning. Some things felt spoon-fed to the audience, as if they weren't going to understand the givens of Ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in Barbie Land. We visually understand it, but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessary.The pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times. You also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles, even though Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch. You're following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world. But it was exactly the most profound (which is fiiiine, it's a movie about a doll after-all, but if they were going for this pov they should've dug deeper, in my opinion).I love all the actors involved, and the work of Greta Gerwig and the work of Noah Baumbach. But this wasn't their best work.I would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion. You can still enjoy the world, the acting, and have a laugh here and there. Also, for people who have never taken a look at our binary, sexist, and patriarchal society, it could be eye opening. For my part, I often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others, particularly women, so I wanted more out of the argument of the movie. Deeper.\n",

The message was so convoluted that you didn't know what it was trying to say.WARNING: The movie is not like \"Enchanted\" where it's a fun romantic comedy. The movie is funny, but it is convoluted with allegory.Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie both are fantastic. American Ferrera also shines. Will Ferrell was meh.My biggest thing was wondering why they chose to make Mattel cartoon feeling while at the same time trying to portray the real world.

Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.\n",

I believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better, and this is below that. However it tells an important story, and is a somewhat fun and education movie. I would rate it 6.5-7/10. Even though it's a \"Barbie\" movie, kids under probably 13 wouldn't understand the movie well. The moral of the story isn't just Barbie's and their fun little world. It's somewhat serious, and kids would only see the Barbie part, and not understand the point of the movie.\n",

      "Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint!

      "With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.\n",

It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.\n",

      "It's impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a well-known brand.The movie addressed a range of great themes, skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytale-like presentation.-One of the key messages is when Barbie talks to Ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship. Exploring personal preferences and self-awareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership. Developing a strong self-relationship is a foundational step before building connections with others.-The movie also transforms the traditional Barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while Barbies serve them. This shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships, highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchy.-A particularly touching moment is Barbie creator's monologue. It resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of self-confidence and fear of taking control of their lives.-The film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models, leading to personal dissatisfaction. Barbie has been/still is an example of those models. However, if our real lives start being reflected into the doll, we will notice how miserable and depressing we all are.It's sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages.\n",

I was so incredibly touched.Margo's acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for Barbie.As well as Ryan. Perfect casting.I genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around me.This movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen, not only as the 'girl boss' and other outdated feminist catchphrases, but also as the depth we have, and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasn't as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be. Unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy..\n",

So whinging, so reliant on gender stereotypes and societal stereotypes, so busy sermonising, it achieves nothing. The reasoning behind the film's reasoning wouldn't stand up to two minutes of scrutiny. Who wrote this junk? Who directed it? Who signed it off?

The scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong. But, those scenes are funny, as is the rest of the film.

      "The first half is excellent, it starts with a 2001 Dawn of Man parody with Robbie as the original striped Barbie in place of the monolith, then shows us Barbieland. Barbie is overrun with morbid thoughts, so travels to the Real World with a stowaway Ken.At this point, it starts to lose its way - it gets bogged down in preaching against patriarchy - a word used so many times you could sip low-alcohol beer every time they say the word and be unconscious by the end.Characters give long monologues on how it's \"literally impossible to be a woman\", and the Barbies turn the Kens against each other bizarrely by using their sex appeal to evoke jealousy (is that really a feminist message?!).Whatever they were trying to say here, it doesn't come across well. It's preachy, on-the-nose, and too unbelievable to communicate a real message. Other films like Gone Girl with its Cool Girl monologue, or comedies like Bad Moms, make the point this movie seems to be trying to make much more effectively.Barbieland looks amazing, and the first sections there are fun (the whole patriarchy messaging was wisely cut out of the trailers). It would have been better to make this a Fool Triumphant story like Legally Blonde, where Stereotypical Barbie (as Robbie's Barbie is known) is seen as an airheaded bimbo in the real world yet proves herself.\n",

I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can.

On the other hand, miserable but thriving Kens' lives with various music was very comical and fun. Such a landscape and world-setting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social power.Meanwhile, the storyline is pretty straightforward. It is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world, cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans. So in that sense, there was no sequence of surprise as such. However, it was a movie with a good length of about 90 minutes, to casually enjoy watching with your family and friends!\n",

The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes. Anyone can enjoy this film.\n",

      "Walking into the theater I was expecting a silly, outrageous, fun contrast to the competing new release of \"Oppenheimer\", but instead I found much more. Not only did this movie have incredible humor, but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman. The light it brought to the deep connection to mother's and daughters...especially the moment shared between Margot Robbie and Ruth Handler, was nothing short of a tear-jerker. Not only that, but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable; from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls. I have seen some critics who hate magic, fun, and women, be quick to hate on the heavy speech America Ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet. Sure, it didn't fit the theme of Barbieland's perfect, pink atmosphere, but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie. Her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater I was in.I left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel. It spoke to me in ways that cheesy, \"relatable\", lazily anti-capitalist and cheap feminist media could never do. This movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself. I felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it I went through the hassle of making a damn IMDB account and writing an essay that wasn't required by a teacher or school project. I actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving Ken's of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie. It is beautiful and a must watch.\n",

      "Honestly I loved it. The colors were brilliant. The usage of popular artists and actors as really well done. All of the characters were brilliantly casted. The it was intriguing, and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences. I think because of this though, it just didn't hit as hard for me. The messages within the movie were quite profound, and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end. Good overall, stellar for younger audiences, and would 100% recommend to a younger child. Not my color palette, so it was a bit bright. Not riveting. Just good.\n",

      "Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.\n",

And it's not fair for anyone on either side.This film isn't just about feminism or female empowerment, it's about growing up and finding who you really are, and what is your actual purpose. Which is the hardest thing for anyone, including myself...Thank you Greta Gerwig and the crew!\n",

      "Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.\n",

I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype.

      "First, no actress on earth could have done this role other than Margot Robie. She's as if Barbie came to life (spoiler alert-she does). Margot is incredible in this. From the 2001 inspired opening (which had me laughing my head off) to when she's depressed and appears to be Barbie left behind by a little girl. The stiff legs, the arms, the way she rolls over-hysterical. The rest of the cast, especially America Ferrara, carry the story well and no one, no one is laughing at being in the movie. There are many, many Barbie related easter eggs, including one my wife pointed out to me: The interior of America's car is the same color as one of the original Barbie cars. The movie is fun without being preachy and if you pay attention-you may just learn something. One last thing, the great Dame Helen Mirren narrates! Go see it and have fun.\n",

Every single dialogue and scene was predictable and even the songs and humor fell flat most of the time. There was nothing much to do for actors as all are cartoonish.The social commentary had no subtelty and just tried to hit you hard with the messaging with no deep insight or thought put in.The set design in Barbieland is the only saving grace in this move and also the iconic opening score insipred by 2001 A Space Odyssey!Hats off to the marketing team for this movie, who made sure that everone was talking about it and sustained the interest.\n",

It felt like they were going on a story, especially one that would end up with big problems in the future. I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly.

This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie.

The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start.

The speech itself just felt odd and was a bit on the nose compared to the rest of the movie, but they managed to tie it all up at the end of the movie fairly nicely so I am willing to overlook that.

I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.Barbieland is shown as a happy monotonous human-like world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model, something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world.

They missed the main point.We have to remember that it is a satire and both the Barbie Land and Real World are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need. I think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more important.Also I support how at the end how they didn't just give the Kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment, in that fictional world the Barbies were more qualified (by design) to hold those positions and all the Kens have just been are side characters with no \"real\" talents other than being the eye candys to the Barbies. Upliftment on basis of gender and not merit/talent is never a sign of a healthy society . But from now onwards it will not be \"Barbie...and Ken\" but \"it's Barbie and it's Ken\". I think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world.3.5/5 + 0.5 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale.

But the entire plot of the story was all over the place, leaving me feeling little to no empathy for the characters, albeit Ken. Now Ryan Gosling MADE this movie. Though at times, I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be the antagonist or puppy dog we were supposed to sympathize with. What really got to me about this movie were the stereotypes, which just contradicted the entire message. Scenes that were meant to be moving fell flat. Characters had very little development.

      "Margot Robbie is the best possible choice to play Barbie and Ryan Gosling is terrific as Ken. It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie. If I had some complaints I think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall Barbie is a success. 8/10.\n",

However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.The story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy. While granted in this day and age, there's a limit to the level of guff one can take.A colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be.

      "I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I've needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn't sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end, after he became his normal self, it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again... like, I still don't wanna be rooting for this guy. Seeing people's response to him as a character after the movie had me confused. I understand, Ryan Gosling is so fine, but Ken is not your babygirl! He still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologized!!The plot with the real-world Mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me. It was funny, don't get me wrong, but it just kind of happened and I wasn't sure what to glean from it. At one point I found myself thinking, like, what happened to those guys?? And then they just kinda showed up at the end. I also know it was meant to be commentary on Mattel's predominantly male leadership, but... like, YOU are Mattel. You have a male CEO. Like thanks for addressing it, but you have no room to talk.I think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point could've been used to touch a bit more on body image issues, because that is a HUGE criticism of the Barbie brand. Like, okay. You had one token fat Barbie with an otherwise entirely straight-sized cast. But some of the jokes were just like \"pregnant people are weird 😂\" and they never entirely said \"hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens\"\n",
      "I think they *tried* to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across. I think it could've been pretty easy to incorporate a scene, like when Barbie tried tea for the first time, to be like wow! Indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral value!Despite my criticisms, I would say this movie is a must-watch. The points it makes are really important. And I actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe, which is rare for me with these types of films!More of a 7.5/10 than a 7, if I had to say.\n",

By the end I was moved to tears for Barbie AND Ken. It represented to me many issues of modern times and things I was confronted with in real life.

      "The film's marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world, but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers. Had I not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film, I would have been taken aback, expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventure.Instead, \"Barbie\" turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society. While the central idea is commendable, the execution fell somewhat short for me. The plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed, and I could foresee the unfolding events and the movie's conclusion.Undoubtedly, the movie's core message is strong, but I couldn't fully embrace its realization. I agree with the critics' observations regarding the one-dimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending, despite the intentions.Still, \"Barbie\" has several strengths. The visual style is captivating, and the beauty of Barbieland is truly enchanting. In addition, the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characters.On the downside, some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior, which detracts from the overall balance. Also, the treatment of the Kens raised some concerns and left room for improvement.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" tackles an important and relevant issue, but it could have been executed more effectively. Despite its shortcomings, the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances.\n",

There are not enough extras in the real world scenes to make it look normal. I understand the filmmakers were attempting to make a statement about women's rights, etc., but it is done is such a heavy handed manner that it comes off as very forced. The costume & production design plus the glitzy choreographed numbers are not enough to make up for the missing substance of Barbie's need to figure out why her life feels wrong. The scene with the ghost felt like something stolen from the Matrix where Neo visits the oracle in the kitchen. This movie was overhyped & got us all to take the bait to see it & it made a billion $. I feel taken and bewildered that anyone enjoyed this - the movie felt very disturbing to me in a way I can't articulate.\n",

      "Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.\n",

      "Haters can hate all they want. It's a brilliant movie. I could not have asked for anything more. In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken.\n",

      "Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.\n",

      "I would not recommend this movie. Nothing happened really. It felt like a very long commercial for Mattel with all the different Barbie's you can buy. And it wasn't even a fun commercial. It had no meaning at all. The one thing that had meaning was the speech of Gloria (America Ferrera) about how women will never be enough ever because they're a woman. If I'd heard that as a little girl I would've thought what's the point in trying to change it, but I'm a grown woman and I know how far we've come already. And that was about 2 minutes of the 2 hours. I never laughed but cringed a few times. I think it could've had great potential but it just didn't get it. The actors were maybe right but the story wasn't there. I also didn't get the weird play of Will Ferrell. Why was the Mattel CEO so weird? Did I miss something? I did not like this movie and would like to get my 2 hours back please.\n",

This is the definition of Gen Z movie , very up to date and very relatable to this generation. Very Easy to understand , you'll need a coffee to keep you wide awake if you're very critical to the movies . Ryan Gosling is absolutely a bait to the movie .

I watched the movie in the theater with good speakers, so the floor was shaking during the end roll because of the bass. What is this, here is a club?I thought afterwards that it's like. Greta Celeste Garwig, who has been (seemingly) straight point so far, is suddenly swinging a nail-bat in many directions, and that's part of the fun.It's a good movie to give a stir in this world(especially in Japan).Warner needs to reflect.\n",

      "I found this film to be disappointing and and an overall letdown, to say the least.The humour, acting, soundtrack, casting & costumes were AMAZING. Don't get me started on the dance choreography and the sets. I found that those aspects really created an amazing atmosphere for what the perfect Barbie world is was intended to be. Michael Cera was absolutely hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing at the broken barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.Nevertheless, although it was clear they were trying to exaggerate the message on purpose, I found the plot to be just.. stupid. Barbie fights the patriarchy, or, Ken on a horse. I found the humour during multiple points in the movie to be dry, especially stressing how much Ken loves horses.The ending, I found to be mushy. I was expecting something better, and just kind of felt let down. Almost like it was lazy.In conclusion, I'd give this movie a solid six out of ten. It's kind of sad, as I am the targeted audience for this film- a young, feminist, progressive woman. Don't get me wrong, this movie was great at parts- but, in the end, was definitely overhyped.\n",

      "It was a literal cinematic master piece. It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.It touches upon feminism, misogyny, patriarchy, women's relationship with themselves.It showed a utopia run by women, Barbie land wasn't perfect, the kens were ignored but not hated, undervalued but not sexualized.In a world meant to mirror patriarchy, we saw a difference in treatment that really opened people's eyes.It also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men, it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have, it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of time.The hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as \"hate\" when it couldn't be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the most.The best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh, cry and wake up mentally, together.Overall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity, forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a BETTER world not just for women but for men as well.This film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society. Fantastic film.\n",

      "The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of \"patriarchy is bad\" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste.\n",

      "At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.\n",

The plot and message are annoying though. Starts from the beginning with a very delusional message, and does not let up. Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie.\n",

      "The Barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable. The costumes and sets were great and added to the Barbie nostalgia. Ken was probably my favorite part, watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love, and finally finding himself outside of Barbie at the end of the movie. I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down.\n",

What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected.

      "Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.The plot was rather textbook, but definitely enjoyed the witty subtle jokes which created good tension and suspension. Well-balanced and great character development for most characters except for Sasha who changed opinions just too quickly for my taste.\n",

      "As far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was simply boring to me, and the attempts at humor on that level were just UGH. Yes, the message is fine, though very simplified - men bad, women good. I agree that equality is important, and I liked the conclusion that Kens need to find their own purpose. Of course, I didn't miss the gay undertones with the Kens (flexing on the beach with beers and the Grease-like choreography where a black and yellow Ken give Gosling kisses on the cheeks and then shake it off with a \"what was that\" - I'd gladly pay a ticket for that action 😜), and there's also a gay vibe with Allan and the cubicle guy from Mattel... I also liked Weird Barbie and Ruth. The Mattel board was a very coarse caricature to me.All in all, a \"mixed bag\" - there are good moments, but the bad ones outweigh them for me. I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't do it again.It's symptomatic to me that an Oppenheimer barely collects 650 million, and these guys double that, and it'll probably be even more...\n",

I was really looking forward to watching this with my daughter, well the whole family really, but my daughter especially, and she hated the movie. The whole family did.

      "First of all, I really loved this movie. I think it's fun and entertaining and I really think it's done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn't help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It's a very colorful movie and it's so refreshing to see that, specially with all the \"gray\" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it's filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.However this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasn't for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the movie.First of all, the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this part.The scene where a man simply smacks Barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were Barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop (that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings). More so, the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and I really didn't like them coming to the Barbie world. The \"deprogramming all the barbies\" was too forced for me and I would prefer if Barbie herself did that.Which leads me to the final part, the politics.After seeing the real world 'patriarchy\", Ken, a character that lived his whole life just to please Barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her, finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that. Is he right? No, of course not. But I think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment. And, for me, the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end. But it didn't. I mean, it did a little bit, but not enough in my opinion. It would have been awesome if the Barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them. But instead they chose to make a joke that \"the Kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world...\" It really missed the point of making Barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world, one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and women.Anyway, this my review of the movie and in conclusion: Close Kenough to a perfect movie.\n",

But that was probably it. Clearly Mattel wanted to improve the opinion of Barbie dolls based on feminist themes and the problem of gender inequality. However, there is a strong feeling that this topic was used as a marketing manipulation. Good cast and acting, film for both children and adults. Lots of references to barbie doll jokes. Margot Robbie played really great here, without her this movie would be much weaker.If you go to the cinema, you will probably be satisfied, but if you don't go, you won't lose anything.

I didn't feel anyone had any natural chemistry, and the acting didn't land for me. I came in with a very open mind for this film, and I loved Barbie growing up, but my main issue was that it wasn't funny. I was so bored watching this and almost fell asleep a few times.

      "The film is an enchanting mixture of sitcom, satire on consumer society and philosophy, where they dragged in everything they possibly could: from Pinocchio to the Bible. At the same time, the movie seems like a sketch from a talkshow that parodies cliches associated with the Barbie subculture.All the most important things happen towards the end, when Barbie faces a dilemma on a universal scale: to remain a doll in an ideal doll world or to become a real (\"ordinary\") person. There is no single correct choice here. You either live in a delusional bliss or face the harsh reality.In general, the impression of the film can be expressed in a phrase: they wanted to say a lot of things at once, but along the way they also got lost in their grandiose attempt at philosophy. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be funny. Adults will enjoy reading the philosophical ideas hidden here. And for children there is a bright, dynamic story and several smart ideas presented in understandable language.\n",

For example, why did the Mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the Ken's brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time. Also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long.

Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact.

      "This had a great concept but utterly failed, couldn't understand why Barbie had to just be so mean to Ken. First part was good then just went downhill from there. We kept thinking when is this going to end. We laughed so hard over the movie being so pointless and the sheer stupidity of the storyline. The only best part was when Barbie told the old lady she was beautiful and of Ryan Gosling singing. I loved Barbies but not this way. Margot Robbie is a great actress and I have loved all her movies and she was a great Barbie, and I loved her emotions in the movie but the part was not scripted well for her. They made a fool of her and Ryan Gosling. The writers could have done so much more for these great actors in this movie.\n",

      "The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.\n",

      "Hilarious, fun, poignant, smart, and satirical. As a middle-aged mother of 4, I related to Gloria SO MUCH. And I cried. Boy did I cry. Much like Everyone Everywhere All At Once, I felt SEEN. For all the critics of the movie, my response is, 1. (Quoting Jack Nicholson) YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, and 2. ITS SATIRE, FOLKS! But like most satire, it flies over the heads of many. Many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way, but others are subtle. Not going because you don't want to support what you've heard is a political \"side\", well, that's just ridiculous. Give yourself more credit than that.\n",

      "This movie has an absurdist quality about it that I can't really explain, almost like early 2000's Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander or Tropic Thunder, that makes you feel as if you hallucinated the whole thing. In that regard, another comparison is Monty Python's flying circus and the sort of delightful wittiness of the show.Barbie is profoundly silly and strange and an extremely high effort production, reflected in the spectacular set design. Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for the role so much that he steals the show. The result is that Barbie is almost completely unlike anything else you would see at the cinemas.I don' t think the film is perfect or anything, the ending, for me, felt a bit unsatisfying for Ken, at least, and the film also contains a car commercial, for some reason. At the end of the day, even if you disagree or have problems with the feminist argument that the film makes, the film will have you smiling like an idiot most of the time in a way that not many other pieces of media can.\n",

      "I loved the set design, acting and personal development of the characters, the nuance and meaning, but didn't like the rushed storyline. Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue \"beach\", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn't do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.I thought that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling played their characters perfectly, capturing their characters development and different nuances. You could definitely see Barbies transformation into a human, but Margot did a good job at keeping Barbie at her core even in human form.Some of my favorite storylines included the war of the Kens, the discovery of patriarchy, the brainwashing of the Barbies, and the takeover of the Barbies - again.However, the switch to the real world and back felt rushed, as well as the relationship development between Sasha and Gloria, and Barbie. Really what should have happened was a two part movie, to fully tell the story, or a 3 hour movie. I also felt they spent too much time in Barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting bored.For example, Sasha and Gloria meet Barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to Barbie world. I felt like Barbie should have had to work to make them believe her, making the discovery of Barbie world by Sasha and Gloria even sweeter, and Barbie's transformation into human even more complex. I wish I got to see her learn more about becoming human. I absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end, but felt that could have been earlier in the movie, with the scene with Ruth at the end.I couldn't discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious, with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism. It could have easily been both if there was more time spent on Barbie's transformation to human. Maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to Barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to Barbie.\n",

      "The social commentary was pretty heavy-handed. Albeit, this is to be expected in the Barbie movie. However, it was genuinely funny. A lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm. There were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once. Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this. I appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism. In one the of the final scenes, the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is.\n",

I feel like by the time I went to see the movie there were no surprises left.Watch the movie for the message but don't go in with super high expectations like I did.I believe that it's not worth it to watch in theatres.

      "Funny thing to say about a Barbie movie, means I had my hopes too up, but it's more about who directed it, I think she's pretty good.What worked for me was the barbie world, and Margot and especially Ryan were great. Every scene with Ryan was great, he's got great comedic timing.What didn't work was the real world. The real people are supposed to come and teach the dolls what real life is like, but they do it with the most cliche, cringiest dialogue (I would call it womansplaining honestly, stuff that will make everyone cringe in like 10 years - but hey, it's a Barbie movie in 2023, what can you expect).The issue really is that the real people (the mother and daughter and the Mattel people and even people on the streets) were just not believable as real people. So if you're not going to show believable characters, you may as well just show me the dolls and remove the real world all together.Overall pretty funny, worth a watch, but it has much less depth than I imagined from the trailers. In the end it's just a huge product placement, when it could've been more. But hey, just imagine how them profits will skyrocket.\n",

      "Barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects, from its comedic moments to its unique charm. The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.Where the story loses points is in its confusing message. While the film clearly aims to promote gender equality, the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative. It wasn't so much the fact that the pep talks were about women, but rather the way they were integrated into the story. I want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism. As a woman myself, I appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtly.I found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film, such as Alan and several of the Barbies/Kens, lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes. Additionally, I would have liked to see more exploration of Barbie Land and its unique characteristics. On a positive note, the message about the transient nature of one's life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting.\n",

      "Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.\n",

The story was weird, the acting was a bit off, not very many characters were likable and it was also very weird seeing Ryan Gosling sing a song in this movie and he's not even that very good of a singer. I don't think this movie should even be nominated for an Oscar for best picture. It's probably likely that it will be nominated for a Razzie for most cringe movie ever. The ending wasn't that great either. Sure we got to meet Barbies creator, but it still wasn't very good. 3 out of 10 for this.\n",

With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however.

      "Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken's as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.But just like everyone has been talking about, I'd like to talk about the \"message\" this movie is pushing. I overall didn't feel like they were straight \"man hating\", but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didn't take away from the overall experience for me. The part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic a-hole was a bit much for me, I am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit. Imagine you take your young daughter to see this, it's gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing up.The Characters of America Ferrera's daughter and the Mattel higher up's were absolutely worthless to the plot. I mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b**** to Barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the \"diversion/twist\" that her mom is the one that needed Barbie's help.My main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending. Ken comes back from Earth with \"Patriarchal\" ideals and takes over Barbie land and I honestly couldn't tell if they were supposed to be the so on \"villains\" of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie. Because I never really felt like they were bad guys, Ken was treated like crap by Barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him. The end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast. It's like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull women's emotional strings.PSA: This is not a kids movie, definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women. Most of the humor in it is adult level humor.But overall I came into this movie thinking I would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it.\n",

Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.\n",

      "I'm only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you're a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.In fact if you are a fan of Barbie I suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experience.However, for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men, I would like to ask if you watched the same movie? Neither men nor women were the target in this movie. This movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general. It is established quite early on that the Barbie's and Kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance. As soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened, that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved. Even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out (usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland), they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie, that is, aside from the inclusion of \"ordinary people\" by Mattels introduction of \"Ordinary Barbie\", which seems to serve as further evidence of Mattel claiming self awareness (hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film) and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making Barbie in the first place. Finally Barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real, Mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of Mattel - an old woman. (honestly ladies, this is your real enemy in life lol. Men are pretty useless as depicted, old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress you)The movie however seemed to say these things through mockery:\n",
      "1- if you treat men like the Barbies treat the Kens, you will become one option of many, as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends.2 - When your old (like Barbie) you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina. HOWEVER even though Ken is old (and unbelievably dumb and useless) he still gets to live in Barby Dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful Barby's which just seems to reinforce the supposedly \"patriarchal\" concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women.3 - If you're young and pretty (for women) or just pretty (for men), you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with \"real problems\".4 - There in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality, as long as your good enough, you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in reality.That being said, the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old, being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie. Aside from America Ferrara. We do not like her as an audience lol. Superstore proved this. Her patronizing speech is an insult to women's intellects and the low point of the movie. Gosling's accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight. (I dont understand why men are upset by this, how Gosling was portrayed in this movie is exactly how I have seen him my entire life lol..).I'd rate Barby as Sublime.\n",

However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline.

Calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool. The writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times. Its not \"dark, weird, and crazy\" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.I really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a woman-run government. I get what they're doing. I get its not a real place. But then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts, when four women sit on the supreme court today. Joke about them just not being able to be president or something if you want it to hit home.I think when people call this movie \"preachy\" theyre mostly talking about America Ferrera's speech.

Yes we know there are high standards for beauty.The second half of the film becomes a mess, with the meaning that they'd set up in the first part of the film falling apart.

      "Barbie is Gerwig-Lite: just far too self-aware for its own good, to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics. Gerwig and Baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience, \"Hey, we're aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but we're still having fun!\" Which, fine, but Gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to; political astuteness doesn't make for very entertaining or memorable film dialogue.Also, I long for the (often hinted-at) version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly (although I guess the ending sort of posits it as \"not for everyone\" but again, you see my point as to how overwritten this is). The production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe, the soundtrack is rife with bland focus-group pop, and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all Hollywood movies post-COVID seem to have. (I suppose \"plastic\" is appropriate for a movie about America's favorite doll, but I watched some of The Thin Red Line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans were able to make beautiful-looking movies). It's indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyone's said it is, but it could have been so much more.Major points deducted for uncalled-for digs at Pavement and The Godfather (plenty of women love both!!)\n",

      "The movie started out fun and strong. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent, set design superb, etc. However, the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better direction.What I liked: It emphasized how with Barbie/dolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything. Unfortunately, in the real world, patriarchy exists and we're limited. I liked it didn't marry Barbie off to Ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happy.What I didn't like: The stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in Barbie land. That things got confusing and hard to follow. Why exactly were all Barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical Barbie?I wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the Kens and the Barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs. Maybe Ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over Barbies dream house. He gets acknowledged and gets his space too. Maybe he hooks up with Midge because he moves on. Maybe he gets a beach house so he can Beach off whenever he wants. I don't know. It was funny. I laughed out loud several times. Glad I saw it. Just wish they went some different directions.\n",

      "I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.\n",

      "Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell \"the message\". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.\n",

      "Most movie buffs have hated modern trailers for quite some time now. It's annoying that it often has to contain such an epic version of an existing pop song, but the worst thing is that they often show the entire film in short - and then also exactly as it goes in the film. The creators of Barbie understood that the first half hour contains enough material to use only its footage to capture the audience's interest. What follows next is a wonderful surprise.Barbie is a mirror to a major problem in society that many people don't even see in its entirety because it's so deeply ingrained.Thanks.\n",

      "I was deciding on a movie to watch when eventually I decided on the barbie movie because why not, I went in thinking this would be a childish type movie but I was actually quite surprised to say the least. I can see where people are coming from with all the negativity but I personally did not mind it! The camerawork was pretty good, the acting was good though it can get cheesy at certain times, the story wasn't bad but it wasn't perfect or amazing. But the best thing about the movie is how fun it is, you can sit down after school, work, stressful or busy day and you just lay back and have a good time! I do recommend it to people who want a fun experience. Although if your looking for a serious, action filled, 10 star movie, this is probably not for you.\n",

      "I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you. Make sure you wear pink ;)We would see it again and again!\n",

      "It's a fine, fun movie but will never be a classic one like 2001- or Matrix that makes you want to watch it repeatedly IMO. But definitely not a bad one.I'd like to share my perspective on the end part that seems leaving some ppl confused. Even after showing all the difficulties, obstacles, and overcome between the two sexes, the only thing that matters is that we can procreate as humans otherwise all the messages, homages, jokes, history, and thoughts shared in the film will become meaningless without human existence. I don't know much about the director but even if she is a truly thoughtful feminist or not, the challenge of sublimating all the human themes to the simplest message at the ending scene should be evaluated properly.As it went a bit dull and cliche-like throughout the film, It really looked like Barbie(Barbara) was going to have a job interview or something in that scene so was a nice unexpected ending blow to me. Yes, she seemed happy being pregnant(at least she didn't look like she had an STD to me) and it concludes the story neatly.\n",

      "Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again.\n",

It was fun and absurdist but also profound.The depth in the movie is the perfect level - it doesn't go too far and still feels fun and playful but still does deep explorations. It's also just really funny and clever and campy in the best way.I loved the costuming, the set design, the cinematography and the acting.

      "This movie is not completely worthless like I was expecting it to be when I saw the trailer. There are some good comedic bits in this movie, and the acting is fairly good. There is also a lot more substance to this film than I was expecting, this movie really is geared towards adults rather than kids.I appreciate the movie touching on some interesting topics. Like the impact that Barbie has had on body image, her impact on gender roles, and the unhealthy obsession with material items. It is certainly a bold move by the director, one that could have been executed better. At times the delivery of the messaging feels too clunky, including a Shakespearean monologue from America Ferrera. This is also a movie that doesn't seem to want to end. The final 15 minutes drag with an inefficient wrap up sequence.\n",

But it clearly isn't deserving that 7+ from me that it has now (in my opinion). The beginning is so strong but towards the end it's getting more disappointing. Great acting, great visuals/colors but sadly a very bad story. And yes the end is nicely done. But overall.. Not so great.

      "The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song.

      "If you're making brand films, each of his directors reveals his own vision, and that vision generally lacks some points. However, I think Greta Gerwig knew all aspects of Barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly. Margot Robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes. In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house. I wouldn't say that I played badly, but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion.\n",

      "I went to see this knowing nothing and exspecting nothing. I was confused with the reference to 1001 Space Odyssey at the beginning but was thrilled with our introduction to the Barbie World. It was a feast for the eyes and a blast from the past. It brought back my childhood make believe adventures with the dolls. Margot Robbie was perfect casting for Barbie. She believably naive without being stupid. I was laughing out loud. I was thrilled with the music and dance numbers. Ryan Gosling's Ken was also adorable. It's when they enter \"the real world\" that things go terribly wrong. Every character outside Barbieland is portrayed in a juvenile manner that made it hard to watch. Then the story just fell apart. It reminded me of a bad SNL sketch where the writers had a great idea but didn't know how to land the punch line or end the skit. I really felt that having the Barbies manipulate the men into going to war to regain control of Barbieland reeked of misogyny. If this had been a play I would have walked out at intermission. I'm really shocked that Mattel let their named be used. If this movie had just stayed in Barbieland and explored more of how the dolls \"live\" I would have given this a 10.\n",

      "Got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, \"Barbie,\" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.\n",

The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard.

I think it's been 30 years since I walked out of a movie theater because the movie was so, so bad. I don't know how it's been so successful. Marketing at its best (or worst). It's boring, disjointed, and sexist (to both men and women). It's an unwatchable mess, and by the last 20 minutes we cared so little about the characters, that we just left. It's horrendous.

And the problems that Barbie experiences the second day are part of life and we know that world isn't perfect and we all deal with it in our own way whether in flats or heels. And same goes for Kens, there is no need for stereotypes, just be Kenough.Living in 21st century is challenging for all, but let's take everybody's heads out of their a*ses and enjoy this ridiculousness that is happening all around shown on screen.The most spectacular part of it all is the art direction and attention to detail that brought so many easter eggs.\n",

      "\"Barbie,\" the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of Barbie's objectification, falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. While the film's attempt to address social issues and promote self-confidence among girls is commendable, its approach feels one-sided and counterproductive.On the positive side, \"Barbie\" does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively. The movie's soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy, helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes. Bilie Eilish's song, \"What was i made for\" sang by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling performance in \"I'm just Ken\" are the standouts.Unfortunately, the film takes a heavy-handed approach in addressing gender issues. Instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding, \"Barbie\" seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy. Such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progress.The portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush. By portraying all male characters as either stupid, childish, immature, or disrespectful towards women, the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes, alienating a significant portion of its potential audience, including male viewers and responsible male role models.Additionally, the excessive focus on harassment, groping, and dirty looks that Barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movie's message. Instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics, it leans heavily on extreme examples, potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address.\n",

It's like the world is doing exactly what the Barbie movie tells is happening. There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is \"Pitting men against women\" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, \"And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world\", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people's eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today.\n",

Paroles, paroles, paroles, that's what Barbie's all about. Actually everything in this movie sounds old, tired and stale. People Will Talk (1951) still sounds fresh comparing to this. Or Kiss and Make Up (1934) that also deals with male-female relationships and beauty standards.Some of the films about empowerment and diversity that beat Barbie on every possible level are: The Iron Jawed Angels (2004), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Boys Don't Cry (1999), Amelia (2009), Amélie (2001), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), The Heiress (1949), Mildred Pierce (1945), Kitty Foyle (1940), Ninotchka (1939), 9 to 5 (1980), Working Girl (1988), Precious (2009), The Color Purple (1985), Hairspray (1988), My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), The First Wives Club (1997), Alien (1979), Halloween (1978), Trading Places (1988) and the list goes on. Hilary Swank is in four of them, so give that girl an extra cookie! Also, all of Katharine Hepburn, Glenda Jackson, Bettie Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Mae West, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford films exude empowerment. You don't have to figure it out, it will simply posses you.The visuals in Barbie seem AI. I'm not a fan of digital effects so maybe that's why I wasn't impress. I grew up watching Classic Hollywood musicals. The choreography, the dancing & singing skills, the costumes and all of that in Technicolor or in beautiful black and white was so much more effective than this. All That Jazz (1979), American in Paris (1951), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), The Red Shoes (1948), Lady in the Dark (1944), all of Fred & Ginger films and those choreographed by Busby Berkeley are far more spectacular and better produced than Barbie.The characters are not sympathetic to me and the cathartic moment in the film when Barbie achieves her humanity by discarding Ken is also the moment when I don't care what she does. The movie has already been too long, there has already been a lot of senseless running around, in and out of Barbieland, like watching too many episodes of the latest Turkish soap opera with your mum, the drama, the subversion, the subversion of the subversion, the flat feet, the cellulite, the arrest, the chase with the men in black, the meeting with your maker... I wouldn't care if the two of them ended up going on a holiday with Slavoj Zizek. Though, that would be something. So, in conclusion, if you want to see a heartwarming movie about a doll that becomes human, I recommend Pinocchio (1940).\n",

      "I was excited to see what this movie would delve into, and it being from a woman's point of view sounded promising. I was expecting a fun, slightly superfluous film, but safe to say, it was so much more than that.The first thing I'd like to point out is the meticulous outfit designing, it perfectly encapsulates the energy of Barbie, but with a modern touch.The dreamhouse was designed with attention to even the tiniest details.I loved how a lot of elements of the movie were portrayed from the viewpoint of a little girl - The lack of water in Barbieland, Barbie \"flying\" to her car, and the 'world' map.The movie just kept getting more and more enthralling. The exploration of the patriarchy in the 'real' world is eerily accurate. The raw, unadulterated expression of the dilemmas of womanhood is one which speaks for women and girls all around the world.I appreciate how the movie concluded with not the return of the matriarchal Barbieland, but an effort to strive for equilibrium, which acknowledges the sentiments of both men and women, which is a progressive message to carry out.Handler's dissertation on the immortality of ideas, and essence of humanity was quite profound.The acting, everyone's, was entertaining and impeccable, without it , the movie could never be just as good.The soundtrack, while song-oriented, was still effective at projecting the vibe and aesthetic of the movie into one's ears.Overall, this movie is more than just \"glitter and sparkles\", it symbolically confronts the facets of our society. It is truly a film, anyone,\n",

      "The most unpleasant and disappointing film that has come out recently! To be honest, I was waiting for this movie! Because of Gosling and Robbie! I waited in vain. Boring plot, bad music (there's not even Aqua's \"Barbie Girl\" song), poor acting and general atmosphere of the film. And even though it is the highest-grossing film of the year, I didn't like it, like many others. Oppenheimer turned out to be much better, and thanks to him for that! I do not recommend this film under any circumstances. Never. Watch only good movies and don't waste time on mediocre film projects. Good luck to all! Bye!\n",

      "Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.\n",

I was the generation that started with Barbie so I thought it was very entertaining and more importantly I thought the costumes were totally spot on for the Barbie character as well as the Ken character.It kinda remind me of the Flintstone movie I saw years ago, but the designs were great and the costuming was great and the hall simplicity of Barbie and her Barbie village vibe was great.I'm not going go into any more details, but I would say that I would watch it again because it was an entertaining, and Ken was great, as well as Will Ferrell as the chairman of Mattel, and then Rhea Perlman being the maker of Barbie.Watch it!

      "I'm a childfree woman that works in tech (male dominated environments), and I did not like this movie.The first third of the movie was awesome! I loved seeing girls destroying their baby dolls and replacing with Barbie. As a childfree woman I was so excited!The movie could have spent time exploring Barbie Dreamland, or time showing Barbie and Ken reacting to stuff in the real world... instead they:1) Delivered rants about \"the patriarchy\", the movie was preachy and for what? Anyone at the Barbie movie is already open minded enough to go see this movie2) Made it about \"men vs women\" rather than equality. A lot of issues women face due to social expectations affect men too, and feminism isn't about a matriarchy it's about equality3) It wanted to deliver social commentary while being lazy. Even Ken says \"I thought the patriarchy was about horses\" If a movie wants to address social issues using terms as buzz words isn't enough. They could have explored how the patriarchy affects both genders, but this movie imo just wanted to virtue signal4) They got a diverse cast, yet only the white actors had depth5) At the end of the movie Barbie has visions of moms and daughters as the reason it's worth being human. A complete opposite message to the girls destroying their baby dolls at the beginning of the movieI went into Barbie hoping for a ridiculous movie, not a movie about \"how tough it is to be a woman\"10/10 to the marketing team, though. They made me think this movie would be fun.\n",

      "\"Barbie\" should be the only movie I can give 10/10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let's hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie.\n",

To those people who say it hates on men, etc: you obviously didn't pay attention.

Whilst it was watchable and had it's humerous moments, we somehow expected more from it. It's very much in the mould of a Hollywood film with lots of obvious cliches. There were quite a few teenage girls in the cinema with their mothers, which could be the ones who enjoy this film the most. It's been described as a 'fun' film by many, which I can understand. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their parts well and add to the charm of the film.

However, the later half of the movie after Barbieland is not as good as the first half. The story becomes less interesting and the characters are not as well developed. The cinematography is still great but the plot becomes predictable and less engaging. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Barbie and wants to see a fun and entertaining movie.

Barbie and the Barbie/universe did a good job of making fun of itself, I recognized so many Barbies that I used to play with as a little girl, and I felt the feeling over again watching this movie that one gets when they start to grow up and grow out of playing with their Barbies.

Barbie is a very well crafted and enjoyable film. The movie has a lot of heart and soul with also having funny moments. Margot Robbie was a perfect casting decision for this movie and Director Greta Gerwig knows exactly what type a film she was making. The movie is very colorful when they are showing Barbie world and then it switches to a more dull/realistic color when in the real world. Ryan Gosling as Ken was another perfect casting choice and I feel brought his A game when it came to comedic segments. You don't have to be into the Barbie dolls to enjoy this film. I will say this movie is more geared toward adults rather then young people because of the themes they deal with. You will know what I'm talking about when you see the film. Barbie will stand the test of time and I'm sure will be a classic a few years from now. Barbie gets a near perfect 9 stars out of 10 from me.\n",

      "2023's 'Barbie' from writer/director Greta Gerwig has blown expectations out of the water, and not only become the highest grossing film of the year, but has captured the zeitgeist to become a veritable cultural phenomenon. The film is a fantasy comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling with significant supporting roles going to America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell. The movie is co-written by Gerwig's partner Noah Baumbach. There have been more than a few animated 'Barbie' films, but this is her first foray into live action. As August 2023 comes to an end 'Barbie' has set box office records becoming the highest grossing film of the year, the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman and is in the top twenty highest grossing films of all time.Robbie stars as Barbie (technically Stereotypical Barbie) and Gosling is Ken most commonly referenced as Beach Ken. They reside in Barbieland which is a matriarchal utopia where many variations of Barbies and Kens reside in perfect happiness along with a few odd, discontinued Barbie models. These real life dolls are under the impression that life in the real world reflects their happy, unencumbered existence in Barbieland thanks, not in small part, to their very existence and the example they set. Out of the blue Barbie begins having odd feelings of morbidity, and her perfectness is deteriorating. It is determined that her malaise is a reflection of the child playing with her in the real world, and she must journey there and set things aright if she is to get her perfect Barbie groove back. Ken joins her and together they venture to the real world which is not the carefree paradise they believed. Along with that Barbie and Ken discover the nature of the real world patriarchy which Ken attempts to bring back to Barbieland threatening its very existence. It becomes Barbie's mission to not only save the girl who has her doll in the real world, but also restore Barbieland from the lunacy of the Kens' burgeoning patriarchy.When I first heard 'Barbie' was being adapted I was more than a bit skeptical. I was intrigued after learning Gerwig and Baumbach were attached as they are at the forefront of some of the more intelligent film making coming out of Hollywood these days. Still how exactly would 'Barbie play? This could be a silly film that turns into a financial disaster. Instead it walked a hyper intelligent line of silly comedy mixed with incisive social satire and feminist messaging. It doesn't do it in a way that talks down to or belittles men though which is also key to an overall success. It taps a similar vein that 'Black Panther' tapped a few years ago for the black community. Here though it taps the often under served female portion of our population. From the opening scene that is a pantomime of the famous '2001: A Space Odyssey\" opening it is clear that this is a film maker in control of her craft and the story she is about to embark on. Especially in this day and age a very blatant feminist core message might not sell, but it does its task in such a fun and subversive way encased in a bright, candy coated shell with catchy music that it is hard not to get on board. If there is any misunderstanding though the message certainly becomes clear in the epic diatribe that is delivered by America Ferrera as Gloria on what it is like and the expectation placed upon being a woman in our modern society. 'Barbie' does an excellent job of dissecting the seeming dichotomy of Barbie itself. That is on one hand the dolls are meant to be empowering for women as the myriad of different Barbies come with different careers and different skin tones, and are meant to show young girls that they can be anything. On the other hand Barbie has become a negative stereotype for a perfect, unattainable idea of womanhood that contributes to many normal girls feeling inadequate in themselves for a myriad of reasons. It has hilarious and pointed commentary on the nature of the patriarchy as Gosling's Ken put the concept in place in Barbieland to both hilarious and appalling effect. About the only thing that didn't work for me in the story is the Mattel board of directors. They are yet another example of the real world patriarchy headed by Ferrell's character. The problem is that the real world is set up as, more or less, a realistic depiction of life in direct counterpoint to the fantasy world that is Barbieland. The exception to that appears to be Mattel and its board of directors which skew towards slapstick lunacy and seem out of place in the primarily real world setting. That aside 'Barbie' is fun and insightful. I think it is clearly targeted toward women and girls especially those with 'Barbie' experience, but it clearly becomes about women as whole. Along with that it is accessible to men who go in with an open mind, and realize that even as the struggle for equality and self fulfillment has come a long way since 1959 that road continues on and does not dead end in the present.\n",

      "Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a very interesting watch for a person like me. I'm the type of guy this movie makes fun of in it's two-hour runtime (I enjoy Zack Snyder's Justice League and The Godfather), and it certainly was a weird experience. So, yes, Barbie obviously isn't for me, but I'm going to do my best to give my actual complaints about the film without making it sound like I'm butthurt about its jokes about the patriarchy.First of all: it gets far too preachy. Gerwig could've kept the message of feminism in Barbie, but she could've made it so much subtler than it is. There are constant speeches about feminism and patriarchy. I mean, it gets crammed down your throat about every fifteen minutes. The worst one was when a tween (yes, a literal twelve year old) started preaching to Barbie about consumerism, fascism, and capitalism like she was Jaden Smith talking about the political and economic state of the world. It was insane and laughable.Second of all: the messaging was really messed up and concerning. The end of the movie felt like it was setting up for an actually sweet and heartwarming ending about equality, but it was ruined when the Barbies refused to give the Kens any equality. What the heck was the movie even for then? The Barbies went through literally no character development while the Kens were actually funny and had the only development in the film. Also, the way the Barbies regained power in Barbie Land was baffling. No joke, they ended up making it look like they were cheating on their Ken boyfriends to make the Kens jealous of each other so they would fight. There were absolutely no reprocussions the Barbies had to face for doing this. It was insane. The movie basically taught little girls they should manipulate guys and make them jealous of each other to get what they want.Third of all: Will Ferrell is wasted. He is a big part of the first half of the movie but just kinda disappears in the second half. It's almost like Gerwig forgot about his character but then said \"oh yeah, it's Will Ferrell, we should probably give him a quick scene at the end.\"The only part I really enjoyed in this film was Ryan Gosling and all the other Kens. He is an absolute scene stealer. No one clapped when the movie ended, but people (including me) clapped when Gosling finished his \"Just Ken\" song. It was hilarious. You can tell he was really having fun with it. But all the other actors are just meh. Margot Robbie looks like Barbie, yes, but she doesn't really do anything else to stand out.Overall, Barbie is just wasted potential. What a shame.\n",

      "Was very much looking forward to this movie. It's, unfortunately, terribly written. They needed to figure out how to get all the ladies who don't like Barbie on board so they went way over the top on the \"patriarchy\" at the expense of a real plot and good writing. So many cringe moments (the dancing Kens, Barbie turning into real person, the weird montage at the end) that just didn't make sense. Too bad, a good writer could have made this movie poignant, clever, funny and fun to watch. Instead, the script just pondered.Other reviewers pointed out the ripped off plot lines (Wizard of Oz, Pinocchio, Velveteen Rabbit).The one funny moment was Gosling serenading Barbie on the beach.\n",

      "It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor. But if you are a kid, you can also watch it, even though you will not undestand it a 100%, is visually pleasant!\n",

      "Today I went to see this movie and I was so excited. I loved barbie growing up and watched all the movies, this week I played the Dua Lipa Barbie song on repeat and showed up to watch it in my barbie jumper.I loved the start of it, it was fun and colourful. Ken was hilarious and I got the feeling the plot was going to be about Barbie trying to find a purpose like all the other barbies and Ken becoming his own person but I was really wrong.It took a weird twist and turned into this femenist, anti-men, preachy movie that really took all the fun out of it. The movie said Patriarchy more than it said Barbie and completely dumbed men down just to make the women look better. The movie constantly preached about equality but the film ended with the kens pleading for jobs but being refused. Complete waste of potential.\n",

      "Barbie was so much better than I expected it to be, I thought it would be fun but it definitely nailed everything it went for.While not taking itself seriously as a comedy, it still manages to touch on important topics like inequality. It holds up a mirror that will make some people feel uncomfortable, and this can be seen by some reviews calling it \"preachy\".The performances were so perfect for their respective characters and they did a good job of establishing everyone's role in the story. The story itself had great pacing and kept you interested the whole way throughout.The great thing about Barbie is that it touches on worlds dominated by either Men or Women are both wrong, and the key is finding balance and equality. The Barbie showing opposite sides of the real world.It also had great positive masculinity, especially during the Ken fight, they could have just gone for a generic case of them fighting each others and looking like they can't control themselves. Instead they had them overcome their differences and appreciate each other.I also appreciate they gave Ken a good ending too, having his character not be defined by being with Barbie, and instead being proud of just being himself. Which again, parallels the pressure on Women being defined by their partner.A certain crowd won't understand any of the points made by this movie and will just call it \"preachy\" some reviews I've read on here have definitely not watched the movie.It's a fun comedy that will make you laugh and also think, overall a great experience and will likely be the film of the year.\n",

      "On the surface, \"Barbie\" looks fun and light but nothing could be further from the truth, as this movie delves into some dark stuff. That's why it works. It presents an optimistic world that is all facade, and if you peel away the layers, you are reminded of the reality that things are not so great. You could say that there is some level of men-bashing here, but that is all in service to how Mattel has chosen to portray the Ken doll as mere accessory to Barbie. So the movie doubles down on that, and with the comedic talent of Ryan Gosling, the movie gets to up the ante on the patriarchy satire. I especially like the part when Ken learns and practices to wave his finger 'no' at a female assistant. As for the casting of Barbie, Margot Robbie does a great job and truly fits the Barbie look. However in my mind the celebrity actress most physically resembling Barbie has always been 1970s Priscilla Barnes from \"Three's Company.\" And kudos to America Ferrera's funny, nuanced portrayal of a mom having an existential crisis. How about that monologue? I love the satire part of this movie, including the musical numbers, and I see where they are going with the philosophical musings at the end, but the sappiness becomes too much.\n",

      "This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not \"anti men\" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don't understand in what world that message is \"anti men\".\n",

      "At the beginning there were little girls playing with dolls. Then came Barbie. The narrator said something about them pretending to be mothers to their dolls and then they (the little girls/toddlers) began to destroy their dolls. I don't know about you, but for me, they imply that being a mother is somewhat something negative. Barbie is meant to inspire young girls to be whatever they want, but why do they suddenly make it sound like wanting to be a mother is not something good they can strive to be? So if a little girl wants to be a doctor or an astronaut, that's fine (it is), but if she wants to be a mother, it sounds as if it is frowned upon. Tsk tsk.Also, I just can't understand why Barbie and Ken can't be equals. Why do we need one extreme or the other? Why do we need to have COMPETELY Barbie or COMPLETELY Ken? Why can't it be BarKen land? Or KenRie land? You may argue that at the end they somewhat reach equality between Barbie and Ken, but in my opinion, it's not true. Barbies \"allow\" the Kens to also be politicians, but just at a lower ranking. That's equality? I also noticed that once Barbie and Ken first went into the real world, Ken saw that men can also have jobs. From my point of view, he was just very excited that he, a man, could also have a job, but he just became an extreme.Honestly, we have fought for equality, and what is this? Teaching young children that you can only have one or the other, but not a balance? Doesn't this remind you of 60-70 years ago?\n",

      "Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023. Many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame, and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction. Is it rough? In a way yes. But it's deliberately lame, they're living puppets, it's obvious that this is lame. The big complaint about the film is about the critics, as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is, but again, it's on purpose. The criticism works very well, the characters work, the universe built here is incredible. Visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year, a world all pink could be very strange, but it turned out beautiful and very convincing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention, on the other hand, when they try to focus on other characters, the quality is not the same. Some characters don't work, particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life. Overall, this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023.\n",

      "Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.\n",

      "This movie was not what I expected at first, but I loved it. It's been years since I watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic. Taika Waititi said in an interview that Hollywood (particularly superhero) movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life. I feel like Barbie could be the start of the un-darkening of Hollywood movies.As a woman with some trauma, I love a good gritty woman-run movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a man's world. Sometimes though, you just want some feel-good escapism that isn't forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message across.I've seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didn't make sense. I feel like the way they executed it made sense for a Barbie movie. I've also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since Kens aren't equal in Barbieland, I loved that part especially. In the same way that I don't like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message, I think it also sucks when a movie takes *too* light of an approach because it's scared to actually say something. Of course the Kens aren't equal in Barbieland 1) Ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for Barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was \"loose\" and 2) they are toys made by people, they are a product (lol) of their makers. So yes, Barbies are in charge, but Barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny (or any form of bigotry) states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservient.The audience in the theatre I was in seemed to feel the same way, because when the narrator said, \"Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. Eventually they'll have as much rights as women have in the real world.\" I swear everyone was laughing. It really connected with the audience from what I saw. So many clever points were made in a nonsensical Barbie pink package and it was just perfect. If you made it this far on my review, you're going to have the best day ever today. And tomorrow. And the day after that. And every day from now until forever <3.\n",

      "I'm not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film, but I'm certain that it is 100% a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys' and girls' dolls and all their accessories.It doesn't paint the manufacturer in a good light, making the CEO (Ferrell, whom I heartily dislike anyway) a buffoon, along with all the men who occupy the boardroom.It makes several well-placed jabs at patriarchy, and the real world, but seems disjointed and searching for a meaningful plot. I swear, this is the last Gerwig movie I will subject myself to, because I find all of her films to date to be confusing and pointless.The two leads (Robbie and Gosling) are perfect, as is the rest of the cast, especially Kate McKinnon as the weird doll. (I refuse to write the names of the manufacturer or the dolls as my own little protest of blatant consumerism and marketing to children.)

I'm not sure why there's rave reviews, but I painfully stuck it out, waiting until the end for this movie to redeem itself.....and nothing. Lower your expectations for this movie, it's really not good. Probably the only 2 redeeming qualities of this movie was the character played by Kate McKinnon, she was good. And the song sung by Ken (Ryan Gosling), I'm Just Ken - it was well written & performed. Other than that, so, so bad.

The set designs and camp were beyond entertaining and some of the scenes were so out of this world and hilarious.

It begins very well, but tumbles down from there. Real-world seems more cartoonish than the Barbie world. That could be the real reason for Barbie to come out of Barbie-world and turn into a human.

The story starts in our time in Barbie Land. One day her feet are getting flat and she goes to Weird Barbie for advice,she sends her to the Real World. Ken hides in the car and goes with Barbie. There Barbie founds out very upset things,but Ken the exact opposite. He brings his knowledge of patriarchy into Barbie land and everything goes upside down.

She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It's light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be.

      "I am shocked at how polarizing this movie has been in terms of feedback. I say this as someone who was not anxiously anticipating its release nor as someone who was triggered by it's growing popularity, I went into this with neutrality. I knew this would have more powerful messaging than it seemed as I am a fan of Gerwigs previous works, but I knew if it did not that the film probably would leave me unfulfilled. For that reason, I was most bored during the first section of the film that was too lighthearted childlike for my taste but I was excited to get into the deeper plot points. This being said, I recognize the film was marketed ingeniously to produce buzz, however it was ineffective in describing what the movie was really about. I can totally see why parents may have thought this was appropriate for children despite the PG-13 rating but this absolutely was not made for kids. This was a campy commentary on the patriarchy in America and the modern feminist movement. These plot points were actually my biggest criticisms of it. From my perspective this displayed an accurate depiction modern feminism, which often neglects to acknowledge it's roots grown by in black feminists and the patriarchies disproportionate effects on low income women, especially those of color. This movie promoted a feminist message that feels decades behind, and in such an obvious way that I am shocked that this explored new ideas or dramatically moved anyone in the audience. It was a blunt reminder of how behind we are but not even through the messaging in the film but rather how viewers are reacting. The only feminist commentary beneath surface level that I would've been more excited to explore were made via side comments from various side characters like the socialist/anarchist daughter (who by the way I found upset to have seen painted as mean and then only kind after conforming to barbie's ideas of feminism, but I digress). With all that being said, it had a fantastic soundtrack, made me laugh quite a few times and Ryan Goslings acting was superb (ironically) although the whole cast did well with the script they were given. Justice for Michael Cera's character! I would've loved to see his cravings to break away from societal norms be further explored! The movie was fun, campy in a more obvious way than I usually like, but that's the mainstream Hollywood box office industry for you. My overall take is this wasn't made for a person like me who craves exploring new ideas or highlighting important calls to action as they relate to feminism rather than this rehashing this surface level anti-patriarchy message. I am glad that this is making people converse in what I'm understanding are new ideas to many, I am just shocked that they are in fact, new.\n",

I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s.

Not forced , not sketchy , not masculine but entirely simple , vivid & full of feminine traits.Sexism works both ways . (First Barbie getting annoyed over Ken's desperation & later Ken taking over the Barbieland) This movie just shows if both Men & Women listen to eachother & work for their inner souls they can let go of their respective personal bad blood & stupid patriarchal things which has been a stigmata of this giant world.

The daughter character doesn't contribute much to the story, she's really just that one grumpy teenage character who turns out to have a heart after all, but it just didn't make sense in the story. Next the entire corporation storyline didn't make sense at all. In the beginning it was like fine, they try to get barbie back to barbieland, but then she goes back herself, they follow her and from that point they contribute literally nothing to the story anymore. I forgot they were there until they suddenly appeared out of the bushes. It just lacked depth and logic and in my opinion it just wasn't necessary to have made the movie to what it was.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie a lot, but some plot points just weren't what I expected them to be.

      "I don't know if I've ever seen anything quite like Barbie, which is rewarding if you ask me, especially since I haven't been this excited for any other release this year. So what did I think of it?For starters, I really admire the production of this movie. Gorgeous does not begin to describe the sets, and it's commendable how well they highlight the surrealism of Barbieland. I had seen a YouTube video exploring Barbie's Dreamhouse and already concluded in my mind that it was pretty great, but seeing it in the context of the movie just made it better. The costumes are great too.Furthermore, the acting is alright! Huge props to Margot Robbie. The movie blends humour and angst with some other tonal elements, which means that it demands more from the actors than you would assume at first. The ensemble cast was obviously up to the task, but something in their performances caught my attention. I vaguely remember Gerwig mentioning in an interview the issue of considering the technicalities of a typical Barbie's movements. You can notice several points in the movie where the actors embrace the stiff and wooden movements of a doll, but at other less noticeable or relevant moments, they're as flexible as a living entity whilst in Barbieland. I don't know how one would navigate a perfectly adequate balance between the two, but my brain couldn't ignore this mild inconsistency, whether you consider it important or not (and I do). The film did utilize this for comedic effect though, and I thought that was a nice touch.While there are more things I like than dislike about this movie, I feel like the execution leaves something to be desired. The first act of the movie is everything I'd hoped it would be; campy, funny, and exceedingly pink. I love that even the subsequent scenes in Barbieland embrace this quirkiness, irrespective of the stakes. However, the transition from Barbie and Co's everyday shenanigans to her journey of awareness and self-discovery felt a bit... sudden? While it aptly gives focus to the main conflict of the movie, I feel like the heavy marketing of the movie had already given away too many glimpses of Barbieland before I saw the film. It took away the element of wonder and left the superficial part of me a little disappointed. Also, the final two-thirds of the movie is just shy of overstimulating. I hate to say it, but the reinforcement of women empowerment ideals isn't done tastefully and comes off harsher than it should, and the sharp tonal change preceding it doesn't help. The exploration of switched gender roles from Barbieland to the real world was another clever idea whose execution lacked finesse. This made Ryan Gosling's Ken briefly unlikeable to me; he saved the performance with his undeniable charisma and sense of humour. And even though I thought the ending was a nice surprise (that scene with the Billie Eilish number is one of the most beautiful things ever), I was sadly distracted by the non-subtlety of the preceding events, however funny or thoughtful they were. Perhaps I would appreciate it better with a second watch.So yeah, Barbie is an experience. Tune in for the colourful heaps of fun, and stay for the emotional and humanistic themes. But beware of the untidy edges.\n",

      "I had no idea what to expect but did not expect what I saw .I go to a few movies a week and always try to enjoy them based on their merits . I mean , not everything can The Godfather.I expected a movie that was just dumb fun, but it was not that .I thought the movie started ok and got interesting when Barbi went into the real world . I think the tried and true fish out of water concept would have been really worth exploring more in this movie .I thought casting was fine , Margot Robbie owns the screen and Gosling was ok . But you are only as good as the script you are given .The cinematography was fine. Barbiland was bright and colourful as you'd expect. No complaints there .I felt the agenda and messaging was way too heavy handed. A missed opportunity for nuance and balance . What the writers were trying to say was just super clunky and the victim of this was good story telling .I can't imagine children caring about what they were trying to say . What was advertised as a light hearted and breezy movie is really an attempt to be a social commentary. I think it's false marketing .Movie 4/10\n",

      "This movie deserves all the praise and the awards it'll surely win! I couldn't stop laughing. It's full of smart jokes, touching moments, and has one of the best sets I've ever seen in a film. Highly highly recommend. It has a wonderful message for both men and women. I hope the success of this movie leads to more films directed by, starring, and made for women. Hollywood has spent far too long catering to men, I see a cultural shift in the next few years. Women want good movies too, with strong, well developed, independent female characters that don't rely on men to interact with one another. Looking forward to more movies like Barbie.\n",

      "Seen this as a birthday present with my mom and sister. My birthday was on the 21st, but I ended up seeing the Barbie movie on the 22nd - Joan jett's birthday, wearing my Joan Jett necklace that I had received as a birthday gift, along with my Joan Jett slash Barbie inspired outfit. So, this will go down in history as a very special movie outing for me. I felt like I was going to the actual premiere!Weird Barbie was my fave! Kate McKinnon is so attractive!! And even though they say that she was based on David Bowie, I saw a lot of Phyllis Diller in her! Yay for Weird Barbie! My other favorite character was the Barbie creator played by Rhea Perlman.Wanted to slap the kid for most of the film for being so rude to her mother and just so grumpy in general, and I felt bad for Ken. I expected that he was going to be an actual villain, but he wasn't. Based on the reviews I read and the criticisms that people had of this movie, I was expecting a really bad guy, but he was just a hurt guy. Ken just wanted as much love as Barbie had, and isn't that understandable? I really felt for him. And I like that I felt for him, because I would rather that than to hate him, the way a lot of the reviewers seem to.I adored the musical numbers! I adored the colors! And this movie was a lot more emotional than I expected. It actually made me start to cry! I was surprised.I didn't like that Barbie kept pushing Ken away though, saying that she wasn't in love with him. That's just completely against everything that the Barbie can relationship stands for - the fact is, he's her boyfriend, and eventually they do get married! I mean look at any Barbie coloring book from the '90s, and before. This whole Barbie doesn't need ken, that's just some new made up thing. She's always loved Ken and he's always loved her - that's one of the reasons why they are considered an ideal couple. So, I didn't like that part, nor did I like the part of the little girls basically beating up their baby dolls. I thought that was so crass and sad a sight. The idea that they were trying to convey could have been conveyed in a much nicer manner. But overall, a very good movie. Well done! Well done!Oh, and I almost forgot, Helen Mirren as the narrator! How wonderful a choice!!\n",

I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought \"how did they even come up with all of this\". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.In one word: iconic.\n",

I think the writers could have done a much better job of presenting their theme without pandering.

It has so many fun elements in it but still gives off its message so clearly. How well it was filmed and directed was truly astounding to see how it was not only visually beautiful and aesthetically pleasing but also the writing and the acting.

The jokes, the references seem to me pretty « cerebral » except the first one used in the trailer and some of Ryan Gosling ones when as a character he really go for it trying to be the one ! Otherwise, I felt pretty left outside of it as if in some kind of populist political meeting where all the ideas of the moment are expressed. Ok why not, but I came for a story with emotions... and some catharsis. Here I felt there were 4 attempts of making us have a catharsis... but none really worked for me. A cerebral mumble jumble.\n",

      "After having seen Oppenheimer (also reviewed) in 35MM and IMAX 70MM, I decided it was time to view the other half of Barbenheimer. With my local cinema usually being quiet, and the film having been out for weeks, I was happy to find that the screening of Barbie was almost sold out when I got one of the few tickets left, leading to me entering Barbie's world.View on the film:Welcoming the audience to Barbie's world (life in plastic, it's fantastic) with a crane shot landing in Barbie's Dreamhouse, ( with the shot fully displaying the amazing production design) co-writer (with her husband Noah Baumbach) / directing auteur Greta Gerwig & The Homesman (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto unbox a tantalizing fantastical atmosphere shining in a kaleidoscope of pinks and Jacques Demy- inspired bursting primary colours.Gliding across Barbieland to sparkling Musical numbers from toe-tapping tunes by Andrew Wyatt and Mark Ronson, Gerwig plays with in the land with an opening tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which merrily sets the stage for ultra-stylized paper cut montages, casting the real world in muted, grounded colours, and shimmering close-ups of Barbie dancing off with Ken.Bringing all his Kenergy to the role,Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as Ken, with Gosling visibly enjoying expressing Ken's lack of self-awareness as he attempts to woo Barbie with one-liners that are left hanging in the air, whilst Michael Cera gives an adorable, awkward turn as Allan, and Will Ferrell displays (some) restrain from his now typical shouting manner, with an amusing boo-hiss turn as the Mattel CEO.Revealing in an interview that she said to the studio that because \" now you've got Barbie and Greta Gerwig,\" the film would be certain to make a Billion at the Box Office, Margot Robbie gives a magical performance in the title role, thanks to Robbie performing the dead-pan comedic one-liners in a exuberant manner, and also displaying an enticing, unshakable eagerness, blossoming when Barbie drives away from Barbieland.Leaving Barbieland behind for the first time, (leaving the familiar safety net, also being a major theme in Lady Bird) the screenplay by Gerwig and Baumbach splendidly threads very funny fish out of water set-pieces with empowering statements against toxic masculinity and casual sexism, as Barbie runs over every attempt made to force her away from a path of self-discovery, and into a small, marketable little box, by waving farewell to Barbieland.\n",

Will Ferrell, was perfectly cast and hilarious as always. The portrayal of the Barbie world was very well done. The nasty shocks Barbie got when coming into the real world were also very funny. However, the movie soon descended into philosophical and political plot points which just felt weird. If it was just a bit more like Toy Story and a little less like Legally Blonde, it would have been perfect. It just took itself a bit too seriously and just laid some stuff on really thick. It's hard to know who this movie was pitched to. I would have thought it would be for families, but a lot of this would have flown right over many people's heads. It's a shame.

But through all this Barbie realises she doesn want to go back to being perfect for everyone to project their ideals on her but just live as a regular human. Cute right? Yeah they only problem is NOTHING was convincing. The adventures of our characters were not enough to transform them yet they did change. The only well developed character was KEN. Not only his character arc was amazing compared to the others, it also was a fine commentary of how patriarchy damages young men. So of it was called Ken then I would have rated it like 7, but its a Barbie movie and unfortunately our female lead had the laziest character arc and the most Deus ex machina development ever.Ironically she was through it all really sweet and likeable. Maybe a meta commentary of what women are appreciated for? Sweet and likeable is enough but anything more is too much? And also she only wants to be seen as human?

His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children.

Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.\n",

      "With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.\n",

      "It is a film of absurd humour (which is funny in many moments) that criticises political models, fragile masculinity and society both past and present.The approach is to turn current society on its head and make Barbieland a world dominated by women, where they form the elite of society and the Kens are simply their boyfriends, irrelevant, unemployed, kept, objects. Basically what women are in the macho society.When Barbie and Ken arrive in the real world, Barbie realises that the world is upside down, that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men, and Ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in Barbieland. So far, the script and the critics are being perfect.After a lot of criticism of the hetero-male behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour, the critical moment arrives, the message of the film. The Barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly don't want to go back to the previous model where they ruled. I say SUPPOSEDLY, because they do go back to that model. One Ken asks the president of Barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the president's answer is, yes, but from below and little by little.In the end the Barbies, after discovering the reality of the real world, adopt the same model. They do not accept the Kens as equals, NO, let them gradually integrate. Just as it has happened with women, who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women. It was the perfect time to talk about equality, to think about a new model, about evolution. And there is no solution, the barbies continue with the model of today's society. So the film doesn't contribute anything, what is the wonderful message, they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against. If you make a social and political criticism, you have to propose your own solution. In Barbie there is no solution, the solution is the current system.Therefore it is overrated. And on top of not showing the reality of the \"Barbie world\" they show Barbies of all races and sizes, do they sell XXL Barbies? Or Barbies and Ken of all races? They show a diversity that the Barbie universe has never had.\n",

      "My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.\n",

      "I was really excited to see Barbie, but sadly the film came up short for me.On the positive side of things, the film has plenty of creativity and the idea of recreating the doll's actual world was a cool one (no stairs, no liquid in cups, feet permanently on tip toes, etc). Margot Robbie was excellent as always. Cudos to Mattel for their willingness to sign off on a film that depicts their company in such a negative light. That isn't something you commonly see.On the negative side of things, the plot felt a bit like a rehash of the dozen or so other films I've seen that feature a \"two worlds colliding theme.\" A lot of the silly ideas I was expecting to find funny (the beach off) fell flat for me and seemed to rely more on just saying the same joke over and over, rather than using it in a creative way.The film's messages about the crushing weight of society's expectations on women and the uneven distribution of power/respect felt hamstrung by the lack of depth in the characters. Ken (Gosling) comes off as an idiot for the entire film and the CEO of Mattel feels more like a cartoon villain than a real person. In the end, the barbies don't aim to create a more just society, but are content instead to simply replicate problematic structures in the opposite direction. The film ends with little to no character development, no one seems to have learned anything by the end of the film. The patriarchy, which this film centers around, is reduced in places to drinking brewskies, horses, and brainwashing. Those kind of reductions make it hard to appreciate the social message that the film portrays and sells the audience's intelligence short.Part of the problem for me, I think, is I am unsure of who the target audience for this film is meant to be. If this is meant for children, the simplistic characters and over the top messaging might make sense but the themes and jokes feel a bit dark and too adult for them. If this is meant for adults, the characters lack the nuance that Gerwig was able to show in some of her other work (Ladybird).In the end, there are a few fun moments in this film, but the films heavy handed messaging mixed with the lack of depth/nuance in characters means it doesn't hit nearly as hard as it probably should have.\n",

      "I really liked the movie. Without going into too much detail, I was surprised when I realized the movie was made more for us who played with the Barbies way back in the day. You think it's directed at the younger generations but it actually fits since even my own daughter never wanted nor played with a Barbie. I myself had the entire entourage,(and still have them, almost 40 years later) so it was much more endearing and relatable. I liked the underlying themes, which added depth and perspective that I didn't expect at all. I think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics . It gives people a chance to think, feel and relate to it, without having the movie become too heavy, or being 'too much'. People that thought it was confusing probably didn't understand that the movie intended to keep it lighthearted for this very reason. I recommend seeing it, especially if you have a Barbie still tucked away on your closet, too.\n",

      "Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more.

      "This movie is not for kids despite the trailers I saw not showing it may not be for kids. I only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie, and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in Barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world. The sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy. The sub plot should have been the main plot. The set design was great, the world looked beautiful, the story just sucked. Not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and I thought they leaned way to hard into this. If they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least. I grew up playing with Barbies and I am sorry, but my Barbies always loved their kens. For Barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion. There was not enough Barbieland and too much stupidity.\n",

Today's world is certainly patriarchal, but the film's story was vague and filled with too many topics (poorly developed) and platitudes The role of some of the actors, such as Will Ferrell, seemed meaningless to me. The film covered important themes, but wanted to cover too much and yet covered nothing.The animation, cinematography and effects are wonderful. But the story falls short.I do not recommend it.\n",

The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.\n",

I have been watching movies for so many years and I have seen everything, but in recent years the movies are becoming more and more disappointing. I was very happy that the movie attracted people to the cinema, I also went to see Oppenhaimer and it was wonderful but really, this movie is completely forgettable.

      "The Barbie Movie stars Ryan Gosling (Ken), Issa Rae (President Barbie), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Will Ferrell. (Matel CEO), Simu Liu (Ken), and Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken).Directed by Greta Gerwig and written by; Noah Baumbach and Gerwig-the crisis in Barbie (2023) is that Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.There are several highlights to the Barbie Movie. Ben-Adir (Ken) changed his voice to that of Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as his Marvel Cinematic Universe Character named Gravik. Only several men in the cinema understood the MCU reference. Speaking of men-Barbie references male dominance in the real world as something that is concealed by men obtaining Phd degrees and certifications. Moreover, men are portrayed as fools in this movie. Gloria played by America Ferrera has a husband who struggles with the Spanish language and the Ken's think more with the head on their groin areas rather than their heads with a brain in it.All in all Barbie is a good movie for women empowerment, I give it a 5/10. Nonetheless, if a Barbie movie universe was created then I would most likely support it for the funny male depictions.\n",

This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes.

It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster.

Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.\n",

      "Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. From the first photos on set to the huge marketing, barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor. It delivers amazing performances from the whole cast, Robbie and Gosling with unmatched chemistry, Ferrera's monologue and everybody else.The message is clear, how it is to be a woman in this reality, a mother, a daughter.. feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter. Greta managed to tell us how impactful Barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to self-conscious girls.She exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy. At first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but you'll understand that the same Barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes. This judgment is already solved in the message of the movie, Greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moral.It's camp, it's fun and it's pop.The script is smart and well written, it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation, Barbie and Ruth Handler, and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by Gloria (Ferrera). There's a handful of cinema references, from Kubrick's 2001: space odyssey to The Wizard of Oz, there are jokes on movies that aren't to be taken to seriously, you'll find them funny.Jokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that you'll absolutely agree with.It's not only a feminist message but Barbie expands its themes to Ken's character. The difficulty to found his own identity, to be someone outside of his shadow (his barbie).This film is demential and intelligent, an adaptation of the loveable doll, you can have fun with it but also write a whole essay about its moral and heart.\n",

I knew it was going to be a little emotional. But what i didn't expect was for it to completely rip my heart out and stick it back in my chest!Greta Gerwig has a truly beautiful soul and she has a very unique way of expressing that that really resonates with me and many other people especially women. She always knows how to pull off that intense third act monologue about being a woman that hits you right in your soul and causes you to rethink everything.I have never seen a movie that explains how exhausting it is to be a woman not only around men, but around other women. America Ferrera, who plays Gloria, has a insanely heartfelt beautiful monologue where she says \"i'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us\" and i have never felt something deeper in my heart.Never thought i'd say this but this movie absolutely changed my life and i will love it for life.\n",

This film depicts the harsh truth women must live with, which is that this is \" a man's world\". Not a very pleasant fact when your nature gravitates towards unity, happiness, femininity, not war and power. However, the ending is inspiring and masking the saddening patriarchal reality we are trapped into, therefore you don't leave the cinema being depressed.Thank you Greta Gerwig, how much the little girl in me needed the comfort this masterpiece offers, i cannot put into words.

The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn't necessarily a kids movie even though it's called \"Barbie\", a doll.

      "I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I found out it would exist. I turned my whole world pink. And then I was sitting there in the cinema hall, bored. Yes, I did like the pink Barbie Land. Yes, I loved how they portrayed the actors as innocent Barbie/Ken/(Allan) dolls in their childlike fantasy world. But what happened next? Barbie faced depression, thoughts of death, cellulite, and flat feet (actually, I kind of liked how they freaked out because of that lol). Well, okay, fine - this could still turn out great, couldn't it? Barbie and her \"obviously pain in the neck\" Ken, who appeared more relatable to me than Barbie herself, embarked on a playful and lovely journey to the \"real world.\" The CEO of Mattel kind of saved that real-world experience for me. Barbie meets a rebellious teen girl and her mother in a crisis and takes them back to Barbie Land, where Ken, who figured out that men can also rule the world, turned the pink glitter style into a \"Kendom.\" So far, so good. What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I'm saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother. And when Barbie decided to live as a human - the already known talk about how cruel human life can be. The only refreshing thing was Ken's battle and the song \"I'm just Ken.\" The ever-popular Barbie turned out to be an aging woman who just can't get on with her life and treats the only person who is always by her side (her Ken) like trash, which was the worst for me personally. I felt like no one in the full cinema hall laughed at all during that movie. And the people left the cinema confused and silent.\n",

      "This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to \"apologize\" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.\n",

Im still confused as to what the movie actually wants to potray.theres not a clear intended audience for this . It references so many old movies which makes it way too boring. Even the dialogues are boring . There is not a clear line in the story line. Way too much plugging of outfits.the producer actually spent more time on marketing than they on getting a good storyline.tmost of the jokes were annoying and cheesy.overall the movie is wierd and bogus.\n",

      "Begrudgingly, I took my granddaughter and her friend to this movie, who dressed in high heels and pink checkered dresses to match the one Barbie wears in the movie. They looked adorable. It was really good. Not one of my top 10 best ever, movies. But not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I particularly liked the \"KEN\" dance, although the two teenyboppers beside me laughed all the way through the scene. Personally I think Ryan Gosling carried the movie, and the only thing that kept me entertained. He was excellent. I asked the girls if they know what the overall message of the movie was about, and both said \"No\" rather nonchalantly. I asked what was there best part, and both said, \"I don't know\", what was your least favourite part? \"I don't know\". Did you like the movie, and both said \"Yes\". I thought the messaging was good for an adult, but it went over the heads of the young teens.\n",

      "Thank you for this movie ! It's beautiful by the décor, costumes and music, but so much more beautiful with the message. We do need that kind of movie in our world.People (men, lol) seems to be confused after seeing the Barbie movie. Maybe it's time to accept the world as it is now and understand how cruel it could be for the half of the world population. I think you are proving the point of the movie.We do need more movies like Barbie, that can keep the funny in important messages. In many movies, they need violence, rudeness and/or vulgarity to show how the female character is in pain. Thanks to Barbie, we don't have to see this to know, we don't have to be triggered to understand what kind of feelings she is going through. Barbie is like us. Barbie is for us.

This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it.

Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either.

It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed the movie. Michael Cera was probably my favorite actor along with Ryan gosling and surprisingly Kate McKinnon. The story and adventure was really fun, I was absolutely in love with the visuals throughout the film, and I thought the self awareness was really refreshing. The music also energized the film throughout. With all that being said, I did have two complaints. The first is that the conclusion of the movie is that men and women can't work together, and I think that was a really strange choice. I understand that the movie wanted to empower independence but collaboration is also very important. Second complaint, why the heck was there a Chevrolet commercial in the middle of the movie?

      "I love that this film incorporates comedy and realism into it. I also like the fact that it wasn't entirely about Barbie and woman, but also about men and that they also have feelings and emotions. As a 15 year old girl, this made me think about what its like from my mother perspective in life, and that no matter, what they will always support us in what we want to be or dream to be. Coming out of the theatre, a whirlwind of emotions flooded my mind. Glorias speech made me realise that even though the world and people demand us to be perfect doesn't mean we have to achieve those demands, we need to find ourselves and love ourselves before we love anyone or let anyone love us. I understand that men feel as though Ken deserved a bit of leadership ad power, but the Barbies built that land. Us woman love this movie because it opens up our imagination of what we can be, and though people says \" Oh, they could've let the Ken's have a bit of ownership and power\" But when Barbie went to the real world, you could see from most women's perspective of what their life is like on a daily basis 'not saying all men are like this stereotype'. Barbieland gives young girls the motivation and the idea that they CAN be a president, a construction worker, an astronaut, an they can be weird. I understand that people hav their different opinions, and this is just mine.\n",

I love it so much, came with a bunch of friends, my mom, their moms, and my little sister. Everyone said that they lived the movie. The ending made me cry but in such a good way, like how Barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time. Seeing a movie that doesn't have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing, and honestly, if you're mad at this movie, you might be part of the problem. Seeing Ruth appear and give Barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience. I loved it so much I can't even explain. Seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshing.When the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into it.And can we talk about how well Will Ferrell played his role? And don't even get me started on Margot's acting. Literally amazing, she played her role so wellThis movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more. At the end when Barbie said her name (Barbara) was so amazing because she was originally named after Ruth's daughter, I loved that so much.And honestly I think that everybody needs to see this movie, no matter what your standpoint on life is, everyone needs to see this movie.And seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing. I could go on and on about how good this movie made me feel but I would be here all day.It was such a good movie and I would definitely watch it again. Such a good watch.\n",

The cinema i was in was sure packed but that wasnt a good message. \"To save barbieland we must lie and cheat on our boyfriends\" not sure a lot of parents would like that message either. Then the film wraps up wonderfully about barbie becoming human and herself instead of playing the role of barbie which was wonderful.. But are we supposed to just pretend and forget the message of this film just five minutes ago is to cheat on your boyrfriends and lie to them once youve gained their trust and made them happy? Hmm. Ryan gosling however was amazing to witness. Totally amazing just like he was in any other gosling film. Drive and blade runner being my favs.I will rewatch this because the comedy is very much on point but ill fast forward a lot of the extremist feminist speeches as they leave a questionable aftertaste when examined.

      "\"Barbie the movie\" left me disappointed and unimpressed. The storyline felt overly simplistic, lacking depth and originality. The dialogue was clichéd, often predictable, and failed to engage the audience. The characters seemed one-dimensional, and their development was superficial at best. The animation, touted as a highlight, fell short of expectations, lacking the polish and detail one would anticipate from a major production. Overall, it failed to capture the attention of both children and adults, making it a forgettable viewing experience. Even the scene with America Ferrera felt so forced and cliche and it fed on superficial emotions.\n",

Then I read a review by Michael Knowles, and I realized I missed something very crucial at the start. My teenaged daughter and I went back, and we watch it from the beginning. This is a very clever movie. The layers of cleverness become very apparent when you look beyond the surface. It is a story of current society- and the ills that plague us.I think, at first, everyone is concerned about the audience for the movie- it is definitely not meant for younger kids. But it is rated PG-13- I'd say the innuendo is a bit much for 13, but it may just go right over their heads. Ultimately, I think this movie has been very misjudged by a lot of critics. It is way deeper than Barbie maybe should be, but it is great for adults who don't like what they see in our current state of existence.\n",

I would say that perhaps this Greta's most loved film but that would be an extreme allegation considering the public opinion. The movie roars out of the gate with an inventiveness and energy which perhaps the audience was not all set for. The film spreads its politics explicitly, using rudimentary ideas about the performance of gender, gender inequality and consumerism to fuel the plot and inform its comic beats. You would even forget that the movie is actually, and in essence, about a doll because the plot is quite indulging.

While watching this move i expected more and more from it, but ive got dissapointed in the end that it ended in cliche, no plotwist and nothing original way. Would have been amazing if they made exactly same idea like that Wolf Among Us game. Imagine Barbies and Kens living in our world, but in a dark our world's natural way.

Robbie and Gosling are stellar, and Gerwig's camera has never been in better focus.What I really want to talk about is the idea of perfection and that flaws are not deterrents; flaws are what make us who we are.Barbie is perfect. But what is perfection? Beauty? Endless dance parties? A world where everyone gets along? A world without worry? No; those are hollow. Perfection is an illusion. There is no happiness or self-worth in perfection. Perfection is a lie that hides the real joy of life.Owning who you are, finding joy with yourself, being brave enough to face the conflicts each rising sun brings, and combating the fear that you aren't good enough is where real, true experiences are found.Barbie is perfect, and she wants to maintain her perfection. But as her journey unfolds, she discovers something better-self-realization.Ken lacks agency, and Barbie cannot give that to Ken. He must find it himself. Barbie is about empowerment, discovery, and owning the person you are. No one defines you; you define you.Barbie and Ken's first experience in the real world is an all-too-expected scene. Unfortunately, the likely reaction to it from some will also be expected.Barbie is an object, something to obtain. Ken is a person, someone to converse with or admire. The difference in experience is drastic, and-sadly-one that will surely be looked over and taken at face value.The point of the scene is not \"it's hard to be a woman.\" The point is that Ken is oblivious to the difference. He's so wrapped up in his own experience that he can't see Barbie's. He doesn't question why their experiences are different; he doesn't care. He just wants his experience to be enjoyable. He wants his life to be more, even at the expense of others.Too many will see it as surface level. And too many will refuse to dig deeper. Instead, they'll be content to be outraged or faux-offended. \"My life is hard too!\" they'll say. And that's the point. Her life is hard, his life is hard, everyone's life is hard. Consideration is all it takes to better both.Barbie has a lot to say about agency and self-realization, and really, the film is quite meta in the best way.\n",

It may make it somewhat difficult to discuss the slight differences between the characters, but so what?I just hope they don't make a sequel.

Director Greta Gerwig (supported by screenwriter Noah Baumbach) doesn't just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon: colorful set designs, stunning costumes and make-up, great music (they all sing!), the history of the Barbie doll, but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism, patriarchy, feminism, diversity, inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense. As a film, Barbie delivers it all: fun, excitement and seriousness. The casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken is also the right choice.

This one was definitely dedicated to women. As a girl, if you haven't seen it, I would recommend you go as soon as you can. It is especially empowering to young girls because it truly shows the essence of a woman. The trailer was not enough to capture the beauty of this movie. It was definitely more than what I expected. I completely understand why anyone would think that the men were portrayed as 'dumb' (obviously in the real world, men aren't as bad as the movie makes it seem) but I think what was meant to come from this movie was a deeper message, and this may have been necessary to really capture what the movie was trying to portray for all women. It was needed to emphasize the movie so to speak.\n",

      "So much garbage. I don't get this movie at all. Let me explain myself. This is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this. What kind of audience was this movie made for? Doesn't look like it was made for kids, nor adults. Just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are. Who thought this would be a good idea? Same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately. Margo Robbie as Barbie? Some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia, like Mulan, the lion king or scooby doo to name a few. This one failed doing so.\n",

      "Originally when I went into the cinema my expectations were quite low however I was pleasantly surprised. Everything from the set, the dances, the music, the costumes and the actors were phenomenal. Credit to Ryan Gosling, he fulfilled his role as Ken so well and his interactions with Margot Robbie were top notch. I loved the amount of secret cameos that went into when making this movie. This piece of media will go down in history as it has been so well done and the message(s) in it were very much prevalent. I couldn't be happier, I adore this movie and I cannot wait to watch it again at home.\n",

      "Salute to the marketing department for creating a buzz like no other, hyping up a film based on what many girls want or dream to be, probably. 1 point for Margot Robbie who is perfect as a barbie-like character, perhaps better becoming the brand ambassador of the brand and stars in all their ads.The film, not sure who's their targeting, children to convey the heavy social issues they are trying to preach, or adults to watch this abomination-children-kind of for, apart from the abs of Ryan Gosling and/or Simu Liu that they keep showing, film. The film tried to be funny, 😑, but the real joke is when somebody think that this is a film worth wasting 2 hours of their life. Ridiculous.\n",

      "This is just one of the two films that are released on the same day (the other being Oppenheimer). Firstly, the movie itself was good; a few comic jokes here and there along with a few heartfelt moments at the end. But I'm not technically a Barbie fan; I just see something that I fancy on the big screen and watch it!Anyway, after watching the movie, I thought to myself, \"Gosh, I'm amazed at how the filmmakers got to create such a variety of cast members, as well as make such a great movie for the girls to enjoy.\"For someone as me - who is somewhat of a film expert and a cinema employee - to see what might be just the most iconic blockbuster movie of the year so far, I have to say that it could (by a margin) be busy for the first couple of weeks of the summer holidays!Overall, though it was good, it's not my favourite movie as I'm not a fan of the doll franchise.\n",

      "It seemed like they wanted the barbie movie to be bigger like have this great big message for the audience, bring a whole lotta inspirational stuff but the plot was all over the place cause of all this preaching leading nowhere. Its comedy, tragic, musical, hopeful, inspirational and the list goes on just a mess of a rollercoaster. The preaching is just cringe and too much and when you think about it, it gets hypocritical. They wanted to fit so much into this movie but it didnt flow and work together, they didn't finish the ideas they started. No sort of development to be frank. Only good thing about this movie was Ryan gosling in his role of Ken, he carried the movie and did outstanding other than... dont waste money, energy, time like just dont go at all.\n",

      "Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.\n",

      "Very light spoilers.I didn't go into this movie thinking I would love it as much as I did. I went because I have 9 and 6 year old girls and especially the youngest loves Barbie. There were definitely jokes that were not appropriate for them but went right over their head, but they very much enjoyed the movie.The message was great and Ryan Gosling stole the show as a dopey Ken. Margot was great as Barbie, as were all of the actresses who played Barbies. I especially loved America Ferrera in her role! She was great.There were many times I cried in this movie because it's so on the nose about being a woman today, and it hit me hard having two young girls. I did not expect to shed any tears so that was a surprise!The reason I gave this an 8 instead of a 10 is because there were definitely some plot holes, like why Barbie had to bring America and her daughter to Barbie Land and what the very bad thing that would happen was (per the execs) by Barbie leaving the Barbie world. Many things weren't explained or didn't make much sense, but it was still a joy to watch.Overall I loved the movie and I'm so glad we went. All women should see this movie.\n",

      "This movie was a great way to redefine what Barbie stands for teenagers, and adults - as well. It was a great way to open up a thoughtful conversation with kids, and adults about common world problems.Nowadays, Barbie is held at a standard of just being pink, and girly, and frilly. But this movie did such a great job redefining it, showing how the barbie universe was so relatable in the most unlike of ways was mind-blowing.Aside from the movie addressing things like feminism, patriarchy, matriarchy, self-esteem, etc. Barbie brings up an array of positive character development traits throughout; one of the main, was how in the beginning of the movie - she was settled with her life and didn't want anything to change. And during the middle, didn't want to take any accountability or initiative when the Ken's took over. But, as the movie progressed, it didn't a great job of showing Barbie taking action, solving problems, AND making life changing decisions.There is so much good to address in the movie. For the people who didn't get the point of it, they HAVE to rewatch it with an open mind. Because there is so much to unpack in it; the cast, the music, the script.\n",

      "I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by \"mumblecore\" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.Instead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours, albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design. Watching empowered, millionaire actors, writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining, and I found it sad later to see all the excited little.girls waiting to see the next show, to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their Dads, sitting next to them in the screen!\n",

But the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film, the rest I never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time, The film didn't make any sense what so ever, besides from the first 30 minutes & the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophe.I have to praise Margot Robbie for her performance, despite the deplorable storyline, her acting was outstanding. On the other hand Ryan Gosling's acting/performance was cheap, cheesy, & overall cringeworthy. A massive shout out to Kate McKinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny, I love her originality.Overall not for me, as the storyline is atrociously written & didn't make sense.\n",

      "I think the significance of Barbie wasn't the fact that it was a fun, joyous, all around well movie. I felt everything. From the point being that women to this day hold such little power. You can't want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy. You need to show off but not too much. Nothing you'll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power. But along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that it's okay, you can be emotional and logical at the same time. It's okay to not know if what you're doing is right. I won't ever know if I was made to do what I want to do. Am I supposed to be an astronaut? Is that what my purpose is? I feel lazy when I see that everyone is out having amazing times and I'm stuck in the same continuous loop. Literally, everything that can make me me isn't actually me at all and the thought scares me. In our world, we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it. And this movie is the most beautiful way to showcase all of the world and what women truly do go through.\n",

It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to \"Free guy\" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can't complain.\n",

      "I should be the target audience. I am a woman in her thirties that grew up playing with Barbie dolls. Malibu barbie, Stacy, Skipper, Ken and the likes.But this movie failed on so many accounts. I cannot for the life of me understand what the message of this movie is/was. What am I take away from this?Kens have more fun? No, wait, Kens have all the fun. They can be as stupid as they want and still get really cool songs to sing? (Matchbox 20 is one of my alltime favourite bands - love me some Rob Thomas) They get to take over in 48 hours, not hard at all, because Barbies actually want to be submissive and they have an actual story arc (although kinda leaning into evil territory). That this movie could have had the title Ken - and Barbies do what... ?Barbies are what? Meant to be pretty and that's it? That is indeed what breaks this Barbie's (camels) neck. The fact that she isn't pretty anymore. And then we get this superficial \"women are so torn\" monolog in the middle of the movie that missed all the beats it was meant to hit. I am a woman. Was I meant to sympathise? It was a meaningless chain of words strung together to form more meaninglessness. Couldn't have perfect Barbie pulled herself up by her bootstraps? No, she needs the mom? With her superficial observations?The Barbie I grew up with was humble. She wouldn't have had this attitude of I know I am perfect, although she of course was. I was missing that too.But most of all, and I cannot emphasise how important that is: I hate that Barbie doesn't get to have any fun in this movie. I hate that she doesn't tell Ken in the end that she can't be the one responsible for his happiness. That he has to take responsibility for his own happiness. I hate that Ken is concerned with not having genitals in front of those real world workers. It shouldn't matter to him at this point in the movie (later on, okay), but even a genital-less Ken seems to be afraid of others thinking he has nothing in his pants.This is a minor quibble. But the ladies in the beginning that I want to call sturdier than any Barbie I've ever seen body wise... Were there ever such Barbies? I get that the movie wants to be inclusive, but I never got to play with overweight Barbie and I would have liked an explanation for their existence in Barbieland. Just one line would have sufficed.There's so much about this movie that doesn't sit well with me, but most of all - even on boring days my Barbies had way more fun than this stereotypical Barbie. She was having real adventures and that is something sorely missing from this movie. Which means I as the viewer had no real fun watching it. Instead I was trying to wrap my head around how nonesensical most of it felt to me.Like my header says - squandered potential.\n",

It started out fine but dragged in the middle. It became preachy. We know, we live it everyday. Mention patriarchy and move on. I thought it would have been nice to show both sides working together equally in the end. It might not have been realistic but we would have left the theater with a smile. I was not alone leaving the theater thinking what was that all about. I did not see too many children in the theater which was good because it would have been way over their head.\n",

After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw \"Let me show you\" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.\n",

It's up there with the first Lego Movie in heart, but almost feels like a maturer continuation of it. And thats not even getting into the visual aspects of it! From practical effects to the acting it was all top notch, visually engaging, and incredibly entertaining. To say i had tears at the end of it sounds embarrassing, but when the message. The visuals, and that score hit at the climax, the rush of feelings I got; The memories it unlocked; down to the thoughts if everything my wife's gone through and will go through... it was cathartic and heart wrenching all at the same time.

      "I watched this movie in the theater 9 weeks after its release. When the crowd of the Barbenheimer made its exit safely, it was time for me to move in, not dressed in pink -none of the 6 of us in the audience was- and watch it away from the hype.And boy was I grateful I did.Because the herds of my mid thirties, millennial peers that saw it before me, were hyped about the nostalgia of being a girl again. They also singlemindedly agreed that this movie is such a \"feel good movie\".And it is, if you ignore the sharp societal commentary, the self-criticism on mass consumerism and capitalist dogma our society is based upon, the sexes are seeking validation from, and at the end of the day, our relationship with ourselves and anyone around us is defined. Sure, womanhood and manhood are not deeply portrayed in this pink firework, after all, one of Ken's first lines is that pining whisper of \"i love you too\" whilst she waltzes off in her matriarchal utopia. After all, \" Thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved\".Gloria's monologue can easily go above your head if the pretty dresses and perfect hairdos are flashing in front of your eyes. It's understandable not wanting to listen to her sum of woman's existence in a couple of minutes, to the point that it felt like a knife to the gut and I was trying to control my sobs.I am sorry. This is not a feel good movie. Greta Gerwig is holding up a mirror to all of us and points the finger of accountability. This movie will age as a fine wine and it will be as timeless as Barbie's last line that defines the origins of us all.\n",

I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy.\n",

The stupid thing is when Barbie went to the real world she hated how there were a lot of males in leadership positions, even though in Barbie Land it is entirely run by females and then wonders why Ken wanted to change things in Barbie land when she felt the same way as ken in the real world. This lead to ken being the villain and no it was not Will Ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy. Then the really stupid thing comes at the end when she fights hard to change her home back into barbie land then decides to go and live in the real world which she hated because of the male dominance. Also the whole female don't have power thing is getting a bit old as these days there are strong powerful woman in successful leadership jobs.\n",

It's movies like this that will teach the young how unfair the world is and that's okay! The sooner we can help bring equality to the country, like it was made for, the sooner we can learn to help each other. I will say it's a shame Greta wasn't able to do things her way because I feel like it was very apparent how much the story changed midway, but either way It was a sweet message to every girl and their mothers, an acknowledgement to the struggles women face that men have little to no idea about.

      "It's a shame because I love Little Women and Lady Bird. Barbie did not serve.It's a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid. I'm agreeing with the latter, but the execution is just awful. The CEO and corporate people of Mattel started as a mock to men having all the top positions of a company, as the movie goes they're just there at the back of your mind and it's unpleasant experience because they did not do anything after. So many unnecessary scenes that could've been meaningful. For example, what's the scene Allan fighting other Kens for? There are so many seeds planted at once but none of them grew into their fullest potential. Here are some examples:1. The mother and daughter relationship: It started well, the daughter is disconnected with her mother. You thought the movie will revolve about fixing that problem? No. The daughter has no problem. She's just a teenager.2. Mother's longing for her daughter: The reason why barbie became curious about death is because the mother is playing with her barbie *differently*. She's drawing *weird* (sigh) Barbies. You thought it was because she had a rough childhood and now is the time to heal her inner child? No, she misses her time playing with her daughter. While it is an alright backstory, I see no reason how it is related to Barbie getting curious on death.3. Patriarchy: It's always shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses. The corporate people who are all men tries to catch Barbie so they can send her back to Barbieland. But barbie went to Barbieland and they STILL FOLLOWED HER. It took them too long to get there for no apparent reason. And when they get there it just gets very confusing. Why are they in there?4. Barbie wanting to be human: This should've been the theme of the movie. The point of the movie should've been about what Barbie saw to make her realize she wants to be human. But no, it was only a few minutes when she's seeing people laughing and some people are sad. After that, there was no more of it. They tried to push this in the ending but it just doesn't feel right because of the lack of motivation. Although it was expected. They wasted the whole time with cameos and other meaningless scenes.I am disappointed in this movie. It's not worth the hype.\n",

      "The film not only talks about the role of women in society, but also about how men are affected by the behavior and criticism of this repressed society full of hatred and misunderstanding. Both genders in real life suffer discrimination and minimization in labor fields, parental roles, etc. And this is something the movie makes mention of, but one has to be a bit more picky and watch the movie several times to understand the real message of the movie. About the humor, it's okay, but at times it can feel a bit fierce out of place, not to call it forced.About its music, the film has several pieces, but they're not able to shine, as well as the movie itself, and just a few like \"What was I made for\", or \"Dance the night away\" are remembered out of all the film has to offer.\n",

      "The most political movie I have ever watched. It is so confusing that you can't be sure what its target audience is. It looks like they wanted it to be profound, but putting too much 'woke' content made it boring and cringe. As a woman, I honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beings.Overall, 4/10 for good acting, good music, and good costumes.I went to watch this movie as I heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep. I was curious. And I walked out of the cinema hall wishing that this movie was that simple as expected.\n",

      "As someone who has been a fan of Barbie since I was a little girl, this movie was an incredible journey. The set was beautiful, the cast was great, and the soundtrack amazing. My favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively. It was achieved in a light hearted and caring way. The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish. In a world which does not always cater to women's needs, this film does a great job of holding us all accountable. We now live in a post-Barbie movie era, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds.\n",

      "I enjoyed the movie about how last time, kids used to play with barbie and showed how they would be like in real life. It also showed that how Barbie can be incharge of their own life in real life and not restricted with doing the same thing every day. Barbie is a very interesting movie, from dolls going to real life and actually expericing life. But it's kinda sad for them knowing that their world is very different from the real world, where men dominates and women works under the men. Overall, the movie was a very good movie and would highly recommend to watch, especially those who love barbie dolls.\n",

      "Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over \"what's feminine\" or \"what's masculine\" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).\n",

      "First off, I will look at the positive aspects. Margot played a beautiful Barbie. Not only was she pretty, her acting skills shined. However, I felt that the message conveyed here was poor, inappropriate, or unnecessary. I left the theater not feeling great about myself or the world. I did not enjoy how they had to put Ken down to make Barbie better, perhaps that is not what we should do, perhaps we should make everyone better.There were several clever references to pop culture that I thought were good. But perhaps they should have pop culture references that people seeing Barbie would like.\n",

      "I was told that I needed to go deeper than the narrative and the images. I tried, but it did not work. Each argument was so cheap and the forced superficiality, that I believe was required by the director, did not attract my buy-in. Even the finale with Mama Barbie came out so commercially, as did the self ironizing Mattel incorporation.So I will find other movies where Margot and Ryan's performance is far more notable.Final note: there is only one Barbie that would fit the role. Problem is that her performance would have killed the movie. But I still like her, which is bizarre: Paris Hilton.\n",

      "Although I had read varing opinions on the film, I hadn't bought into them too much as I didn't want anything to be spoiled. It isn't the standard kind of film i would watch but I found it fun, colourful and heart felt with a sad, honest but important undertone and message. I dont see how embracing Inclusivity, equality, femininity and respecting bodily and mental autonomy is a negative. I think this film will make certain people uncomfortable and easily confused as to the message it is trying to convey but I'm glad they didn't dumb it down for those particular audiences and were brave enough not to pander. My kids loved the film and it allowed for some discussion and reflection without breaking the fun vibe.\n",

      "So, the Barbie movie was \"meh\"There's been a ton of hype about the film's political bent and honestly, yes... the patriarchal nonsense is a bit heavy handed but that's not even what made it so bad.It was just dumb.It was too long and nonsensical and I really don't know how to sum it up other than that.I laughed a couple of times and one or two parts almost resonated with me, but then it just went from relatable to preachy and I just eyerolled so hard.It was mostly just boring and dumb, and that's disappointing because it looked great, the cast was great, and it had such potential to be a great self-aware meta comedy. It just failed so hard at doing that.My summary: Barbie gains sentience, fights the patriarchy, becomes a real girl, and goes to the gynecologist.This movie will NOT appeal to young kids.I can almost guarantee they'll find it boring.It's not a typical kids movie riddled with double entendres and over-their-heads adult humor. It's just adult humor and it's not even particularly funny (just my opinion).It absolutely looks amazing, it looks like it was made with kids in mind, it looks like a nostalgia trip for moms, and it looks like family fun.However... with the exception of looking amazing, it accomplishes none of that. (The Mario Movie did all of those things sooo much better in my opinion. THAT movie was darn near perfect.)If you wanna see Barbie, go for it. But if you're considering taking little kids I would not personally recommend it. 😘\n",

      "\"Barbie\" is a delightful film that successfully blends humor with a heartwarming message. The movie captures your attention with its witty moments and leaves you with a sense of positivity. The storyline, combined with the charming characters, draws you into Barbie's world and keeps you fully engaged throughout. While some aspects might be familiar, the film's unique twist and overall execution make it a standout. With its combination of humor and a touching message, \"Barbie\" earns a solid 8 out of 10 rating. It's a feel-good watch that's perfect for anyone seeking an enjoyable cinematic experience.\n",

      "I was excited to see this movie because I heard Gosling was so funny. It starts out very strong. The Kens are laugh out loud funny. Gosling steals every scene he is in. Robbie isn't bad but they wrote her character to be emotional and boring. In fact all of Barbies are boring in comparison to the kens. As the movie moves past barbieland it starts to struggle as the story develops. There are several scenes from this point on focusing on how Barbie (Robbie) must find out who she is essentially. These scenes drag on and kill any momentum the previous scene built. The movie rams against \"the patriarchy\" often. Ironically the funniest scenes involve the kens and how the patriarchy benefits them. Then Mattel comes into the story and that drags on. This movie should have been 20 minutes shorter and focused more on overcoming stereotypes, not condemning the patriarchy over and over. Legally Blonde is a superior movie in so many ways.\n",

It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig should be proud of herself and so should everyone involved in the making of Barbie because it was such a great film . I watched Barbie on the first day it came out and the cinema was packed, when it got to the scene where the Mum was telling the Barbie's what it's really like to be a woman the audience were clapping because they agreed and it creates such a lovely atmosphere that I've never been in or felt at the cinema . Many people who haven't watched the movie seem to have a problem with it because they think it's just about feminism when it's now because when the Barbie's eventually got there power back they didn't create a matriarchy like the Ken's creating a patriarchy but they found a way to live as close to equally as they could. Overall, Barbie is a great film and you should watch it no matter what anybody says because you will feel changed in a sort of way that you can't put into words after seeing it.\n",

But also how a person can get the intuition that it feels better to make a choice for another direction in one's life. The first steps in this new direction starts with a new physical sensation in your feet and emotional associations about getting older and dying in the end.

      "The opening scene parodying 21st Century a space oddacy was hilarious! I like it, clever. It's an idea dropped into the world which changed the society fundamentally. Babies be gone, professional dolls here we come!I suppose it's then interesting when Barbie does encounter the real world and finds it not to have changed. It does not represent the ideals they hold in the Barbie world which they thought had spread through the world creating a new reality. No, Barbie in the real world is just one idea in a sea of ideas.It's then fascinating to see Ken enter the real world. He finds out that Barbie is not the only idea that exists. There are others. However, instead of using this new information to find and build his own identity, he quickly discoveres the patriarchy.Using the pariachy as a tool to surpress and subordinate women in the world which women had built for themselves. His whole life he has believed that all that matters is Barbie and Barbie's world. He therefore returns to Barbieworld to use his new found power to dominate as a form of revenge. His obsession with Barbie has not dissappeard it has manifest in a new way. He is now taking revenge on himself in a way, as he acts out behaviours which serve him superficially, but don't actually nourish his soul, his true person. He's mimicking the Behavior or Barbie, trying to make her feel the way he felt. Toxic masculinity, and domination, it's an identity born out of pain and obsession.His story ach is the most simple to understand, he learns from Barbie that he can love himself. He can form his own identity which doesn't revolve around someone else. His identity can be one which is very personal to him and not one that exists to serve the needs of others or to impress others. He ends his obsession and idolization of Barbie and looks to love his friends, his Kens.Barbie existing in Barbieworld finds herself to be always happy, fully in love with herself and powerful in that love for herself she creates an entire world which functions beautifully, or so she believes.It's almost like Barbieworld is the internal personal world of an imagined player of the Barbie game. It's ordered and structured to produce good outputs. Mental stability. This sense of perfect is safe and change is not welcome. Why would Barbie ever want to change when Barbie is perfect.However, the real world, as Barbie later finds out, is messy and complex. We watch as the feelings, insecurities, and anziety of the Mother, Gloria, are spilled onto the page and into the world of Barbie.Barbie goes to \"weird Barbie\" who, she's is told, can cure her.Weird Barbie is the way that she is because some child decided they didn't want to be any of the Barbies that we're in offer and so created her own character in a rather chaotic manner. Weird Barbie is created out of emotional expression and therfore has the ability to feel her negative emotions.She offers Barbie the choice to go back to how things were before or to go on a mission to find the source of the problem. Barbie instantly chooses to revert back and not to address the problem. Barbie embodies a toxic positivity and fear of change which prevents her from accepting or noticing the problems within her reality and within the real world. Fear of change, fear of negative emotions.In later entering the human world she encounters lots of negativity which she doesn't know how to address, it's not in her programming it's not \"what I am made for\". Eventually, we see her sit looking out to the sea and look internally. In doing this she is able to access and feel her emotions. The fear, the insecurity, the anziety. She cries, turning to the old lady on the bench next to her she tells her she is beautiful. She has learned to see her fears, feel her feelings and feel awe at the beauty of an imperfect world.She's once again crushed by the daughter who tells her succinctly what she feels about Barbie as a tool of the patriarchy and capitalism.Barbie feels her feelings.Barbie had gone into the conversation with the goal of \"fixing\" the girl who'd gone rouge.She learns here that she can't fix the problems presented by the child because she can't even begin to understand them.Retreating back into uncertainty she willingly goes back to a figure of authority, Mattel, who say they can help get her back, home safe.In Mattel HQ she finds out that these men have no idea what they're doing. They want to put her back in the box, as if the world has not changed and she with it. She sees at the last moment that she can't go back, there was something rotten from the beginning and she can't go back in the box, she needs to figure out how to change it.She needs to figure out what she was made for.This new version of her. With the new feelings. She need to find her creator.Fortunately enough, she encounters her instantly.Her creator is the one who, when arriving back in Barbieworld, now Kenland, can effectively fight the idea of patriarchy that has infected the minds of the women.It's almost like Mettel are telling us that they are listening to the voices of those fighting the patriarchy and are making a commitment to change and be different in the making of this film.Barbie gets her story ach ending when she comes to peace with her fear of death. She accepts mortality. It's again as if Mattel are telling us, the idea of Barbie is not immortal and will die. And it may have died with this generation but we're adapting and ready to change.Barbie, the idea, the perfect Barbie. The perfect Margot Robbie ideal Barbie. The Ideal is not real. \"I was an Ideal, look so alive, turns out it's not real, what was I made for?\"The ideal must die.It would be beautiful if they discontinued the \"original\" Barbie doll after this film.The ideal never really exited.It's a slightly dissatisfying ending in a way because all of the power imbalances and structural patriarchal or matriarchal in the Barbie world ideas still persist.The fascist idiology as the daughter put it.The world of women in power is confined to an imaginary world and men remain dominant in Mattel and in the real world.We don't see a story arch for the society, as it never really changes. We're told in a way to accept that only incremental, tiny changes are allowed and large structural reform is pushed aside as unrealistic.\n",

I liked it more than I was anticipating. Great movie. The \"ask him about the Godfather\" was sending me. And the whole monologue about the contradictory expectations of womanhood, it was too relatable. Everything America Ferrera's character said, everything. The movie also touches on what it means to be a person, and the ending when Barbie decides she wants to experience what it's like to be human, it was also very touching. Also when Ken realises his idendity shouldn't revolve around Barbie. I don't give it a 10 cause I don't consider it perfect, but it's very close to it.\n",

I surprised that Barbie had a memory of her kid who used to play with her that she doesn't n't like anymore. So Ken takes over Barbie island while Barbie lies down on the floor like a toy. Barbie and the other girls makes the boys go to war. The old lady and Barbie thought about a little girl who loved playing with Barbie so much.\n",

      "Barbie starts off with a promising blend of satire and clever dialogue, but as the story transitions into the real world, the film becomes tiresome and less captivating. Like oil and water, it attempts to provide entertainment but is hindered by heavy-handed messages. It is not your typical children's film; instead, it feels more like a production geared towards teenagers, laden with political propaganda and mockery of traditional values.The film seems intent on conveying a manifesto against a cruel and unrealistic reality while addressing the existential crisis faced by women. However, for male viewers like myself, the film feels peculiar and confusing due to its irrelevant and comical political undertones.It also appears to take on the role of a feminist campaign, attempting to portray women as equal to men through ironic and puzzling means. Unfortunately, some of the intended messages get lost in translation and lack proper delivery. The perplexing ending, where Barbie's creator claims she can choose her destiny, as if referring to a tragedy as a gift, only adds to the overall confusion and lack of clarity regarding Barbie's origins.Perhaps with the addition of more appropriate dialogue, this plastic doll movie could have been an enjoyable watch, instead of morphing into a misguided attempt to indoctrinate children with politics.\n",

      "I think everybody should watch this movie. This movie will change someones perspective of the world. If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year. She even broke box office record for female directors. LOVE BARBIE AND EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "The Barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot, but was overall a hilarious movie to watch. While many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men, they are looking at it the wrong way, they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them, all while keeping the Barbie theme at the heart of the plot. It addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is, a patriarchy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in \"powerful\" positions in society.\n",

I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!\n",

      "I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well.\n",

      "Grandiose movie: colourful, lovingly staged, entertaining, definitely strange but never trashy. The actors are brilliant, the dialogue to the point and the set design fantastic. It had everything: I laughed, I was thoughtful, I cried. My husband was also thrilled. Great cinema has been achieved here, from which everyone can certainly take something away, whether they are Barbie fans or not. I was excited to see the film because of the director and for me Greta Gerwig's masterful skills have been confirmed. Thank you for 114 minutes of escapism without ever losing sight of reality. For me, the best film so far in 2023.\n",

      "The movie is amazing, Margot Robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a Truman show vibe for me , Ryan Gosling is amazing as Ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles. However, I feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that aren't specific to feminism. Overall, I do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about Barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie. For example, if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative. In conclusion, I feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 7.8 for me personally at least a 8.5 or higher therefore I have decided to put 10/10 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly.\n",

      "This movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly. It turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess. It wasnt funny or entertaining. Any hope for entertainment was lost immediately. Any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators. The fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me. Yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is, however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact. Instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie.\n",

      "The whole movie is a gentle punch of love covered in perfect pink. You don't have to be perfect, you are who you are, and your existence itself shall be of intrinsic value.Barbie was created to be a playmate for girls, inspiring them to grow and become outstanding and successful women in all walks of life.But in the real world, Barbie found that she had not fulfilled her mission at all. Her perfect body and appearance caused women body anxiety and appearance anxiety. Served as an accomplice to the objectification of women, she has been sugar-coated by capitalism to be propaganda for consumerism and unrealistic physical ideas, destroyed growth of innate sense of worth and has set the equal rights movement back 50 years.Barbie fell into a deep existential crisis, \"If I can't fulfill my mission, what is the meaning of my existence?\"\n",
      "The answer given by the director comes from a place of love: \"Your existence itself has intrinsic value, you don't have to earn it, and you have every right to define the meaning of your existence.\"When I looked at the QQ Music Original Soundtrack comment section, I realized that many audience have been moved to tears, so was I especially during below parts:1. A conversation between Barbie and an old woman on a bench at a bus stop.In the world where Barbie lives, there is no aging or death, and everyone is always young and exquisite. When she came to the real world, she met an old lady, and for the first time she looked at this face full of wrinkles, and said sincerely, \" You are beautiful\", which represents her acceptance of aging and the imperfect being of the world, and also represents she has been able to make her own definition of beauty for the very first time ever, and this is the first step for her innate sense of self to emerge.For a long time, in the perfect Barbieland/narratives of consumerism, only perfect and exquisite high heels and clothes, slim and graceful figure and face, decent residence and cars and luxurious parties are beauty. But this time, Barbie defines beauty in a different way by herself.Only when she truly accepts herself, the self who doesn't like high heels, has cellulite on her legs, will age and die, will be confused and sad, can she truly accept the outside world and other people without criticism. And only by true acceptance of the world, other people and herself, one can generate genuine respect. Only then can she look at the old grand lady's hunched back and wrinkled face, and still think it is beautiful.In my opinion, apart from aging, sickness and death, all other worries in life are merely a matter of values, but aging, sickness and death have no solution. Being able to reconcile with aging is not only the calmness of watching one's vitality disappear little by little, but also the courage to face the countdown to death, and the courage to accept this helplessness and cherish every minute of life even more.This reminds me of a related story. Long, long ago, in a faraway land, a king received a prophecy that his son would either become the greatest king ever lived in history or become an unprecedented spiritual leader. The king thought of the thin, poor and sloppy practitioners wandering around he has seen in the past, and was very afraid that his son would abandon the road of ruling and become such, so he built an exquisite, luxurious and enclosed pavilion for him, a walled garden of earthly delights and endless enjoyment. Only the healthy, the young and the happy were allowed inside. Immersed in the pleasures of senses, the prince came of age, protected from the limitations of mortal being and signs of decay and aging. But one day the prince grew curious of outside and wanted to travel outside. So the king ordered all the elderly, sick or dying people to hide at home during the prince's visit. But during his visit outside, God deliberately sent an old man to hobble alongside the road and appeared in the prince's sight. The prince saw an old man for the first time, realized the existence of aging for the first time, and the world and the paradise he once knew collapsed upon him. Then he ran back to his palace with shock and despair. Just like children, when they encountered troubles outside, were bullied, they'd run home to let their parents solve the problem, but this time, no one's parents couldn't solve this trouble, not even if his father was the king of the whole universe, he still could not protect his son from the knowledge of mortality. Later, in order to free the world from the suffering of life, aging, sickness and death, the prince resolutely abandoned everything and embarked on the road of no return. After going through all kinds of hardships and dangers, he finally nirvana and became an unprecedented spiritual leader.2. Barbie observed the environment in the park on the bench alone and felt the strong and various emotions of human beings for the first time. The warmth of sunlight, the mottled tree shadows, and the gentle breeze of wind. Barbie shed a tear. Cause before this, she had never felt these emotions, now she has felt what it was like to be alive for the very first time.The human world is not only filles with happiness, but also anxiety, sadness, and helplessness. But it's all those lows that make those happy moments all the more precious.3. Warmth of your gaze:Ken was created as an accessory to Barbie, who would always stand on the beach waiting for Barbie to say hello to him. He has no home, no friends, no job, no ideals, no ego. Ken symbolizes lovestruck girls who lost their sense of self. He projects the ideals and the fantasies of the best qualities a person can have onto a specific person who he does not know yet, making this person an ever-judging God. For him, only when Barbie's eyes are on him, is he happy. Barbie's rejection has validated his miserable existence. But this is not true love. This is why when Barbie said to Ken, \"you must discover who you are without me\", this feels so warm, it's the movie's gentle message to all girls who are deeply troubled by love to find their self again.It's not Barbie and Ken\n",
      "It's not Ken and Barbie\n",
      "It's Barbie and it's Ken4. At the end, the conversation between Barbie and the founder Ruth is like a kid and a benevolent old mother. The background music of \"What was I made for\" only made it harder to hold my tears. For those who have been or are looking for the meaning of life, this scene would strike you. \"You created me, don't you control me? Don't I need your permission to be a human?\" If there's higher existence who created us, does he hope to give us complete freedom to choose our beliefs, our values, our actions? And by freedom, I mean, he does not rely on miracles, or bread, or promises of heaven to lure us, to guide us, but to allow us to choose completely freely. And can we afford the heavy burdens of this freedom? So many people couldn't bear it and choose various biased ideologies to get rid of the pain of independent thinking, to get rid of the loneliness of finding meaning in the context of nihilism.In the end, Barbie's ending is also the most inspiring story ending ever, because she didn't choose to stay in Eden-like Barbieland, but chose to become a real human. Seeing that the human world is imperfect, is filled with anxiety and sadness, aging and death, she still chooses this path. Because what she wants is an adventure, so compelling that the pain and suffering of life, as well as the aging and death, would all become worthwhile. Only in this way can she feel her own existence-no longer a manufactured thing, but the creator of her own destiny, the definer of her own meaning.Humans only have one ending, but ideas flew forever.And Barbie has no ending.\n",

      "The movie was unexpectedly fun starting from all the references related to the actual Barbie doll to the costumes and till even the Barbie world itself. Overall I think there is a good balance between satire and sincerity, crammed with impeccable attention to details. Even tough as a watcher I expected Barbie to be the star of the show, in many moments Ken was actually such a fun scene-stealer that at one point I felt the movie should truly be Barbie and Ken.I could totally agree to the fact that the movie is a riotous, candy colored feminist fable and it's true that Barbie does many of the things we've been promised: there is much mocking and loving of Barbie, and plenty of costumes but none of those things make it subversive. From my point of view it's a movie that enormously pleased with itself but even tough it's very pretty it's not that very deep.\n",

      "This movie had so much potential!! It was doing so well for a while, it was funny and clever and had depth and I was super excited to see where it was going to go, but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent (even problematic) conclusion. I'm almost angry at it. Even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds, making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them die.Btw it's definitely not for under 12s. There is nothing inappropriate in it, so they could technically watch it for the visual aspect, they just wouldn't understand much.------ SPOILERS ------Some of the elements where the movie deeply disappointed me are below. Please don't read any further if you haven't watched the film yet and want these elements to be a surprise.Ken's development:Ken realises that men aren't treated as equals in Barbieland, and creates his own patriarchy, which in the end the Barbies tear down. When Ken bursts into tears thinking that he will have to go back to a life where he is oppressed - that could have been developed and executed so beautifully! Barbie even told him it's ok to cry. This could have moved towards all Kens understanding that they need to express their vulnerable emotions in order to not be angry and toxic, and the Barbies need to stop the oppression of men because it's just as bad as oppressing anyone, and it could have led to equality in Barbieland! But no. Turns out Ken is in fact crying because he has an unhealthy, anxious attachment to Barbie and his ego can't take the news that Barbie is not 'in love' with him. And then the movie concludes with Ken agreeing to explore who he is individually without Barbie (this would be an ok conclusion if it wasn't for abandoning all the other deeper seeds planted before), with some other Kens getting middle management jobs in the (once again) matriarchal Barbieland society, but not leadership positions, 'the same way it is for women in the real world'. Seriously? It's like this was written by men. The Barbies are going for revenge??Barbie's development:Barbie wants to be human, and again this could have been developed with emotional and intellectual depth, and there is an attempt at the beginning to show the reason Barbie started to have these thoughts, where she is seeing humans express all these complex emotions, and she's seeing the beauty of the world around her in all those small magical details in nature that feel more intense than usual, but then this thread is dropped completely, so much so that in the end when Barbie is asking to be human, it doesn't make sense why, and the narrator has to literally do a voiceover speech to explain it (badly). And then when she is finally human, her first (and very overhyped) trip is to the gynaecologist, implying that what she's most excited about being human is having a vagina. Again, written by men?? This movie is literally setting women back 50 years.Development of the mother - daughter relationship:Not much to say other than how shallow this remains despite setting it up as if it was going to go somewhere. Barbie goes to the real world to find this teenage girl whose emotions are causing her to malfunction (the malfunctioning focused on cellulite which is a whole other horror story!) It then turns out it's actually the girl's mum who is playing with Barbie and feeling these emotions because her life isn't fun and her daughter is hostile with her. And then at some point out of nowhere the mother and daughter start hugging and smiling at each other. That's it. We're not going into why she was hostile in the first place and why she isn't any more (teenagers are not hostile for no reason), we're not touching on why the mum was feeling that way and what made her not feel that way any more (it clearly wasn't just her daughter). But everything is suddenly fine now. Oh ok then.Allan:This is so chaotic, I don't even know where to start. So he has a particularly sensitive / gay / queer vibe, and I think they are trying to make him into a hero (like he fights a bunch of Kens for no apparent reason - they really could have used that scene for something else), but the point of him is unclear. He's an ally to the Barbies, and there's only one of him (which I always think is actually a bit problematic, to have only one token representative of the LGBTQ+ community in a film; although I get that in real life Mattel didn't have that much diversity and they were trying to stay true to that). His motivation siding with the Barbies in the patriarchy seems to be the fact that he feels invisible too, but the movie doesn't go into this at all, and kind of ignores him the same way the characters do. Like he's a hero simply by being different from the Kens and helping the Barbies, but how he feels throughout this, and what he gets out of it in the end, if anything, is anyone's guess. It's not clear whether or how things change for him at all. They don't seem to, despite all the effort.'Weird' Barbie:When Barbies are played with too hard, they turn 'weird' - strange make up and clothes, cut and messed up hair, always in splits. So far, very funny. But why does 'Weird' Barbie remain perceived weird throughout?? Why doesn't anyone realise that she is just as beautiful still as the other Barbies, despite her unusual hair and make-up and non-perfection, or why doesn't anyone realise that she basically saves Barbieland, and it doesn't matter in the slightest what she looks like, she's a hero? Thanks for making all girls who are unusual-looking or not stereotypically beautiful and perfect feel like freaks.Especially because of 'Weird' Barbie and Allan, the movie's 'diversity' just feels so forced.The board of Mattel (all real world men who are painfully stupid):With Will Farrell as CEO. First of all, what was funny 20 years ago is not really funny any more. Will Farrell should only be in this if there is some clear development of the narrative behind his behaviour. But there isn't. It's all a bit of a mess. We get a kick out of the mockery of foolish men at the beginning, but they are still in power regardless of anything. They are trying to put Barbie back in a box but she escapes (another missed opportunity - what would have happened if she goes in the box?), then they chase her into Barbieland for no reason (they wanted her to go back, she goes back, so why don't they just celebrate and stay where they are?), and then there's literally no point of them being there. Was casting Will Farrell just an attempt to get middle aged toxic men into the cinema?The cellulite issue:Barbie agrees to go to the real world so that she doesn't get cellulite. Literally. I do understand sarcasm and I get that this would be quite funny IF we as a society were beyond that already and IF there weren't any teenage girls watching but the film is a 12 and the beauty industry is making more money out of women's insecurities now than ever. If we're going to use sarcasm here, this needs to be addressed later, for example Barbie realising that it's our uniqueness that makes us beautiful (they really missed an opportunity using 'Weird' Barbie to drive that message) and cellulite doesn't matter, but no such thing - the movie concludes with the message that cellulite is indeed a malfunction. This has got to have been written by men.Apparently the only man involved in the screenplay was Noah Baumbach. Ah, co-produced by Mattel. Of course. All the male Mattel executives must have had a say. Now it makes sense. The movie is fun to watch and it's certainly witty, especially in the first half, and I really liked the performances and visuals. There seems to have been strong intention of depth and the movie is very political but ultimately fails to convey the right message and all it ends up being is a clever brand extension to make more money for Mattel.\n",

      "This is the kind of movie I want my teenage daughter to grow up watching. To get to know and appreciate the flaws, strengths, and weaknesses that come with being a woman, whatever it is, 'Because Barbie can be anything, WE can be anything'.I expected the movie Barbie to be about the origin of Barbie or about Barbie's adventures like most other Barbie animated movies, but it turned out to be much more than that. It really explores the value of empowering women, which is typical of Greta Gerwig.I really enjoyed the first half of the film, mainly because of the beautiful scenery, colorful colors, and Barbieland. I was also surprised by how gorgeous Margot Robbie looks as Barbie, and the costumes and set designs are so beautiful. As the movie progresses, I realized that this movie will become more profound and emotional, and Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken, handsome, funny, and energetic. Even though Ken is \"Kenough,\" the film does not ignore the role of men, and we love Allan. The movie is a bit dull at times, and some of the jokes are cringey, but it's still enjoyable to watch to the end.I think the best part of the movie is the ending, when Barbie talks to Ruth in a really meaningful way. It's really touching and uplifting, with a really thoughtful message about womanhood and self-love.Barbie (2023) might not be perfect and it might not be everyone's favorite, but hey, nothing's perfect, right?-@fineapplespov.\n",

However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous.

I thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal, not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society, like why does the male gender not own houses, why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account, and it the end, they still don't get houses? Also this is a misrepresentation of the real world, as a woman with a career and decent income, I can tell you I in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues. Instead of portaying equality, the movie ends on a note where the male species is dumb and still not on equal footing. Disappointing.\n",

      "I really liked this film it is a pretty sensitive topic in a land of fun and rainbows I think it got the message through but had just the right amount of humor it also had a lot of great acting g from Ryan gosling and Margot Robbie I really like this film it's great for Adults and for kids even if the topic flies over their heads although I don't think the acting and the screenplay is all flawless I think there are some things they could've done to make it better for example in one scene when Barbie was in her car driving to the \"real world\" it was really glitch in choppy at least for my theater but I don't think that was intentional.-Great film overall 8.5/10.\n",

      "I think Greta Gerwig perfectly threaded the needle between astute social commentary on Barbie, and a love letter to the doll that shaped America. It is a campy oasis in the midst of an industry that seems to increasingly worship somber realism. It has all the charm of an 80s cult classic, on a 2023 budget. Alongside hilarious writing that made my cheeks hurt by the end, is incredible set and costume design, and standout acting performances from a remarkably cohesive cast. There are also subtle details I really appreciated like Barbie's car being a 1959 corvette, the same year the doll was released. I'll knock one star off because in a few moments towards the end, the plot gets lost in itself, and it feels like they are speaking in riddles.\n",

      "Really good soundtracks and amazing cast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were incredible. The jokes were funny too. I also liked the little details in the movie, like Barbie's iconic clothes, or the matrix reference back with weird barbie. But the story and overall everything wasn't as exceptionally good and enjoyable as everybody promises, especially if we compare it to the quantity of hype and advertising it got. Also, I wasn't, and I'm still not sure what audiences it is for. Sure, they say \"It's for everybody\", but no, I don't think it's for everybody. Shortly, worth to watch, but definitely not a Godfather.\n",

      "I loved the mix of already existing songs and customed songs for this movie. I adored Billie Eilishs song What Was I Made For, it was so touching.The fighting scene with all the Kens at the beach was ridiculously amazing, and Ryan Gosling has never looked better, hehe. I loved the choreography in that big space with blue and pink, Ken Can. Music was 10/10.Emotion...\n",
      "When Barbie saw what the real world was like I felt tears running down my face, I was so hurt by the truth. I mean, not even in this Barbie movie, we can forget about the unfair world for women. But without it, the movie wouldn't be as great.A big part of the movie was emotional and I thought that was great. When they talked about death, I really felt it.Overall, the movie was way more than I thought it would be and I definitely recommend it. The humor isn't hilarious but I chuckled when jokes were relatable.\n",

      "The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff.\n",

      "I never had high expectations for the film due to the number of just-okay films that have come out this past year, but Greta never disappoints- Lady Bird, Little Women, and now Barbie! The movie is surely a Gerwig classic. It is amazing how the outright un-serious, campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated real-world issues. Naturally, there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach. The writing carried witty humor, strong character development, and heartfelt experiences- all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances. Margot Robbie's performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling's Ken. (SPOILERS) It is clear that everything Ken has done to Barbieland (\"bringing patriarchy\") was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth, what he feels he often lacks in Barbieland. The film features a multitude of well-known actors that portray a great deal of what a Barbie can be. The set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a Barbie dream house (and her clothes) were extremely coveted by young girls. On the other hand, it shows how Barbieland is not all it is thought out to be. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old Hollywood sound-stage musicals that we never really see anymore. This film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to America Ferrera's performance. Her monologue's feminist themes are reminiscent of Saorise Ronan's monologue from Little Women. It was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity, resonating with audiences. While the message is not at all new, many women especially feel heard. The film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up- the simultaneous laughing and crying sort. Overall, \"Barbie\" is a fun, glittery, social commentary satire about female identity; the feminism of hyperfemininity, authenticity, and community; and what it means to be human in our messed-up, chaotic world. For the Gerwig fans, Barbie lovers, Barbie haters, and everyone else, go watch Barbie.\n",

      "I watched the Barbie movie last night. Overall I would say that it's a very creative dare I say, outstanding, movie. The premise is brilliant albeit kind of uncomfortable with its generalization of gender roles and what I'd like to think were hyperbolic stereotypes. But, I am a guy and I definitely have my blind spots as many know. However I do try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. After all I do have many capable and strong women in my life that I'm concerned whether they get treated fairly.But, despite these slightly unsettling misgivings it's a really funny movie. The mixed animation and live action is remarkable and many of the characters are really well written. That is aside from the male characters; they're all pretty much one dimensional dullards who generally can't get out of their own way. Thus it's a mix of humorous social commentary with keystone cop slapstick. But it's so visually rich it's like a cinematic ice cream sundae.Margot Robbie was made for this role. Her performance was a combination of sweet naivete and compelling poignancy. And she looks like a Barbie. That's remarkable. Many of the other \"Barbie\" dolls were performed excellently as well. Kate McKinnon is really funny in it even though it seemed at times she was adlib/riffing a la SNL with one eye on the audience, but she's very good as the bad(?) Barbie. I was surprised and pleased to see John Cena make an appearance or two as the Neptune Ken; that was pretty funny.Both Ryan Gosling and Simon Liu were good as Ken and . . . Well, Ken. Their characters actually had a little depth to them which allowed them to grow (a little) over the course of the story. America Ferrera is a good actor and she was solid but not compelling. For my taste her climatic speech(es) were heavy-handed but they did serve a story development purpose.So, in short I really enjoyed the movie. It was visually compelling and much of the acting outstanding. While the story may rankle some OGs out there, for anyone who was/is married or has a daughter or a sister or a mother (I guess that's everyone) they know that women often times have suffered from gender bigotry and so being sympathetic to that I think they'll find it is a really good movie. And there's probably nothing wrong with being reminded of that struggle now and then.Oh, and the music. It's got a great soundtrack. And the final song \"What Was I Made For?\" written by both Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell and sung by Billie stopped me in my tracks. What a well written song that was so apropos and memorable.\n",

      "I loved Barbie as a child, so when my teenage daughter wanted to go see it at the premiere, I was on!The movie started out great, and I really enjoyed the first part with all the funny details, and I loved that they made sure to also include a lot of the most hilarious discontinued Barbie products.The silly and perfect take on barbieland with the amazing actress Margot Robbie playing \"stereotypical barbie\" was hitting ALL the right notes, and I couldn't wait till she was introduced to the hard reality of the \"real world\".Sadly this is where the innovative and creative vibe ends, as the \"real world\" is just as (if not even more) silly and unrealistic than Barbieland - presenting an extreme reality where unintelligent powerhungry men completely run the world and not one single women is able the have any job of significance.Making the entire thing even worse, atleast the last 45 mins of the movie is the morale of.. well.. everything..To be honest ive never been a big fan of Ryan Gosling, and sadly his role as \"Ken\" didn't help. It wasn't really funny, just sad, and the big moment when the barbies was fighting back wasn't really him realising he was wrong, just that him and the other \"Kens\" couldn't really do anything about the fact that the women had taken over barbieland, and they just gave up?All in all \"Barbie\" was a great idea, with a great cast, and it's obvious that they had done their homework when it came to the history of barbie. Sadly it ended up as quite a mess, as the story didn't make any sense - leaving me with a lot of questions.\n",

      "Ah, the Barbie doll-a cultural icon that has been both revered and reviled, often in the same breath. The 2023 film \"Barbie\" takes us on a whimsical yet poignant journey through the plastic corridors of Barbieland, a realm that mirrors our own societal norms and prejudices in a way that is both amusing and unsettling.The film opens in a utopia of sorts, where Barbies hold esteemed positions and Kens are relegated to the beach. But all is not well in paradise. Barbie, our protagonist, is plagued by an existential crisis that leads her on a quest for self-discovery, accompanied by her ever-loyal Ken. Ah, the follies of youth, even for a doll that never ages!The narrative takes a dark turn when Barbie and Ken venture into the real world, confronting issues of body image, gender roles, and corporate greed. The film doesn't shy away from tackling these heavy subjects, and it does so with a deft touch that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The days of \"Rebel Without a Cause\" may be long gone, but the angst of youth remains evergreen.The character of Weird Barbie serves as a delightful foil to our heroine, embodying the societal outcasts who often possess the most wisdom. Her role in Barbie's awakening is crucial, providing a counterpoint to the superficial world from which she hails.However, the film's most striking moment comes when Barbie meets the spirit of Ruth Handler, the real-life creator of the Barbie doll. This meta-conversation serves as a reminder that even the most seemingly trivial of objects can have a profound impact on our lives and culture. It's akin to a modern-day \"Wizard of Oz,\" where the man behind the curtain is actually a woman.The film concludes on a hopeful note, with Barbie and her plastic compatriots embarking on a journey of self-improvement and societal change. It's a fitting end to a film that challenges our preconceptions at every turn.\n",

      "I retract my statement, the movie wasn't even whole sixty seconds of good... They were changing concepts every 15 minutes... That is absolutely no message in the movie. All in all, instead of me feel good movie, it was a total field confusion, hatred, stupidity and overall annoying. Ken being portrayed in a bad light was stupid. Showing that the owners are the creators of Barbie were morons who didn't know what was happening is was absolutely stupid. Showing that old lady Outta nowhere was stupid. And come on mid life crisis of a foolish lady mixed with villian Ken like what were they getting at.You'd question your decision that lead to watching this movie and how much are we as a society influenced by advertising. Honestly it doesn't give you anything, no lesson, no entertainment, no nothing.. in fact it's take away your time and money and sence of appreciation for Barbie as a concept.\n",

      "Greta Gerwig brings the fun to the well known toy of generations, Barbie. Based on the trailers and interviews my hopes were high that it was going to be a fun and campy ride in the Barbie mobile. I would say it hit a few speed bumps. Women empowerment and understanding Barbie was spot on. Bringing in the discontinued dolls and ideas was brilliant. I feel the Kens' storyline was were the potholes were. Why can't it be Barbie's world and not so strong on a beating over the head that Ken is nothing. That Ken's only recourse is to take over? That Ken in the end, still isn't supporting Barbie as it should be. That might be controversial and some might say I missed the point, but I want my son to see it and come away with equality not that he should be diminished. If we want equality we need to model what a supportive boy/man should be. Partnership anybody?\n",

      "After months of seeing teasers and trending expectations about Barbie, I walked into the movie theater with my Dad not knowing what to expect.The movie began fun and easy-going , and it was exciting to see Margot and Ryan in such entertaining roles. The first things that catch the eye are the colorful details in the scenes and catchy jokes and phrases, until Barbie and Ken enter the real world.The rest of the movie seemed like waves of different atmospheres. The first scene that had an impact on me was when Barbie, after recognizing her owner, sits at the bus stop and meets the elderly woman. The dialogue was really short, yet had an impact on me and made me feel connected to the movie as a young woman.After adventures both in the real and the Barbie world, another scene that makes a big statement in the movie is America Ferrera's monologue about what women face. Now, both me and my dad don't get impressed to easily, and we are quite critical. But my heart began beating so fast with every word she said, and as soon as the monologue ended , my dad started clapping, and so did the whole theater. It was a beautiful moment.And after a combination of hilarious moments and meaningful conversations, came the climax of the movie, which I did not expect. Barbie meets her creator. This scene completely isolated the two characters from the rest of the movie. They share an unforgettable conversation, as Billie's soundtrack \"What Was I Made For?\" begins playing. This is when my heart began fluttering, and I felt so still. Tears rolled out of my eyes before I even knew it, the room was silent. A movie hasn't made me cry in a long time, and this felt like a release of emotion I couldn't control.However, this is not quite the ending. The ending scene shows Barbie, now in the real world, completing an activity women do (you'll understand once you watch the movie) and the movie hilariously ends with Nicki Minaj's song.When it came to an end, I really needed a moment to process what I've just seen. It felt like a big part of my childhood and my girlhood has been acknowledged, and I've never felt a feeling like this before. I can now imagine myself in the future, showing this movie to my future daughter. In my opinion, this is a must-watch for all women. You will not regret it.\n",

I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays.

We sympathise with them throughout the movie and the message is about equal rights for women. But feminism is about equal rights for everyone! Ken's deserve their freedom too.

I don't agree with Criticism that it was a commercial for Mattel since they clearly gave Greta final edit. Really don't can't think of a bad thing to say.

If you like comedy watch the trailer, its not just a highlights reel, it is the enitrely of anything amsuing in the whole film.

It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that.

People must be hard up for light-hearted fun, and too bad that Barbie didn't serve that up. Unfortunately, it was less of a movie and more of a two-hour Mattel commercial. And the movie delves into heavy-handed politics that other (serious) films have done much better. Serving up feminism, hyper-masculinity, misogyny and BEACHING you over the head with it was not only disappointing but was it misleading and misappropriated. It wasn't the movie I wanted to see, but it did have some bright moments especially with Kate McKinnon and Ariana Greenblatt. The weirdness factor was on a scale of 10, and I can only rate the movie at a 5 stars, but I do give Ryan Gosling's chest a 10...it was the only constant in the film, along with the prettiness of Margot Robbie.\n",

The beginning was hopeful and I loved the cast and the amazing set of Barbie Land. Barbie's playhouse was amazing! But as it went on, it became way too political and preachy and went downhill. If I did this movie, I would have made it a love story between Ken and Barbie and had them get married, making use of all the cool Barbie toys and her friends. But of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect, even though that's what most people still do these days.

No resolve was ever made to the story which leaves. We have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good, but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before. Politics aside, this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess. One positive is the set design and costumes were amazing.

The social representation of the main characters is disappointing, belittling both the female and male gender on many occasions and with a slightly distorted conceptualization of common thinking. In relation to the characters, one or the other rescues the development of the film due to its trajectory on the big screen, but nothing exceptional. This is without a doubt a film that I would not see again on any given Sunday while I rest; Even if I'm being honest, it's on my list of the worst movies I've seen in my last 15 years, but be the witness yourself.

      "Spoilers (sort of)Barbie is something most of us grew up around in some form of fashion whether we played with them with our sisters, stole them when she wasn't looking, or hated them and stuck to our Hot Wheels and Gi Joe's. In this instance, Barbie is not the same Barbie we played with but a woman who is comfortable with complacency and is forced to fight the patriarchy while also find her purpose.From the set, to the costumes, Barbie did a wonderful job of bringing us into the world of Barbieland and reminding us of what the houses and cars used to look like (and how she was just a little too big for everything). Sure there was some dialogue that was aloof and in need of some reworking, and Ken's character was multi faceted ? But nontheless, it had a powerful two fold message to deliver.Barbie is a film that has been so hyped up by the public and it's duality of opening at the same time as Oppenheimer that you can't help but want to see it to stay in the cultural loop. At the same time, Barbie takes what should have been an entirely superficial script and goes just below the surface to remind us of our humanity, the world we built, and our opportunity for self determination. Personally, I think this was a brilliant way to engage moviegoers and a great way to disembark from the surface level franchise films many of us are accustomed to watching. It's comedic and relevant quips and nods entertained while it's double message challenged audiences to think critically about our world and their own places in it.While I am not surprised by the out of place moments (this is a Hollywood movie after all), I was pleasantly taken back by the journey we went on with stereotypical Barbie and her discovery of what it means to have free will. I highly suggest seeing this at least once, and with your mom if you can.\n",

      "With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.\n",

      "This movie was wonderful. I went in with lowered expectations because I find the majority of big movies don't live up their hype. This was not the case here. Beautiful acting and message without being too pushy. It was very accessible; it didn't pander, and it didn't condescend. The dialogue felt very real and not scripted. SO much fun and tons of funny moments. The only thing I questioned was why the montage at the end didn't include some of the pain and sad moments of human existence. It sort of made Ruth saying \"I can't in good conscience...\" a strange thing to include. I'm hoping this will maybe make it into an expanded version?\n",

It transfers us to whole new magical world and you will enjoy every single second of it while makes us relate to ourselves and our real world problems, emotions and situations. Filled with powerful performances and soundtracks. A instant classy, Must Watch. Margot Robbie owns the role Barbie. She lives the character. Ryan as Ken is so great. He does really steals the show sometimes. All the others supporting characters and human characters are so good and fun too.Barbie movie really respects it's roots and pays a beautiful tribute to all Barbie dolls and it's creators.\n",

      "I wasn't expecting much from this movie and being honest I thought it was weird that Barbie of all things was getting a live action movie nonetheless I still wanted to give this movie a chance since i used to watch the animated movies as a kid with my sister. Upon finally getting to watch it I would have to say it's pretty boring.Barbie starts off fairly well but like nearly half way through I loose interest in watching it. The idea of Barbie having an existential crisis is a great idea and I think the first half of the movie did a good job at that however it kind of lost its edge the longer the movie went on. Margot Robbie plays Barbie wonderfully and is honestly the best thing about the movie (second being Michael Cera and third being John Cena). I some what liked Ken too because he had a fair share of good moments in the movie.Overall Barbie is a fairly okay movie but honestly it doesn't live up to the hype.\n",

      "The movie did some real weird worldbuilding where none of the rules were consistent. I had to keep reminding myself that barbieland was made by men, therefore barbieland is not an exact opposite of the real world - it's a rendering of what \"men\" think female utopia is. But it wasn't a direct opposite of real world either. I doubt many viewers will actually be able to internalize that as part of the lore.The parallel between realworld and barbieland just didn't make sense therefore it felt like a plot fail. If barbies are all important unlike women in the real world, where does Ken swooning over Barbie land on on that real world spectrum?Im just going to say, the fact that Barbie has 0 complex feelings until the lady from the real world played with her, but Ken was aware of being unhappy WHILE being not a person but an accessory to Barbie is the kind of double crossing i didn't expect. I was confused about which point it tried proving.Ryan Gosling has a real chance to become an icon for incels after this performance. He gets rejected, creates an ultramasculine society, and at the end Barbie apologises to him and he rebrands? He was a villain and did not get a redemption arc. He shouldn't even be sentient in this universe as much as he is. I expected Barbie to be honest with him and say she just doesn't love him, or that she wasn't made to have those feelings to him because Matell did not give her those feelings. Instead she apologises for not giving him more attention?Anyways, it wasn't feminist enough for me. It felt like it avoided some major issues of real life (like the phrase \"we just learned how to hide it better\" that did not get addressed whatsoever). Like, the Barbies now know that women don't have it as great as them in the real world? How does that solve anything?Maybe i am just reading too deep into a movie with flawed worldbuilding, made for people who don't generally see the gender bias around them?4 for some funny jokes, but it could be funnier.\n",

I was never a Barbie girl and was often in trouble as a child for abusing my sister's and cousins' dolls but this movie! Very funny (and touching) and SO beautiful. The cast is perfect, the set designs are phenomenal and, from start to finish, everything is very well thought out. I took a star off because I thought the dream ballet was a bit much but even that made sense after I listened to the extras on the disc and heard the director tell why she included the sequence. The movie is not a children's movie and now I understand why so many adults have gone to see it.\n",

      "Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better \"villain\" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a \"masterpiece\".\n",

      "Yes Barbie is the title of the movie but when watching it I increasingly feel like she is only playing the supporting role to Ken in a weird way.Ken is kinda a simp but he's also the only one that has a proper story around him, starting as a nobody, then his whole personality changed when he got his \"redpilled\" moment, got some musical songs to perform, have a comradery moment with the other Ken's before it finally went back to normal. It all made him a lot more human than Barbie ever was in the film.The weirdest thing in this movie though, is that despite singing girl power and feminism, it doesn't have likeable female characters outside of their good looks. Most of the females in this film are bland, mean, manipulative, and somewhat narcissitic especially when the word perfect always getting brought up. They don't even put in any scenes about the hardship of women, outside of maybe the booty grabbing part which is done like a joke. I wished they would've shown more of that instead of putting that in a speech. And you get a female lead that doesn't even want change or do anything with it unless being pushed around. There is no process around any of the achievements or struggles on the women's side, just results in a form of speeches and short scenes.\n",

Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally.\n",

Second issue is about the Creator (ghost of Ruth Handler). Barbie meets her in the kitchen I felt like she Barb is a Neo from Matrix...too many similarities. Finally the Geppetto (Ruth) will grand Barbie's wish. No and no! Barbie in the movie is a narcisst who ruled cause she was aromantic. She is like a child in an adult body. Sugar daddys are looking for that kind of persons. Matriarchy without a c..t not a hard job apparently. They show how to use men for women advantages only. Finally thx to \"Geppetto\" she the Barbie got a c..t for herself so she moved out from Barbieland. It is really all wrong. Barbie is not supposed to be Paris Hilton biography. Barbie is a doll and not deserve a movie. Barbie is a mannequin and a business. You can not make a good movie about a Barbie when you use a Pinocchio idea. Barbie aspired to be a real woman.

The writing was very well thought out and barely gives you a second to catch your breath. Now the star of the show Margot Robbie. I could have wrote a whole review just on her performance. Although we all know her as a very talented actress, she was definitely built for this role.

      "Barbie struggles to both identify and captivate the audience. Who is it written for? Whist there is one laugh out loud moments; with Sugar Daddy Barbie, the movie seems too drawn out and drags at times. Despite having important themes about misogyny, you can't help feel that a bit more subtlety would have got the message across. Whilst empowering the female characters and making them well rounded, the male characters come across as macho stereotypes. I was looking forward to seeing future Doctor Who Ncuti Gatwa, but it was more of a blink and you will miss it. Rather than a message of equality, you are left feeling this has a women are superior message.On a positive note, though, the movie is a great homage to the history of Barbie and it is very much about spotting the discontinued Barbie products. It also shows young girls that they can be ambitious and anything is possible.\n",

There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.\n",

It really argues about feelings and social deconstruction, and in the work doesn't show a treat any of the genders superior to others, in reality there is a dependency between genders that is easily evidenced, talks about the importance of knowing how to value oneself as a person and it is evidenced in the relationship between Barbie (Margot) and Ken (Ryan), in which Ken has a dependency on Barbie in which he cannot exist without her, which is reflected in our society.\n",

She drinks out of empty cups, showers under a waterless shower, can fly around as if transported by a hand just a like a real doll house. At some point, Barbie starts becoming a real woman by thinking about death, having cellulite and her feet flatten out. She goes into the real world to find the girl that broke the spacetime continuum and started to make her real.All this time, we see lots of Barbies (all of them named Barbie) that have advanced degrees, are racially diverse, with different body types even. The Kens are brainless bodybuilders who don't have any occupation other than being pretty and overly infatuated with the Barbies. Ryan Gosling does an excellent job and portrays Ken perfectly which was surprising to me. Definitely an Oscar performance for the actor. Also Margot Robbie is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking across the whole movie, a true real life Barbie doll who also plays the part perfectly. We also have basically half the cast of Sex Education and lots of references to other movies like: the Matrix, Pinocchio and maybe others which i haven't observed.This being said, the problems start to pile up now cause all of the above is just a superficial sugar coating for the real reason of the movie: gender theory propaganda. The world is reduced to the patriarchy. When Barbie and Ken go to the real world, Barbie feels objectified and powerless and Ken starts understanding the patriarchy. While the real world is a true patriarchy the Barbie world is a true matriarchy. Long story short, Ken goes back to the Barbie world, establishes the patriarchy there and then Barbie and \"her owner\" go back to the Barbie world and reestablish the matriarchy. The movie is blunt and frankly disappointing in its portrayal of men and women. Men are nothing. Women are everything. Men, portrayed through Ken, don't have meaning, and are not supposed to have meaning in life, they just exist to be \"beach\"-ing and simp over Barbies. Women on the other hand are everything: lawyers, teachers, senators, presidents, PhDs, scientists etc.I dare the audience to think of the Barbie movie in reverse, women are nothing and men are everything. That would be an outrageous movies and the directors would be down right cancelled.The movie does not present the true condition of being a woman today, but it just hates on men and wants them crushed and powerless in a sort of historical revenge. It reduced the world and the complex social dynamics between men and women to patriarchy. The movie it's divisive, destructive and does not solve any problems. I honestly felt like i was in an Orwell novel. It's a pitty, because the set was very good and had a lot of potential for something deep and meaningful, something that could have brought men and women together as a team. But instead it resorted to SJW, woke, extreme left ideology and apparently the audience was brainlessly having it.\n",

      "I loved this movie. The acting was phenomenal, story line and dialogue were great, the sets and costumes were just *chefs kiss*. I took my mom, who is 70, and loved watching her turn into a little girl again. She kept saying \"I remember that Barbie!\" regarding Midge and Allen. I can see why guys don't enjoy it as much, but the point is, this movie is for women, by women, and very much enjoyed by women. The message is for all though, and I'm sad some people don't get it. Little girls can go and be enthralled with all the colors. There's nothing too overt for them to see. Mostly the movie will go over their heads.\n",

      "I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through.\n",

      "I went in to this movie expecting a huge joke of a movie and came out with a smile on my face and a warm heart. So many things resonated with me, from the weird Barbie that I inherited from my older sister, to never really understanding where Ken lived or why he never went to work. Margot Robbie was the perfect Barbie. America Ferrera did a brilliant job of being a normal woman trying to explain how to be the 'perfect' woman to Barbie. Ryan Gosling STOLE THE MOVIE! His Ken was so insanely good and the 'I am just Ken' song and dance routine was insanely good! Thank you Greta Gerwig for writing this movie!\n",

      "This movie moved me deeply. I am a 20-year-old girl and to finally see a movie that deals with gender inequality and patriarchy in such an intelligent way was something I really did not expect. Very satisfied. Hearing and seeing an acknowledgement of our current situation as a society was absolutely necessary. During several scenes of the film I literally had tears in my eyes because I finally felt understood. The message in my opinion is clearly expressed. It is up to the viewer to perceive it. Anyone who thinks that the ending expresses the superiority of barbies over ken is missing the point, they are completely off the mark. Not only women's issues are shown in the movie, but also men's issues. I highly recommend viewing also for men, without prejudice and with the will to understand. Nothing more to add, a masterpiece that deals with very topical social issues that we needed. Thank you Barbie.\n",

      "I am neither a Barbie lover nor hater but I am a fan of great sets and creative films so I was prepared to put up with a bad story line to see the visuals but I LOVED it! So, so funny, Ryan Gosling was amazing as was everyone really. Haven't laughed so consistently in a film for ages. The end was slightly weaker so I've knocked off a point but regardless it's one of the best films I've seen in ages. The sets were amazing as I had hoped. I could have lived without the Will Ferrel character as it felt a little bit spoofy whenever he was on screen, a bit overacted but that's just a minor criticism in a brilliant movie. Well done team!\n",

The message in this movie made me ball out crying and i still am. It taught me that i don't have to be perfect, or pretty, or always having everything under control. I can be a little bit clumsy at times, or i can cry, or have a bad hair day. It doesn't matter. As long as i'm happy and comfortable in my own skin it's fine. Barbie isn't just barbie. No, she's barbara millicent roberts, she's barbara hangler. She's a pilot, a dancer, a doctor, a teacher, the president. She's anything she wants to be and so can you.\n",

The use of practical effects was such a compelling part of how the set designs really came alive in the film in a way that made you feel immersed in it.Though I didn't really feel like Simu Liu's performance added much to the character he portrays (mid ken, ngl), Ryan Gosling and Margo Robbie absolutely killed it in their respective roles. Peak casting.Overall? Thoroughly enjoyed how this film fitted together and it made for an extremely original film.\n",

      "I tried getting tickets for this movie for 3 days, and it was all sold out. But we didn't give up. The sun rose, and determination made me do the longest line at 2pm for a showtime at 9pm. Watching a movie in a third world country while on vacation is hard.Back to the main point, I cried. Don't watch this movie with your mom, because you will sob and try your hardest not to make a sound in a silent room.This movie captures girlhood in such a unique way, not a lot of people will get it. Barbie was my childhood-so when I sat down in the movie theater, it wasn't eighteen year old me that watched it, but little 4-13 year old me. It was such a beautiful experience; dressing up and being a girl. It made me really happy and I fully enjoyed it.\n",

      "I struggle to comprehend the hype surrounding this movie. Apart from the political commentary and feminist themes it presents, I find it difficult to see the appeal. While the film boasts a cast of well-known actors and Margot Robbie's performance is commendable, the overall plot seems lacking in direction. Additionally, the quality of the special effects and CGI left much to be desired. The ending, in particular, struck me as one of the most nonsensical conclusions I've encountered. There is one positive aspect I can acknowledge - the movie successfully revitalized the brand and its color scheme for a female audience. This achievement can be attributed to the effective marketing strategy that propelled its success. If you would like, I can help you further develop and refine your thoughts on the movie.\n",

I wish the underlying meaning to the story was a little more subtle, but it was good nonetheless.The soundtrack/songs were one of my favorite things about the film, and they fit really well into scenes. As someone who doesn't enjoy musical numbers in a movie that much, I like these a lot, because they were actually good songs.One of the final scenes of the movie, where Barbie and Ruth were standing together talking about being human was so pretty and well done. It actually got me a little emotional, which I didn't expect.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling really did their jobs well, along with others like Micheal Cera.

      "We can be surprised at the bold feminist narrative of this film, which turned out to be a larger portion of the movie that most anticipated, but we should all learn from it. How urgent is an appreciation for women and their leadership if it takes a movie about literal toys in a fantasyland to see a female president? Barbie shows us what society would look like if women occupied ALL of the roles currently held by men, which quickly illustrates the alarming lack of representation. Barbie points out the irony in laughing an all-female Supreme Court, when the United States Supreme Court (for example) was all-male for its first 191 years. Barbie's achievements extend to business leadership, Nobel Prizes, and space travel.The film breaks down feminism for all ages and gender identities, taking female empowerment to levels so basic that young children will immediately recognizes real inequalities in our world. Gerwig and the wonderful cast explore feminism through mother-daughter relationships, the workplace, and even generational differences through a touching portrayal of Barbie's founder, Ruth Handler.A host of LGBTQ+ characters add to the strong community atmosphere of this film, in addition to physically disabled characters and other marginalized Barbies who effectively teach inclusion as a benchmark and not an ideal. The film wastes no time pandering to those who take issue with the narrative and by doing so, encourages women to unapologetically take up space.Mattel's willingness to confront the unrealistic body expectations and problematic pieces of Barbie's history head-on seriously validates the message of this film and the importance of doing better because you know better. Cheers for Barbie!\n",

No one laughed at the supposedly funny scenes. It was a dread. Dude people go to a Barbie movie to have fun, we have social media to preach about political issues everyday.

Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.When the movie first started I really didn't know what it was going to be, I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists, and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays, but this quickly proved otherwise. It had the perfect amount of jokes, (which were surprisingly funny) the plot was simple but entertaining . Toward the end of the movie it got really serious, and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person.

      "About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.I told my human it was pretty much Rocky Horror Picture Show without the sexuality and way more pink. Not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time. If it wasn't so new then i would do an Episode on my podcast about it.\n",

      "Barbie movie had superb casting, writing, acting, and plot twists. It was a surprisingly cerebral movie with a poignant message on the perils of patriarchy in the real world and the exclusion of men in the Barbie land. At its heart, Barbie is a movie about self-discovery. The movie is much more insightful than I expected and takes a deep dive into the perils of minimizing the humanity of women and men be it in Barbie Land or the real world.Barbie Movie has some plot twists and it challenges stereotypes and preconceived notions of the roles of men and women in society. Barbie doesn't want to be put in a box in the real world and Ken wants to have value and a meaningfully existence in Barbie Land.\n",

Unfortunately, even well-chosen actors, well-written songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenario.A mess of banal clichés and a completely wasted opportunity. With such a budget, a cast and an interesting iconic toy, it should have been handled better.The film has a very interesting and brisk first half, but from the second it drags on at a disgusting pace.Even worse is the completely inappropriate, overblown and absurd push towards feminism.\n",

      "Barbie (2023):Barbie (2023) is a clever political comedy, instilled with scenes of artfully-employed and often-touching drama, and rife with thinly, albeit comedically veiled commentaries on the woes and whims of patriarchal society, neo-feminism, republicanism, and, surprisingly given the film's main overarching themes, democrat beliefs. At a runtime of 1h 54m, the film was fantastic; I thoroughly enjoyed my viewing, particularly due to the performances of one of the strongest casts I've seen in any film released this year, with Robbie (as Barbie), Gosling (as 'beach' Ken), Ferrel (my favourite performance of the movie, as the Mattel CEO), Mckinnon (as 'weird' Barbie), and Cera (as Alan), amongst others, serving the film's witty, multi-faceted writing well. Each person felt perfect for their role, and I don't personally think it could have been cast any better. It was perfect.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.The story is simple, but well executed and easily palatable for a range of ages, largely in thanks to the near-scintillating writing of Gerwig and Baumbach, and the clever concealment of political messages, such that they either: fit in well with the story and serve pivotally to the plot (Ken introducing the patriarchy to the other Kens in Barbie Land, or, as it becomes, Kendom), or, are placed into a scene in which they cause no hindrance or clunkiness and simply convey a message (Ferrel's character, much like his President Business in the Lego Movie, wears an outfit analogous to that of Donald Trump, and Ken's whole newly-instated patriarchy is certainly designed to mimic many republican beliefs, along with perpetuating stereotypes like gorging on beers by day and engaging in superficial traditionalisms (horses!)). The comedy is, by all accounts, really funny. Multiple gags persist throughout, like the discontinuation of 'Pregnant Barbie', the lack of genitalia on Barbies and Kens, Weird Barbie (Mckinnon), and the callowness of the Mattel executives. There are great one-off jokes too, and many are clearly intended to cater towards adults, as well as children, like when Barbie sees a billboard for the 'Miss Universe' beauty pageant on the Venice Boardwalk, coming to the conclusion that they must be the Supreme Court (most political entities are conventionally attractive females in Barbie Land), 'depressed Barbie', along with other Barbies playing off body-image stereotypes, and a surprising innuendo spoken by Ferrel's character, in which, with no real context, he refers to the Mattel HQ as a 'long, phallic building'. Overall, the film is very funny, and knows when to, and when not to employ comedy in a scene for the best effect.The pacing is tight for the first half, and it manages to maintain good overall pace throughout, slowing slightly towards the end but still moving along nicely up until the credits roll.Now, the characters. I can't lie, there is not a lot to say, and that's not a bad thing. Each performance is marvellous, thanks largely in part to great casting, but for me, the characters didn't evolve all that much over the film's runtime. Sure, Barbie ends up a human (and gains genitalia somehow, implied by the final scene(?)), Ken becomes slightly more self-aware I guess, the Mattel execs just sort-of sway freely between Barbie-perpetuated matriarchy-proponents, and self-absorbed, blatant sexists, and Weird Barbie becomes de-ostracized, but apart from that, the rest serve as vessels for the film's message, simple and entertaining, but devoid of complexity. One character, Alan (played by Cera), did catch my attention, though I'll talk about him more in my criticisms down below. Another great thing I noticed was the movie's drama. I was actually surprised prior to watching, when I read, via Google, that its genres were Comedy/Drama, and upon watching, was pleasantly surprised. The film includes a few rather touching scenes, satisfying enough not to dull the tone, but serious enough to have impact on the viewer, and aren't plagued by cringy music, nor excessive jokes. They are raw, by all accounts. One such scene features Barbie sat on a public bench, shortly after realising that the world is not a matriarchal 'haven' like Barbie Land. As she cries (in a cowgirl-outfit, no-less), she notices an older woman sat across from her, and tearily declares her 'beautiful', playing on the film's themes of existence, ageing, and impending mortality. It serves as the heart of the movie, and was on-par with something one may expect to find in a more serious drama. Another includes Barbie's meeting with Ruth Handler's ghost(?) in the Mattel head-office, which is later complimented by another, which is laden with innocuous jokes about Ruth's tax-evasion scandals, and holds a more comedic tone.Now, earlier, I praised the film's use of veiled political undertones, but I also believe there were some that didn't quite work. Firstly, I am not sure what message the film was actually pedalling. It certainly wasn't feminism, as many seem to think. Sure, many scenes involve strong women, demonized men (we don't all catcall, sexually harass, or otherwise dominate women in our daily lives), and a somewhat functional matriarchy (only functional for the women), but the film also seems pretty critical of neo-feminist beliefs and ideals. It quite blatantly criticises the matriarchy, in that all of the men are oppressed and exist only to fawn over the women who don't want them, and shows that nonconventional Barbies (Weird Barbie) are ostracized and bullied for deformities which they can't help. Though, it also criticises the patriarchy, in that, nearly every man in the movie sexually objectifies women (to the degree of fetishising them by putting them in skimpy maid outfits), the women that support the patriarchy are all 'brainwashed', and must be 'reprogrammed' in order to have them rebel, and that the patriarchs are all somewhat stupid, or callow. What was the aim?Elsewise, the republicans are certainly minced throughout. Donald Trump symbology, criticism of traditionalist ideals, and the emphasis on cast-diversity certainly sees to this (the cast has multiple black people, latin-americans, and a lesbian, in Kate Mckinnon, amongst other represented minorities). Though, the character I mentioned earlier, Alan, seems to criticise those who are democrats (Left-wing works), in that he is ostracized by the Kens, largely ignored by the Barbies, and seeks to escape, stating that no-one will care if an Alan gets into the real world. He is one of those 'no other character likes them' characters, and overall, manages to throw the film's message into disarray. There is no steadfast, discernable message as far as I can see, and all agendae are both furthered and criticised, with none that stick. As in the end, Barbie Land is still ruled matriarchally, and the Kens are still held in lower esteem by the Barbies, though, the real world is unchanged, and Mattel shows no signs of incorporating female leadership. Furthermore, the Kens never seem to gain any purpose, which was their whole goal. As far as I can tell, they get no dreamhouses, no equality, no horses, no jobs, and no love (</3). This didn't ruin the film for me, by any means, and I still herald it as the best one I've watched this year so far (I am to watch Oppenheimer soon), but it does make me wonder what Gerwig and Baumbach really had in mind.Overall, the film was great, and I would recommend it for all, as long as they can take a joke, don't hate women, don't hate men, and aren't perturbed by politics. It is witty, fun, touching, and hilarious, sated with fantastic performances and easily palatable characters. I give this film an 8/10, and will definitely watch it again.\n",

Also, I can relate to finding my identity in a girl, and I really liked that Barbie and Ken had a conversation about finding yourself. \"Maybe it's Ken, and it's Barbie.\" I LOOOOVE that.

I was happy in the beginning but then they changed what I thought the movie was about .The movie was too long, the girls were mean and superficial, and when I thought Barbie have learned how to treat a man, she just strikes back with selfishness.

      "I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon.\n",

I didn't know what to expect and started out thinking when we were in Barbie Land how are they going to make this interesting for the next hour and 1/2. I found out and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns I didn't expect. When Barbie ends up in the 'real world' it goes from entertaining to interesting and unexpected. Margo is perfect as Barbie, Ryan as Ken is over the top and to be enjoyed. What I haven't read and am a little disappointed by is the failure to recognize how good America Ferrerra and Ariana Greenblatt were. Totally enjoyed their screen time as well. Don't event get me started on Kate McKinnon as 'weird' Barbie.

      "The Barbie movie interested me at first. I wasn't expecting anything more than a silly movie with an interesting message, maybe it could've been a great way to show people the struggles of women in modern society, however this movie really disappoints.Honestly, I was enjoying this picture very much around the first act, some jokes were landing, it was silly but it seemed to have no wish of making a statement. Barbieland seemed very far from reality, and that's what made it funny. Ken getting flown by the waves in the most unnatural way, just because he wants to prove himself, also his \"job\" is beach, I found that very funny.However, I was expecting the real world to be a turning point in the movie, if the real world actually seemed tonally different from Barbieland or even seem real in any way, characters like Will ferrell's CEO of Mattel and the employees just make the real world feel as silly and dumb as Barbieland, though Will Ferrell is hilarious in this movie.However I would let that one slide if it wasn't for other characters that feel dumb and just dumb, not funny. Like Sasha, who is a completely useless character that was introduced as this mean, depressed teenager that wants to harm everyone for no reason, however, she never again is presented this way. Somehow she is a nice girl later in the movie and even defends her mom in the rare instances of her actually saying something in the second to third act of the movie. Her mom, though, has a more important role, however she is one of the big elements that ruin this movie, her speech near the end of the second act feels like she's stating the obvious and not really making a difference, however, for some reason, everyone buys it, and Barbie no longer has depression. It looks like Greta has no clue how to express depression on screen.Barbie tries to create emotional moments in a couple of scenes and in the very ending, which feel totally out of tone as I feel like Margot's character really doesn't have much depth and these scenes are dropped in the worst times, and are not impactful. It looks like Greta has no clue how to express depression on screen, as some moments that could've been sad are treated as jokes.When Ken figures out about patriarchy and goes back to Barbieland is where this movie shows what its true message is. The Kens end up ruling Barbieland and all the Barbies get mind-controlled, except for Margot. But then the day is saved as all the Barbies take control of Barbieland once again and the Kens remain with no power whatsoever. I see this as Greta's moment of telling the audience that this movie is not for men, or she just truly believes men should shut up and let women do what they will, as equality truly is never a goal in this movie.As the narrator says \"one day the Kens will have the same rights as women in the real world\", I noticed the hatred coming along. If Barbieland symbolizes something, it would be an utopia, the perfect society. However, instead of solving the problem of this \"utopia\" by giving power to Kens and creating a true perfect balance, it comes back to status-quo by keeping Kens powerless, showing Greta's real wish here. I feel it's a huge mistake as the movie brings up the topic of change halfway through while not making a good example, contradicting its own morals, if they were correct in the first place.Barbie's character arc is not bad but it's poorly executed, it seems like it's all over the place and the writers didn't know how to develop her. Sometimes she is annoying, oftentimes she is dumb, but mostly her arc is based on her depression and how she feels. Though we don't really feel like her, and I get confused on how the depressed doll thing works, I'm really confused as no other depressed person ever played with a doll before, it seems like children are seen as dull and have no emotions that matter, because if the dolls reflect their personality, then they would be dumb and never question reality as the Barbies and Kens do. But Barbie is the only one that does, and this is why she turns into a human in the end, it's not a very emotional ending, it feels overly dramatic as the topics being covered and the tone of the movie doesn't build up to this moment. But Barbie now living in the real world is fine, it just isn't anything special.Overall this movie instigates hatred and is doing this at this very moment in real life, the polarizing nature of this movie is clear here. It's lack of self-doubt and the need of proving itself correctly while not being right whatsoever makes us, who didn't enjoy the movie, turn into the villains, as our opinion becomes irrelevant and can be refuted with simply: \"I bet your favorite movie is The Godfather\". I'm not trying to pick any side as I'm just giving my opinion. I respect all opinions and expect people to do the same.This movie could be fine in its own right if it wasn't for the toxic and sheer irrational nature that it generates, which is a reflection of our society and the hatred we keep inside and, often, only let it out in movies such as this one. Though I'm looking forward to more new ideas like this one, as the industry is starting to come back with inventive and creative pictures that bring people to the cinema and generate revenue, just hoping to be better movies next time. Barbie(2023) 3/10.\n",

      "Barbie was so fun! I think some scenes were a bit hard to follow but I think that's a fun play on how girls play with dolls. I laughed a lot and felt a bit moved and touched. I wasn't really sure what to expect but it was fun to watch all the way through! I loved all of the vintage Barbie pieces and references to the many versions of the doll as well. The scenery was amazing, I think Barbie land gave off a technicolor vibe which was amazing. The scene I loved the most was when Barbie comments on how beautiful the old lady was and the older woman says she knows it! It's a fun film for women of all ages, my grandmother, mother, sisters and friends could all relate to this film! A true masterpiece on girlhood and womanhood.\n",

      "Had high hopes for this one but man it just wasn't funny to me at all and I love to laugh. I suppose maybe this was too smart a humor for me seeing that I'm a woman in her fifties with middle school boy humor (think The Hangover, Million Ways to Die in the West). Maybe Barbie's message-based 'humor' went over my head but man I couldn't wait for this one to be over. And that speech the mom made toward the end that everyone is singing the praises of? It was pure cringe. More power to those who found this movie to be cinema gold but I'll stick with Seth McFarland for my humor, thank you very much.\n",

      "I love that this movie is as others put it \"preachy\". I feel that with the current climate and so many young ladies losing freedoms and not realizing how far women have come in the past 60 years we need reminding how quickly it can all go away, lest young ladies today get too comfortable.There is a lot in this movie about mother/daughter relationships, women's roles in society and how hard it is to be a woman in a society that expects perfection. It is also fun, some great jokes, and Rhea Pearlman really made such a wonderful appearance. When Barbie first came out, it was a time when women didn't have as many options as they do now, women couldn't even have credit! I feel like this movie is a nod to what Barbie is supposed to stand for but also for the ways Barbie has fallen short.\n",

      "This thought-provoking movie is definitely not geared towards children or exclusively for girls; it's a must-watch for audiences of all backgrounds. It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.\n",

      "I never would have gone to see this movie if it weren't for a friend showing up to a party and telling me that it was a masterpiece. She described it as high art, which to me is high praise. After seeing it, I agree. It has all of the qualities of high art in that it is bound to be confusing to some, interpreted differently, and will inspire great feelings positive and negative depending on the viewer.Barbie gives you every opportunity to come in thinking you will be getting the silly quirky female equivalent of the Marvel universe. Vapid problems, absurdity, boys, and a classical formulaic movie arc. And it some ways it does keep to that.But all of those things are overshadowed by the philosophical discussion taking place. The director shows two worlds in juxtaposition: The Barbie Universe and the real world in present day. Matriarchy and Patriarchy.By removing a sense of consequence from the lives and decisions of the characters from the Barbie universe, it instead is able to engage on the philosophical level. A good comparison is 'The Good Place.' Characters don't have to act or respond realistically, instead characters respond thoughtfully and in accordance with the philosophical archetypes they represent.The Barbie universe is made to be perfect for the women that run that society, the Kens are riddled with need for validation. They hold no power of their own and Barbies have no incentive to share it.Through some plot vehicles, Barbie and Ken come to the real world. In one of the most important scenes of the film, Barbie and Ken walk down Venice Beach arriving from their strange plastic universe. For the first time the ultimately empowered Barbie is ogled and cat-called and made to feel unsafe, and the ultimately disempowered Ken is made to feel respected just for being alive.I think this specific scene is really important because it's at the center of understanding the context for modern feminism. The simple difference between navigating walking down the street as a woman vs a man. Our world feels qualitatively different depending on who we are. Our feelings of safety and security in the public can differ wildly depending on what body we inhabit.Cheekily, the film is made for the female gaze. All men in the film are shown as being vapid and thoughtless both in the Barbie universe and the real world. I feel that this was an intentional decision to cause feelings of discomfort in men that watch. It serves to both flip the standard movie script (that has been improving in recent years) where it has been normal for female characters to be accessories to a plot and eye-candy for the male viewer and not ends in themselves, and also to make similarities between male viewers and Ken sting a bit. As a male viewer and musician I felt a painful twinge when Ken says \"let me play music at you\" It caused me to wonder how much space I take up socially with my music, and aware of how playing music when it's not expressly desired can have a way of shutting down vulnerable conversation. Similarly the depictions of male to male empowerment felt familiar caricatures with a grain of truth to them.As the conflict ends and Barbie world returns to Matriarchy the film ends on a thoughtful tone. In both worlds the subjugated sex needs to fight for power being ungenerously allotted to them by the ruling sex. With a clear message that nobody wants either of these worlds, that in discarding the feelings of the unempowered denizens of our world we create a weak foundation, that true acceptance and understanding of these issues comes from letting in our full mortal nature and the realities that come with being human. That being messy, complex, and sexual beings is what gives meaning to this world and what is called for in any conversation on equality and class disparity.Despite our expectations, Barbie, isn't dumb. It reflects a lot of thought and understanding of the current moment. It uses archetypes and simple forms to discuss real issues in the zeitgeist today. It discusses the problems with Barbie as a brand, with some formulations of feminism, with patriarchical society and what is does to women's understandings of themselves.Barbie represents an awareness that far surpasses anybody's expectations of the intellectual property it represents, and is worth the uncomfortable and somewhat depressing nature of the film for the dialog it opens up.\n",

      "The camp in the movie was creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 10/10. Having a character yell at you for two minutes about how hard being a woman is isn't creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 1/10.But I still did love the movie. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. The sets, the costumes, the small jokes were all so wonderful. The Barbie world feels totally separate and complete. Ryan Gosling was really the star of the movie for me. Every moment he was on screen I loved it. The moments I didn't love, were really hard to get through. I loved the take of Barbieland being a total matriarchy, but I really didn't need to be beaten over the head with a stick for two minutes to get the point they were trying to make.\n",

      "The discussion surrounding the Barbie movie has generated varying viewpoints, with some reviewers suggesting that the film is critical of men, portraying them as weak and insecure. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the movie offers a sophisticated commentary on broader societal dynamics, encompassing power dynamics, oppression, and gender roles.To begin with, the movie underscores that patriarchy, as a structural framework, doesn't uniformly favour all men. This is exemplified by Ken, whose lack of opportunities becomes apparent in the context of the real world. Contrary to the idea that patriarchy inherently benefits all men, the film sheds light on how this system works to elevates those who already have wealth and authority within society. In essence, it unveils that a genuine world where patriarchy benefits all men, albeit an unlikely scenario, could only exist in a world where conventional rules and responsibilities don't exist (Barbieland), while simultaneously presenting us with an already failing matriarchy that oppresses men.A key theme that emerges is the portrayal of oppression as a learned behaviour. Ken's exploration into patriarchy serves as a catalyst for his evolution. The display of toxic masculinity he develops is rooted in the adoption of traits he observes in an attempt to gain respect and power. It becomes clear, however, that this façade doesn't genuinely resonate with him as a person. In the final moments of the movie, Ken rejects the ideas and behaviours he initially believed to be powerful, realising that they neither align with who he is as a person or make him feel fulfilled. This underscores how societal expectations often make men feel pressured into conforming to behaviours within a system that, in reality, fails to serve their genuine interests.There is a clear narrative in the last 20 minutes of the movie to show that most men, while being aware of patriarchy, aren't actively trying to oppress women, which is really clear when Ken says he thought it was just about riding horses. This highlights how many men, while aware of patriarchy, don't actively try to oppress women. Instead, sticking to the status quo comes from a fear of challenging the existing power structures out of fear of losing power or falling into the same state of oppression they were forcing on women.Ultimately, the core message of the movie is to advocate for an equitable world that doesn't support the dominance of men or women. The film suggests that power does not need be gained through oppression. Instead, it shows that the best solution lies in an world where everyone has equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations. This is symbolised by Ken's transformation into an authentic version of himself, shedding the confines of the \"Beach Ken\" stereotype. Similarly, \"Stereotypical Barbie\" is portrayed as lacking resonance with genuine womanhood. In essence, the film advocates for a world where individuality flourishes, irrespective of gender, and where empowerment is rooted in authenticity rather than conforming to the roles society puts on us.To summarise, the Barbie movie is more than it's surface interpretations and works to show an exploration of power dynamics, oppression, and societal roles. Its portrayal of characters and their transformations serves as a mirror to the complexity of real-world issues, ultimately advocating for a society where real empowerment stems from embracing individuality and fostering equal opportunities for all.To people who think the Barbie movie casts a negative light on men and depicts them as weak, it's important to recognise that the film's intention is not to generalise or demean masculinity, just as much as it works to dismantle toxic elements of femininity. While certain aspects of the movie might seem critical of traditional gender roles, its deeper message speaks the complexities of power dynamics and societal expectations that affect everyone. The movie's portrayal of characters like Ken undergoing transformation and introspection is not about condemning masculinity, but rather an exploration of the pressures society places on individuals to conform to predefined roles. By engaging with the film in this broader context, it becomes evident that it aims to foster understanding and empathy, rather than to vilify masculinity as a whole.\n",

      "First, let me say there are some laughs in this movie and I enjoyed some of the comedy. Absolutely fun for kids and family (minus the sexual innuendos and sexual jokes). Honestly I believe this movie is making money cus of the brand alone. Visually this movie is appealing. Yes. Absolutely. Straight out of the toy stores and out of the Barbie toy boxes. Story wise this movie is a dump. Mediocre at best. Feminist heavy which is fine, but the story itself is what makes it a dump. It makes no sense. If you're expecting a Lego movie or Free Guy type of reveal, there is not one. The humans literally just cross over to \"Barbieland\" and Barbie herself is able to stay in the \"human\" world which is apparently a skip and a jump away from the city. This makes the movie seem like it's Disney channel material and not really Disney theater material. It's a Barbie movie so I wasn't expecting much but to not explain why and how everyone is able to just crossover to \"Barbieland\" is bad writing. The main character draws a sad Barbie and it makes Barbie in the nearby very real \"Barbieland\" sad. Barbie can somehow feel her emotions. So with no explanation why, Barbie is supposed to be a doll but is also real and has a connection to this woman who's works for Mattel and draws Barbie in her free time. Mattel CEO's can also crossover to \"Barbieland\" and it's normal. This side of the story is terrible. Aside from the obvious feminist storyline there is no other story that makes sense. It's all just Disney channel silliness. The final scene serves no purpose other than to serve for another inside sexual joke. So dumb.The Oscar talk surrounding this movie is absurd. As a real movie, it's a terrible movie. While Gosling is funny here, should he be nominated for playing a silly, sad Ken doll? Literally anyone could have played these roles. There was nothing Oscar worthy in these performances. Gosling has turned in some great performances in his career but this is just not one of them. Nominating him would be equivalent to nominating Kurt Russell for his role in Sky High. Nothing outstanding.Of course women and little girls will find this movie entertaining. Thanks to nostalgia and the visually appealing sets it will connect with most females. Is it really Oscar worthy? I'd say no. There is no real acting done in this movie. Nominating this movie for anything other than visual, costumes and/or sets, would be an insult to the actors that have truly acted in some amazing roles.Should you watch this movie? Sure. Why not. Like I said it's visually appealing and is funny, and is feminist heavy. Most women should and will most likely enjoy this movie. Anyone with a sense of story telling, might not. I would suggest watching Free Guy, and the Lego movie. Much better stories being told there that actually do make sense.\n",

      "This movie was not made for younger kids who would understand it's deep meaning and I feel as if that was a heavy marketing flaw. However, I am not someone who judges a movie based on marketing around it, just the product. I can confidently say that this movie is messy, but it's a kind of messy I really enjoyed and would recommend to someone if they are trying to find a humorous, light hearted movie that has a strong message.This movie is flawed but I still find it within myself to give it a ten because I have not enjoyed a movie this much in quite some time. The showing of the harm and sexualization of women in the real world can be considered inappropriate to some parents or families, so if you don't want your young kid seeing that (even if brief) proceed with a slight caution, however it is a short scene and can most likely be missed.\n",

It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.The only downside is that you have to close those doors, and that leads to a more cliche/expected wrap up of the story that takes away some of the uniqueness brought by the movie.Overall, a very recommended watch and a guilty pleasure for years to come!\n",

The storyline was dry and over-political.I'd have liked to see more LGBTQ+ representation and breaking stereotypes, as it felt like just a generic film. Even the Barbies were considered stereotypes!Comedy throughout was limited and wasn't engaging at all - sometimes trying too hard to emphasise feminism and going too far in the opposite direction to the world is heading in (I'm not encouraging patriarchy).However, I did find the music quite good (especially the Billie Eilish song) and did redeem the movie a little bit.In summary, the movie was mediocre at best and there's not much to discuss.

I do not regret using 1 hour and 54 minutes of my life on this movieSpoileralertThe filmmakers are luring us in with great actors and comedy. And then we get the real message hidden behind all that. Barbies world is gender opposite from the real world. Here are all barbies winners, leaders and the important. They are main characters in life and in the movie. In the real world it's mostly men instead. The Ken's (men) are presented as stupid, sexy, and not so important characters. Just they way women mostly are presented as in the most movies. As in the real world. When women realize how the difference in gender views affect their life. They take action. The Ken's does that in movie too. The Ken's went overboard and did not hesitate to downgrade the barbies to sexy women who only can grab a beer for them and even took their homes, positions and jobs. The barbie movie are really about genders, and showing us a world where the gender roles and vision are completely switched. The Ken's are the women of real world.I think barbie is an legendary movie who really shows how many women experience the world. And as every comedy it is a hidden message there. But in barbie it is much stronger. So for some people who don't enjoy lessons. The movie is might not for you. But for thoose who are open minded and enjoy something new. This is the movie for you.The only thing I did not enjoy about the movie is that the leaders in the board of barbie organization was made way too stupid. It would actually be better if they were in normal intelligence state.

It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10/10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist.

      "Had so much more potential. This script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel. Although Margot Robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well, it's not enough to carry this movie alone. Ryan Gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment, especially during the first half of the film. Not the worst movie of the year but not the best of it's release week either.Overall feeling is Gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point. I am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs. Ultimately they tried to be a little too deep, muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way.\n",

      "In this movie, I cried, laughed, had deep thoughts... I consider myself a big fan of the soundtrack, and i absolutely loved the story, characters, topic etc. I found the touch to feminism extremely reflecting our society, and I recommend this movie for anyone who- anyone, just anyone. This is a movie that will change people's minds and educate children while being a fun movie with an interesting plot! I definitely want to watch it again, since time flew by so quickly while watching this masterpiece, this amazing film that really made me leave the hall in tears.

      "Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.\n",

I liked the way that they the movie had sad partes but that were funny and I liked the way that even when things were serious, they put them in an hilarious way.I enjoyed the end, because it ended up well to Ken and to Barbie, and everyone got happy.I hope that Ken finds his person and I would really like a continuation of this movie.\n",

      "While there were definitely some funny parts, they were too few to outweigh the other annoyingly cheesy jokes thrown around. The actors seemed a bit on the older side but the overall movie did not appear to be an \"adult movie\". I feel that it tried to find a balance for kids and adults but in the end fell short for both. Some bits were too long for my taste and the plot seemed to go back and forth too much between the Barbie and the real world. I did not have high expectations but what did help me watch through the movie were the strong messages for our generation that were heartfelt and genuine.\n",

      "I'm one of those. But, I have many others in my life, who I work with and live with, and so it was great to view the world through their eyes for a couple hours and get my head around issues that impact them. It was a funny and entertaining movie. Just go to it aware that there's quite a bit of sociological dialogue. America Ferrera's soliloquy in the middle of the movie was powerful and would have been, IMO, more powerful if it hadn't been surrounded by so many others like it before and after. But the issues are complex and could not possibly be \"covered\" by just one scene, so that's understandable. It feels good to be heard, and there's a lot to hear here but nothing for men to fear. The one thing I did not like was when one male character \"admitted\" that we (men) do a better job hiding the patriarchy in modern times. C'mon. Has there been progress or not? That statement creates distrust and erases good will. There's been progress... yay! We need more progress... okay, let's go!\n",

      "Initially I wasnt so sure about how this movie would be, and whether it would overly focus on the idea of a Barbie doll, stopping it from extending to a resonant deep meaning. However, I was quickly proven wromg as we see the procession of Barbies life going from 'perfect' to 'realistic' showing us that we really are similar, makimg the movie much more pleasurable (in my eyes) and allowimg us to connect with her, them going to the human world and Ken going back with new ideas further related the movie to the real world as we felt some level of pity for Ken as he had been forced to feel this way for so long but also felt anger and confuaion as to why he was ruining this perfecr world woth clearly dysfunctional ideas, given that he knew how it felt. The ending was very satisfying as it brought closure to the topic at hand and also taught audiences a true lesson about society and the world generally, elevating it from a simple childish movie, without sacrificing the barbie feel with the various, sprinkles whimsical and funny moments which acted as a reset for the tone, without causing you to forget what had happened! A very good movie with a strong, well delivered message.\n",

      "In a fun, visually stunning, simplistic way, Barbie captures the audience with nostalgia and bright color schemes. With a plethora of Barbie styles, versions, and callouts to real accessories, Barbie proves to peak the interest of the audience and bring humor with short quips and comments by the characters and narrator. It has a strong opening that establishes the make-believe world and sets a quick witted tone to the movie, mixing slap stick comedy with deeper philosophical undertones.However, after establishing main character\n",
      "Barbie and side-kick Ken characters well, and showing a clear direction in the first quarter of the film, humor is exchanged for harsh reality in the second quarter, with no real relief or solution given to the audience. As the movie moves into the third quarter, mixed messaging seems to have feminist roots, but fails to address real issues for the common, moderate feminist. There are several chances in the film in which the main character, Barbie, can and does acknowledge the imbalance between men and women, but fails to provide a bonding, peaceful solution to the imbalance. Furthermore, it doubles down on the more radical, one sided views of modern feminism, aiming to make one gender (men) incompetent, while promoting the other gender (women) as the best leadership solution for a competently run, balanced society. At one point a main character, other than Barbie, has a minutes long soliloquy outlining all the troubles of women today, yet solutions are never presented and the end result feels more like complaining than empowerment.The last fourth of the movie seems to complete the fall away from the light heartedness of the opening, which was actually one of the strengths (and expectations) of the film. Slap stick, awkward, one liner comedy remains throughout, but while watching, the audience's confusion about the message only allows for chuckles instead of all out laughs. Some comedy ends up falling flat from obvious missed payoffs or opportunities to instill the uniting of genders as a solution. Instead, the film awkwardly seems to support the notion that one sided governance is acceptable as long as it is the side that the writers deem proper. In this case it is clearly women, but almost coldly so, as if leaving out the core feminist movement completely. If Barbie was meant to leave the audience with a feeling of hope for the future, it certainly missed the mark. On-the-nose propaganda was not what the audience came to see, but is what they received, regardless of how humorous any scene attempted to be.The best aspect of the movie are convincing performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is well over shadowed, or more accurately, over powered by Gosling's Ken. Unfortunately the character arc for Barbie was completed but underwhelming, while the character arc for Ken was expansive but confusing. Both characters seemed to miss the moral growth mark, leaving the audience wondering if any lessons had been learned at all.In summary, strong visual presence, humor, and performances kept this film from being a total flop due to the over exaggerated and misguided social commentary forced on the viewer. What should have been a light hearted, fun, uniting feel-good film, was indeed a well put together, visually stunning, mildly funny piece of propaganda for Mattel playing dress up in a modern feminist costume that only a Barbie doll could get away with.\n",

I am a girl and a feminist and this movie was all marketing, ik i'm not saying something new. It was a cute story but half of the dialogues were bad/kinda cringy. Also, many relationships were presented to us, for example the mom and her daughter, and the movie never bothered to show us a little backstory, it had potential. At least I really appreciated that the main purpose of the movie was to show women everyday struggles, loved the monologue.I think it's a nice movie, but not worth the hype like to watch it in the cinema.\n",

Values equality and shows how patriotism is harmful for both men and women, as it creates unfair opportunities and toxic stereotypes, such as sexism and how you should be as a men. People should pay attention to the movie as it can be easily misunderstood and not taken in the right way. Some people might say that it makes out men to be less valued than women. However, it used a metaphor to show how unfair the world really is , as women in reality are still considered less valuable. This movie does not support sexism and it helps both genders to realize they can be whoever they are and they are enough!\n",

      "I agree that the film is contrary to the feminist narrative. So much so that in Barbieland women rule everything and Barbie didn't want to stay there at the end of the movie, preferring real life. The men of Barbilândia, built by women, were useless and bananas, without an 'I'. This is dealt with in one of the final scenes.I thought the film brought up very deep reflections that people didn't understand. According to the film, the world of patriarchy is imperfect and so is the feminist world.The scenes of Ken declaring himself to Barbie are reminiscent of poets and their muses. At no point does he make an apology for ideology...The film is intelligent with impeccable performances.\n",

      "In this unexpected cinematic journey, \"Barbie\" takes a seemingly simple premise-a movie based on a kids' toy-and ventures into surprisingly profound territory. As a casual viewer, I found myself immersed in a tapestry of classic movie references woven seamlessly throughout the film. While some nods might have eluded me, I couldn't help but appreciate the directorial finesse in incorporating influences from cinematic legend Stanley Kubrick. These nods operated on both an artistic and nostalgic level, striking a chord with audiences of different backgrounds.The film's narrative commences with a robust start, drawing viewers into its vibrant world. However, I must admit that the conclusion seemed to lose some of its initial impact. Nevertheless, the overall experience was enjoyable, taking me and my family on an entertaining ride. Speaking of family, watching it with my wife and two sons added an enriching dynamic to the experience.Interestingly, the film defies convention by tackling thought-provoking themes that resonate with older audiences. My eldest son, at the tender age of ten, astutely observed the movie's poignant reflection on the fragility of life, encapsulated in its exploration of anxiety, depression, and mental health. Such profound subjects might fly over the heads of younger viewers, leaving them with a cheerful and colorful impression of the film. However, those of us inclined to ponder deeper meanings will uncover layers beyond what we'd typically anticipate from a movie based on a kids' toy.The comedic elements, particularly those featuring the talented Will Ferrell, added to the film's overall charm, though I'd refrain from labeling them exceptional. For me, the true allure lay in the film's willingness to embrace darker themes, which lent it an intriguing edge. Comparing it to \"Rick and Morty\" instead of \"Super Mario Bros\" feels more apt, highlighting the movie's unexpected depth and complexity.In conclusion, \"Barbie\" is a fascinating cinematic endeavor that defies preconceived notions. While rooted in a kids' toy, the film boldly delves into thought-provoking subjects, inviting a diverse audience to partake in its unexpected layers. Whether you're in it for the nostalgic references, the comedic interludes, or the contemplative exploration of life's complexities, \"Barbie\" manages to leave an impression that's both delightful and introspective.\n",

      "After seeing the movie twice, I think that a solid 8/10 is a fair rating for it. Not going to lie, I was very hyped for this movie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I think all of the bad reviews are really just people who did not understand it LOL the movie is most definitely not anti-men. I don't want to spoil it but, if anything, the ultimate message is very wholesome. The movie is funny and, by far, my favorite parts included the Kens (couldn't get \"I'm Just Ken\" out of my head for days afterwards).With that being said, my main criticism comes from the fact that it is kind of ironic that the movie is basically a 1,5 hr long commercial (to those of you who have seen it, remember Sasha's rant). The message is still good and I enjoyed the movie but, ultimately, it is a commercial. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack but imo the song at the credits just did not fit in and honestly shouldn't have been made.\n",

I feel that the performances were very forced except for Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera.....The movie tried to give a good message but it really ended up being very confusing, I expected a comedy more than a movie trying to be existential..............\n",

      "I was really excited to see this movie, and I wanted to enjoy it so badly, but it really didn't live up to the expectations. I should also probably mention that I'm a young adult and female, pretty much the target demographic for this movie. I'm also a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's projects - this one just doesn't hit the mark, sadly.It starts off quite well - the very initial scene is fairly humorous despite us already seeing it in the trailer, but it declines pretty quickly. There's too much repetition throughout the entire thing for starters; the travel montage used to indicate the characters entering Barbieland stops being funny around half way through the second roll, and was rinsed and repeated so many times that I genuinely can't remember how many times I must've watched that scene over and over. I understand the effort that went into making those individual cuts behind-the-scenes, and did appreciate the organic filmmaking that made them up, but it just felt almost too child-like for a film that was clearly pushing to be profound in a more mature context.I came away from the movie none-the-wiser as to the point of the Mattel CEO. Was he supposed to be friend? Foe? Nobody knows. There were no stakes at all involved with Barbie getting caught by Mattel - what would've happened had they put her in the box? And, with this in mind, what kind of world are we dealing with here? We know that Barbieland is readily-accessible to humans, but there was very little effort in explaining any of this to the audience. Whilst it sounds pessimistic to say this about any fantasy movie, it still just felt weird to watch.There were two particular scenes that I found fairly profound and well-done: Ferrara's character's speech and the flashback scene. The music for this movie was brilliant, especially What Was I Made For, with the exception of Lizzo's piece used earlier on which is yet another example of useless repetition (I know that this is the point of the scene, Barbie waking up to have her previously-perceived perfect day ruined, but the song was just downright odd to me and not humorous in the slightest). Ryan Gosling as Ken was, ironically, the best part of the movie for me. His singing was great, his timing absolutely phenomenal, and the dance moves fabulous! The cast in general absolutely smashed it, as did the makeup, wardrobe, and set teams behind the magic of Barbieland. Additionally, the message is very true-to-life and does tackle it well (even if Barbie still has to apologise to Ken in the end when that very much doesn't happen when the roles are reversed in the real world!).Overall, it's okay. I wouldn't say it's good, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to see it. I don't think the movie was marketed well at all, to that end. Before anyone thinks - and correctly, I might add - that this movie had more marketing than any movie released this year in terms of advertising and numorous brand deals, I'm talking about Gerwig's target demographic. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the movie being unsuitable for their children, and I agree - I was close to leaving around 20 minutes in out of sheer boredom, so god knows how a child would feel - but the marketing makes the target demographic very fuzzy indeed. I know that the movie is about breaking down stereotypes, but most of the children (and, come to think of it, the adults) in my showing did not laugh at a good chunk of the humour because it was so poorly-timed or simply not understandable for a child. The movie is very overrated, and I'm extremely disappointed that it's not what a lot of people were expecting. That being said, if brand appeal and plots made of empty air is your thing, then go for it.\n",

I feel as if many critics didn't pay enough attention to see the meanings. Even simple things and small scenes or scenes that seemed silly and meaningless, had meaning. I loved the inclusion of real classic barbies as well as discontinued and banned ones. Tons of nostalgia throughout for those who grew up and had barbies themselves. My one thing is that the movie was supposed to be for everyone, but I feel for younger children, they wouldn't understand a lot of the movie.

      "Barbie live action.Barbie live action stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and directed by Greta Gerwig. It premiered this year and tells us the dynamics of the imaginary world of Barbies and Kens with the gender roles reversed in this pink world.When she was younger, she loved Barbie. I became involved in that fantasy world created by a woman, without losing everything that characterized femininity through her appearance, her characteristic outfits, her makeup and the multifaceted talents she had. Added to this, Barbie crossed that cinematic world and it was possible for us to build our own identity through a doll. All these characteristics and more were accompanied by her identifying phrase: \"You can be whatever you want to be.\" For this reason, Barbie was and is an icon in the childhood of many, however, not everything is rosy in the world of Barbie and the live action of the film shows us this.The film transports us to this imaginary world that we all created and that we were finally able to see in reality. I love the satire that accompanies this film about how Mattel, the company that created the doll, is made up of men, who according to them, recognize the needs and demands of girls. Barbie also shows us that these demands are diverse and that each girl creates a different world with each doll she uses. This is how we meet the president Barbie, the physicist, the diplomat, the doctor, the writer and many others, but finally, it focuses on the stereotypical Barbie.Through Stereotypical Barbie we feel involved in the complexities of the female stereotype, identity crises and patriarchal oppression. This happens when this Barbie and Ken go to the real world and face the terrible news of the true influence that Barbie has had on the lives of girls. It is interesting to see how the character played by Margot Robbie questions her identity and what she reflects to others, while Ken tries to implement that macho world that she observes in reality, in the pink world of Barbie.This is how the film revolves around this gender struggle between the Kens and the Barbies, to implement their ideal world. Finally, the Barbies regain control of their reality, however, the stereotypical Barbie decides to take on the challenge of being human and face the oppressive reality that the real world represents.Finally, it is very easy as women to feel identified with what is exposed in the film, however, Barbie falls short in representing the problems suffered by non-white and non-North American women. Barbie is a feminist film, clearly, but white feminism is not something that all women identify with.\n",

But also the problems of the men, which is good because i have the feeling, that due to the fact that men are paid better and had more rights the society is more focused on the problems of the women in this wolrd and forgets about the mens problems. But this movie perfectly shows us that both genders have problems in this unfair world. Greta Gerwig really coocked here.\n",

      "The movie started well then missed a perfect chance of a beautiful empathetic ending.I was expecting that once Barbie visited the real world, she would understand how Ken felt in her world. Decide that no superiority should be instigated neither in a sense nor in another, and hence come best with a better plan of equality to show the lead for a better world. Which would have been a perfect message modern women would give.But here we got zero empathy for Ken, rather a plan to manipulate men and empower them back (that's the point?).I'm honestly surprised they get away with such an ending.\n",

      "We all have an image of perfection and perfection in our minds. But Barbie tells us from the very beginning that Barbie is more than what we usually see, she can be a woman of all walks of life and all colors, and it catches the audience's attention from the very beginning of the film.The film gave me a profound sense of shock. What moved me at first was the ease with which the characters in the story faced old age. After coming to the human world, Barbie said to the old lady she met for the first time: \"You are so beautiful\" and the old lady replied: \"I know.\" This is a real compliment, a kind of joy in life, joy in each of their faces.\"There is only one heroism in the world, and that is to see the truth of life and still love it.\" In the movie \"Barbie\" Barbie is undoubtedly a beautiful and brave existence, under her leadership, the Barbie world finally restored the vitality and vitality of the past. However, I think the film still has some deficiencies in the portrayal of group images. What we can see is that there are many other Barbie images in \"Barbie\", but most of them appear as supporting characters, as the aid of classic Barbie to promote the development of the story plot. Perhaps in future films, this aspect of the problem can be improved a bit. It allows us to see more possibilities and creativity for women.\n",

But the thing is i didn't really get the 'sad' hype that people gets from this, nonetheless, I really enjoyed how the movie talks about a lot of social issues especially the women oppression. I recommend this movie if you are really into entertainment and if you just wanna learn and talk about femininity. Really a hands down for Margot Robbie on this one. She did great on portraying Barbie and she looks just so freaking beautiful! Same goes to other Barbies in this movie- they are just so breathtaking.+ I'm not a big fan of the editing (they probably did the kiddie editing on purpose, but I'm just not a fan of that 🤷)\n",

      "Barbie is a film that stands out by defying initial assumptions, proving that it is not just a silly or ironic production. On the contrary, it remarkably addresses important themes with a lightness and clarity that are truly impressive. The storyline delves into subjects such as self-esteem, the value of friendship, and the significance of persevering in the pursuit of one's dreams. Barbie, the main character, emerges as a role model of strength and determination for young viewers, encouraging them to believe in themselves and face challenges with a smile. Furthermore, the film's high-quality animations and captivating soundtrack contribute to a visually and musically gratifying experience. Barbie pleasantly surprises audiences with its positive message, conveyed in an accessible and enjoyable manner.\n",

It's a little smarter than you expect they bring attention to a lot of societal issues still all surface level stuff though they were not discussed in a super meaningful way. However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining.

Already after the first 30 minutes the message is super clear and thats where it gets a bit empty. It fights so much against stereotypical masculinity, consumerism and capitalism but still puts a 4 minutes long chevrolet commercial (which screams how rugged the brand is) in the movie that entirely destroys the credibility of the movie.\n",

A fun film that makes you think as an adult, but that kids will also enjoy. I went with my 19 year old daughter and we laughed out loud and shed an unexpected tear.

      "This movie did a lot of things good and a lot of things bad.It left me from the theater feeling more emotions than Oppenheimer. Those emotions being anger and frustration.The movie was aesthetically very precise in the way that it felt like they had a specific vision for it. It reminded me a bit of what Toy Story would look like in live action. It leave the audience ponder over the significance of the movie, which I have heard a lot. There were a lot of moments where the film was heading in the right direction but I felt they haven't fully explored those ideas. It felt like a waste potential when Barbie goes into the real world and sees how women are \"supposedly\" treated. This is no new concept and feels a bit exaggerate and not addressing the real challenges women face in society. I feel we have pass ahead of what was being portrayed. The monologue with the mother to the Barbies did feel relatable and wish those concepts were explored a bit more than just being repeated again.When Ken brings back patriarchy to Barbieland and the barbies take it back by manipulating and tricking the Kens felt very cheap. What was the message behind that. At the end of the movie nothing changed. Barbie did become a fascist and took over Barbieland and were back to square one. Maybe that was the message, that nothing will ever change. The Ken are to Barbieland what women are to the real world.Except for stereotypical Barbie having thoughts of death and cellulite (that plotline was then abandoned and never mentioned), all the Barbies were supposedly perfect and didn't have any flaws, which is the point, but if you want to portray realistic women, why did all the barbies at the end became the same as before? There was no progress done. There was only weird Barbie that felt human since it has \"bad\" and \"good\" characteristics but it felt like she was only a tour guide than an actual character.Perhaps that's the message of the movie, that there can be no progress, which this movie was really good at getting conversations started since there are so many mixed opinionsThis whole movie also felt like a whole 2-hours long commercial on Barbie. The whole marketing campaign made it feel like you fell in the trap of what this movie was trying to avoid, capitalism consumerist society, yet the sells for Barbie will increase.The monologue with Barbie and the creator felt forced like those motivational speeches trying to force the message to the audience instead of thinking and coming to that conclusion.There were more than a few awkward moments that didn't need to be in the movie that felt unnecessary.The casting for Barbie was spot on but I would not agree for Ken. It didn't make sense for Ryan Gosling to be Ken, although no complain from the acting obviously, but just didn't fit. The hair looked awkward and distracting and wasn't a portrayal of the youth Ken.At the end, I think it's also a huge generalization and don't know if this is the right movie for feminism and equality. I expected more from this movie.\n",

As a Barbie lover, it was so much fun recognizing outfits, dolls and accessoires I used to have. I quickly realized you need to have a lot of foreknowledge to enjoy the sets and costume design etc.Now, onto the bad: the movie is so boring. None of the plot lines are well developed. All men are presented as stupid or clumsy.Barbies save Barbieland from the Kens, changing everything back to how it was before. The Kens don't even get a house in Barbieland!?I thought Barbie and Ken were going to share the house and become platonic roommates. When one of the Kens asks if they can have 1 supreme court judge, I thought they were going to let Allan be a judge. But no! Just a quip about the Kens only allowed in lower positions?Poor Allan, he was a true ally to the Barbies and he was patronized, ignored and just plain ridiculed. There were so many opportunities for the film to make it about equality and instead they went for a kind of strange revenge plot?Missed chance.The worst part: Ken was the best, most interesting character in a movie about BARBIE.\n",

      "While the Barbie movie delivers a range of colorful and diverse visuals, casting, and thematic concepts, it just fell short for me in the way of substance and execution, leaving me wanting more.The physical makeup of the Barbie movie is most definitely a strong suit within the film. The set pieces, environments, and outfits, are all adequately colorful, visually pleasing, and reminiscent of early 90s to 00s Barbie marketing. The colorful cast of both recognizable and lesser known actors creates a diverse character list which is relatively cohesive with the overall plot(s). The character designs feel unique and refreshing while also remaining recognizable throughout. The sets and props feel whimsical and fun while also providing purpose and interesting context. They honestly created \"Barbieland\" perfectly, and are able to include clever visual jokes and references. However it can occasionally feel a little random or \"on the nose\" like they're just waiting for middle aged women in the audience to go \"oh my god! I had that when I was a kid! It's Barbie!\". Marketing genius but it may get old after some time. However. Barbie's plot. This is where Barbie fell short for me. It feels like directors of the movie spent a significant amount of time shoveling money into the visuals and IMMENSE amount of marketing for this movie, and with three months left they scrambled to put together a plot for the cast and set pieces. There are multiple plots strung together very loosely that feel disjointed. Because of this, none of the thematic concepts are explored adequately and it's difficult to feel much of anything for any one of the characters. Character development happens very quickly and anytime we think we're going to receive a more complex character, their facade melts and they are revealed to be a relatively one sided representation of a specific idea or character role. Barbie: the naive stereotypical perfectionist who developed depth after very quickly coming to terms with change.. and her own mortality? Ken: the weak, insecure man reliant on a woman who develops a sigma facade to stick it to the women controlling his life - but in actuality he is wounded from her rejection. The mother: she's a mom. She has a teenage daughter who she has trouble connecting with. Where have I heard this before? The daughter: a one-sided representation of a \"woke\" teenager who's angst is never explored outside of \"she's just a moody teenager\" , despite this, it is still an integral plot line that is never developed. We are never shown the daughter's transition or possible trauma leading to her developing hatred for her extremely caring and loving parents. All of this is CONSTANTLY being shoved down our throats. None of the character development or themes are very subtle, instead opting for explicit mentions of gender roles, patriarchy, fascism, \"political correctness\" and aloof representations of men in power. While these are all great concepts to explore, they are all tackled simultaneously, and thus executed poorly. In an attempt to avoid confusion, I assume?, these concepts are constantly and directly shown to audience members - even with Ken literally learning the definition of a patriarchy in the library and having that be his motivator for the rest of the film. This easily victimizes women and strips male characters of any and all complexity - reducing them to caricaturas lacking any real substance. There were a few times where the cinematography gave the plot a moment of fresh air, adding scenic and thematic complexity, such as when Barbie first looks around in the real world and sees others experiencing human emotion, before accepting the duality of happiness and pain as a part of organic psychology. However these moments are often overshadowed by reverting character arcs or other themes deemed to momentarily be more important. All in all Barbie offers a fun story attempting introspection in multiple parts, but falls short in its execution of those deeper concepts and ideas, instead opting for cinematic multitasking of the highest degree. Many scenes don't make very much sense or contribute to the plot, but it does still offer a nostalgic exploration of childhood, growing up, and humanity. Admittedly it does have a pretty great soundtrack (Billies song may have brought a tear to my eye despite me not caring about Barbies sudden want to become human, but that's because of that falsetto, wow 😻). And Ice Spice and Niki's rendition of Aquas Barbie girl had both me and my boyfriend wanting to buss a move out of the theatre.\n",

The graphic is cheerful with the value of feminism and patriarchy, a spirit of self-identity, and about passion. I don't think children should watch this; some jokes were sarcastic yet funny for those who understand it. Children might find this movie exciting but maybe find difficulties in some parts of it.I still can say it is worth watching, but I didn't find extraordinary things in it.

The set design is amazing in the Barbie world, and this combined with the amazing wardrobe really makes you feel like this world actually could exist. These two things are a real standout for me, and is everything you could hope for from a Barbie movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play an amazing Barbie and Ken. Something I did not expect was how much I liked Michael Cera's performance as Allan. I feel like his performance gave the film as sense of awkward relief which I enjoyed. Although I touch on why I really didn't like the storytelling aspect of Barbie in the negatives section, I do like how the film builds this metaphor between the relationship of Barbie's and Ken's and the relationship of men and women.Negatives:\n",
      "Barbie is movie where you are not allowed to think for yourself. One of my favorite aspects about storytelling is it's ability to communicate a message in disarming ways. The type of movie where you buy into the message either implicitly or explicitly through exposition of the characters struggles. Movies that forgo this buy in from the audience are more or less just preaching an idea rather than trying to convince or demonstrate an idea. This is really where I have problems with the Barbie movie. While the causes pushed for in the movie are noble, they are so inelegant and on the nose it really does feel like you are being talked at through the entire movie. I cannot tell you a single theme, subtext, or message that the movie was trying to convey that wasn't also explicitly conveyed in dialogue between the characters. Consider something like the dialogue between Barbie and Ken after the Barbie's stopped the Ken's from changing the constitution after Ken returned from the human world with his new idea of patriarchy. In this dialogue, is the only way to convey the idea of not defining your self worth based on others and/or your material possessions is by Barbie saying almost exactly that, but in not so few words? Are the characters so superficial that any attempt to demonstrate that point through self reflection and/or actions would just completely fall flat? This is not an isolate incident either, I would challenge anybody to find either a theme, subtext, or any social/political statement that they movie tries to convey that isn't in some dialogue somewhere where it is almost explicitly stated as such. This issue really makes the movie feel shallow and superficial and uninteresting to watch after a certain point.\n",

It was nostalgic in terms of costumes and the set but I just didn't really understand the flow of the movie. Plus the underlying message of equality was beaten to death and honestly kinda had the opposite effect.Start of SPOILERSThe movie starts out with a funny skit on how Barbie was created/imagined. It then flows into how Barbie is perfect in every way and everyday is the same in Barbie land. Things then seem to change when the standard Barbie starts thinking about death which idk seems a little harsh for a child's toy. Like maybe an existential crisis of some sort would have been less triggering. Then the movie moves into leaving Barbie land for the real world to make Barbie happy again but it pretty much does the exact opposite. While Barbie is gone the Ken's take over and change all the Barbie things about Barbie Land. Once Barbie returns she recruits all the other Barbies they take back Barbie land.End of SPOILERSNow from a readers perspective I'm sure it's very easy to follow that summary but in the actual movie there's a lot more in between moments that just didn't really belong in the movie. And to be honest a lot of the unnecessary stuff was basically advertisement for Chevy and other brands.All in all this movie had some funny moments but was mostly a disappointment for me and I honestly regret even taking the time to see it.\n",

They make it clearly obvious in the beginning of the movie that all the kens are irrelevant in their matriarchal society, there just to accompany the barbies, so much so that they make this fact into a joke, some things happen, a patriarchal society ensues, the barbies now don't like being in the Kens old position and are shown now as being oppressed (which is now no longer funny) and change it back to a matriarchal society, where the Kens are again walked over (see them not allowed a single ken on the supreme court). They had the chance to send a clear message to the viewers that men and women could be equal and everyone gets a fair shot, but instead used the pettiness of \"women had to endure this so now men should\" approach and I did not like that message for my daughters who I teach they can do anything they put their mind to. Someone needs to teach them that we're not in the 50s no more.On a better note- the cinematography is brilliant, Margot Robbie works well with the material she has, Ryan Gosling is brilliant as usual, Will Ferral is typically Will Ferral, there's some really funny bits in there too, but don't see this movie if you want a funny escape.

In the beginning of the film, it can be thought that will go nice way with a good end and a powerful message. There is so much effort in the beginning, like building a strong idea, however this is disappered in the final. And this is such a disappointment that the film does nothing about giving an idea about liberal feminism because there is always managers as boys or girls. I think the film's main idea should be every human being no matter it is a boy or a girl can be everything they want and can be handle every situation as a human. It is ridiculous to discuss this as \"being a man or a woman\" in the 2023. In the Barbie world or in the real world it should be out of date.

I know it's weird but that's literally how it felt. The social commentary was good, but felt a little forced sometimes. I expected the movie to be another Lego Movie where the tules are completely altered, however, you'll find that it follows the same plot arch as well as direction as any other movie, but with a flair of barbie. The visuals could have been incredible based on the world they are in, and in some scenes they were really hood, but most of it is just like any other movie but with beautiful colourful sets. Overall it was really disappointing.\n",

      "Some things were super clever and made me laugh. Ryan Gosling's Ken was awesome..he was the best part. There were definitely elements I appreciated and I thought were thought provoking; however, it just felt so political and so forced. It was a huge social commentary which I think can be great but it wasn't seamlessly blended it, it was kinda obnoxious and redundant. Plot was sometimes boring and the storyline about real world meets fake world felt a little bit cliche! Certain moments were just too corny. Did I laugh though? Definitely. It had its moments. I agree with the High Highs and Low lows statements.\n",

      "For sure It failed to achieve feminism or be a criticism to patriarchy. But what to expect from Barbie and Mattel? Unfortunately, in my opinion the movie did the exact opposite thing. Setting the standards and the stereotypes for women in a non realistic level. Although Margot Robbie was delightful to watch (very classy and beautiful, perfectly representing Barbie) the general movie vibe could be a lot more fun so as to have a meaning watching it. It should last 30 minutes less in duration, and doesn't worth the hype. I am glad I saw it so as to have an opinion but it is nothing more that a typical light meaningless movie.\n",
