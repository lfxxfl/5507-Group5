2,aherdofbeautifulwildponies,26-Jul-23,before making barbie 2023greta gerwigsinglehandedly directed two filmslady bird 2017andlittle women 2019 both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence both had nuanced and layered portrayals of motherdaughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue both were very very good given those credentials one may expect barbie to be as intelligent convincing and amusing a picture  and well it isntthe fantasy comedy begins in barbie land a place where barbie played bymargot robbie is having the best day every day in the company of other barbies and occasionally kens the designs costumes and cinematography do an excellent job recreating the mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection the introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film it is smartly selfaware and presents a world where barbie can be anything  a president a physicist a journalist a lawyer or a mermaid much like with the original toys ken ryan gosling comes as an afterthought and only exists within the warmth of barbies gazethe plot is set in motion when barbie begins having thoughts about death and normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet she feels her heels hit the ground what follows isthe wizard of oz 1939journey in reverse the parallel is explicit and ultimately a pinocchio storyline of the doll in the real worldif barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit  as promised by the trailer  it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofthe truman show 1998orstranger than fiction 2006 instead the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts threats and plotlines that are never fully realised what is the nature of the connection between a barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the real world what would happen if barbie were put back in the box why is gloria america ferrera the receptionist at the mattel headquarters and later barbies realworld companion depressed  and how is that eventually resolved why is glorias daughter sasha ariana greenblatt cross with her mother why does the board of mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes most importantly the crux of the thirdact conflict  set in barbie land now renamed kendom  contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitantstowards the finale the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles one side is presented as clueless and attentionseeking while the other is manipulative and vengeful the film repeatedly takes offence with mansplaining yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience rather than on storytelling while the denouement includes one of the films highlights the musical number im just ken the ending does not resolve or acknowledge much and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensivebarbie is very easy on the eye and the acting ranges from competent to inspired with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors margot robbie is pitchperfect as barbie and ryan gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing the show situational comedy and slapstick mostly land while some of the bon mots are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by the charactersif only this were better written if only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth,0.986,positive,True
4,Natcat87,22-Jul-23,as a woman that grew up with barbie i was very excited for this movie i was curious to see how they would evolve the stereotypical barbie into something more but the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot i consider myself a proponent of gender equality and this aint the way to get itbarbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world giving women the power and leaving the kens as attractive accessories once ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to barbieland and the barbies are brainwashed this happens suddenly and without much explanation the kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance and barbieland falls into disarraythe movies solution to this is for the barbies to give a lot of ted talks on the patriarchy fool the kens into war with each other and rule once again but isnt the point if gender equality equalitythe feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so thick more humor and nuance please the story gets lost the real world characters dont add much and not much changes in the endwhat was enjoyable was the acting the sets and of course the nostalgia,0.78,positive,True
11,kayleewillis-85920,27-Aug-23,this is a movie that was way overhyped everyone kept saying it was so amazing but when i finally go to watch it it was not at all what i thought it was going to be the storyline was not good it was a basic and corny storyline in my opinioni didnt care for how they portrayed ken ryan gosling is an amazing actor but he is not a good representation of ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual ken doll looks the way he acted as ken was not that good either but he didnt get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part the movie had so much potential but was definitely a let down one positive is that it had some funny parts but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline,0.938,positive,True
14,hamsterination,19-Jul-23,the films universe and settings are fantastic the casting is really good too with gosling excelling in the role of kenregrettably however the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with barbie instead were left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women in an attempt to make it a feminist and political filminstead of seeing a light fun film i saw a rather heavyhanded movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchyits a real shame because the films potential is pretty amazing i came away disappointed but not totally disgusted either,0.9046,positive,True
16,Genti25,20-Jul-23,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,0.8029,positive,True
17,fscsgxp,20-Jul-23,ive been excited for this movie for over a year the casting was perfect and the acting was amazing the set was next level the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldnt ask for anything more from it it is perfectionthe first half of the movie was really good a decent plot plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on unfortunately after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism  how oppressed women are im a woman myself and im all for equal rights but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely it felt very forced and by the end you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post so sad spoilers ahead even more sad the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens or men are they manipulate them undermine them and then when given the chance to be better the kens asking to have one ken presented in the supreme court which is all barbies they laugh and tell them no choosing to treat the kens or men how theyve always treated women so they are no better than the kens in the end how sad isnt there a world where they can be better include the kens and all be equals what are we trying to teach young girls that feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past also i would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how hard women have it life is hard for most people men  women alike and its easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species,0.9452,positive,True
18,herrcarter-92161,23-Jul-23,my 15year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my imdb accountas a barbie fan i was very excited for this movie i was expecting a lighthearted goofy comedy instead i got a movie that felt as though it didnt know where it was going or what it was doingthe movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy then things start changingthings start going wrong for barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it she is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in barbie land this on its own wouldve been enough for a movie but it keeps goinginstead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for barbie the movie goes off in a totally different directionken sees the real worlds patriarchy and goes back to barbie land to replicate it barbie has to go back to barbie land to save it from its new patriarchyby the end of the movie barbie decides to live in the real world the kens of the barbie land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising i find the treatment of the kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movies supposed messaging about equalitythis movies writing and plot were bad even as a feminist i acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy i feel as though many of these different plot ideas couldve been good on their own they are just too confusing all togetheron a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good i loved seeing the plastic barbie houses lifesized the movie was also very funny at parts i just wish the movie picked a clearer direction,0.9566,positive,True
21,tm-sheehan,19-Jul-23,"my review  barbie
in cinemas now
my rating 6510ive been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because im a great fan of margo robbie ryan gosling and greta gerwigs worki held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and id love it or a huge disappointment and id loathe it in other words no in between for mehow ever thats not the case i didnt love it and i didnt loathe it i have to accept that i
just didnt get it perhaps its because that im a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they wont see barbiethe audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that i didnt and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusionno spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be barbie and ken leave the other barbies and kens behind in barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical barbie played to perfection by margo robbie  barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimismken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by ryan gosling joins barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at venice beach california complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of barbie land are reversed in the real world  the question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live inpink cloud sunny barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and diemargo robbie and ryan gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the filmbarbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while i hope its popular for the creators of the movie im left puzzled at what audience its aimed at the male population that greta gerwig cleverly parodies through ken and his ken buddies certainly wouldnt see her movie and i think the disney generation of under 15 would be bored i did enjoy the technical aspects of barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbusteri also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like stanley kubrics 2001 a space odysee  saturday night fever and of course the wizard of oz its one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of warner bros then in 2019 they finally announced margot robbie and greta gerwig as the lead actordirector duo for this filmdirector greta gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with noah baumbach basing their story on the famous barbie fashion dolls by mattel  it is the first live action barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success mattel the toy company that created barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in greta gerwigs clever perhaps to clever scriptmattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the oldschool charm of the barbie world intact and i suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous barbie dolls get a mention in this filmnoah baumbach is executive producer as well as his partner greta gerwig and margo robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of 145 million usmargo robbie has been quoted as saying that the films aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences the thing you didnt know you wantedim not so sure about that statement as barbie didnt reach my expectations and i felt the thing i didnt know i wanted wasnt what i wanted at alltop marks to cinematographer rodrigo prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that greta gerwig named technibarbie after the technicolor format also top marks to two time academy award winner designer jacqueline durran its a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie",0.999,positive,True
25,njamesgentry,17-Sep-23,margot robbie was born to play barbie of course shes incredibly beautiful talented funny and hip however i didnt have some lifealtering epiphany like so many others did i actually thought the film was way too cheesy 45 minutes too long and also confusing at times i love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint the idea of ken learning about misogyny and sexism essentially bringing these twisted ideas to barbieland leading all barbies to succumb to a more subservient role while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power talents intelligence and individuality but after an hour or so i kept thinking why cant barbie just sing a song i wanted a fluffier comedic barbie while what i got was a doll having an existential crisis it was depressing at times the cast was phenomenal of course i just didnt expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling,0.6146,positive,True
28,arslanmanzoor123,21-Jul-23,some friends freaking out that i went to see barbie lol i mean i mentioned i went coz my sister insisted since ages anyway the movie was bad these days every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that i wished i had gotten the ticket for oppenheimer in the same timings as my sisters barbie show other than that the acting done by margot robbie and ryan gosling was great so cant take that away from them they did justice to their roles,0.8957,positive,True
36,adamblackshaw-14445,29-Aug-23,barbie is a great example of hype over substance it is laugh out loud at times and gosling steals every scene hes in the art direction is on point what makes it tiresome is the message pummelled into the audience but then were we expecting any subtly probably not ultimately my wife just thought i already know this i dont need to hear it but maybe some women do i get her point in the end it felt like we were being sold barbie dolls as some kind of icon of feminism but seriously they are a very poor example of female role models not surprisingly mattel was one of the producers,-0.4627,negative,True
37,moviesgamesandvideos,9-Sep-23,the film does not live up to the marketing its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle there must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this filmthe music is good and the plot moves along at pace but its like it was written by an angsty tween yay feminism is about as deep as the message gets and its pretty much the entire purpose and plot of the film it doesnt offer up anything to think about just a bubblegum world that is just a carbon copy of the toyswith all the barbenhiemer hype and marketing i expected more from the movie oppenheimer and barbie are about as polar opposites of filmmaking as its possible to get,0.9337,positive,True
42,mr_bickle_the_pickle,25-Jul-23,its an incredibly fun movie lots of laughs very campy over the top humour but also surprisingly touching my favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is margot robbie shines in the lead role ryan gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role but dont sleep on michael cera as allan i know a lot of people say that ryan gosling is a scene stealer but personally i thought michael wasthe soundtrack also works really within the film i dont know how many of them i would listen to separately i also wouldnt be suprised if either im just ken or what was i made for or both was nominated for an oscar speaking of oscars i think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design costumes hair and makeup  because visually this movie is such a treatnow i dont think all aspects worked for me i dont think the mattelceo subplot was needed there could have been another way for her to go back to barbieland organically i felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this chase scene didnt add much also glorias america ferrera monologue now dont get me wrong i think there is a lot truth to it but i just found it somewhat onenote it didnt exactly blow me away as it has for others and lastly i undertstand the importance of having ruth handler featured in the moviejust a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in mattel headquartersoverall i would definitely recommend the film youll laugh youll cry youll have fun this isnt just a movie it is the moment,0.9932,positive,True
43,kk-59333,6-Nov-23,the movie isnt as fantastic as it was hyped to be its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected instead it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of girls can do anything and find yourself the most controversial aspect of the barbie character whether it exacerbates womens appearance anxiety is hardly mentioned at all in my view its essentially a reiteration of the same old themes just presented in updated ways however considering hollywoods consistent conservatism and focus on profits i appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the worlds most profitdriven film industry,0.5078,positive,True
47,Lincsobserver,10-Sep-23,who exactly was this film aimed at most of the audience when i saw it were adolescents and there were numerous perhaps too many colourful song and dance scenes which might have appealed to younger viewers but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and interrelationships that would have gone over their heads particularly as these were delivered at a frantic garbled pace there were some good comic scenes and standout performances by margot robbie and ryan gosling but as the film wore on it all became a bit preachy the message seemed to be about finding selffulfilment rather than romance okay not every film or every life has to end in a fairytale romantic coupling but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak it also makes nonsense of the final confusing payoff line of the film,0.8573,positive,True
49,Leofwine_draca,20-Aug-23,barbie is a film i find incredibly difficult to both review and rate on the face of it the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place the audience i saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable like gosling bouncing off the plastic wave and missing all of the depth which is what i personally found appealing its very hard to take such a tongueincheek approach seriously but then you could argue that its deliberately bad deliberately plasticky not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of ferrera et al despite this the films skewering of the patriarchy is spoton and gosling turns out to be very good stealing the film from the others so its a film i appreciate some parts of and not others,-0.8915,negative,True
50,MaskedMinty,21-Jul-23,"let me start by saying that im by no means a conservative or traditional woman i believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems but damnthis movie is so corporate and shallow its clearly ordered and tailored by executives at mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls the movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good but then it just goes downhill the premise of the owners feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a persons life journey and then barbie and ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching this movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling they keep repeating the same dialogues patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism not even one time but multiple times these characters go into random rants like its a ted talk the chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe you cant root for them or feel their feelings at all barbie should have understood how kens had been feeling in the barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society just existing for the gaze of a woman man yet what do they do they manipulate them with a super nonsense plan and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality i guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh
i can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this people are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the not taking itself serious bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids the only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and margot robbie and ryan gosling have acted very well besides this they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and i would have respected the creators more pass",0.9726,positive,True
52,dmmart-28624,23-Jul-23,i was pretty excited to see this film and hope im not going to get put on a list for saying i didnt enjoy it that much the message of female empowerment was fine but didnt really speak to gender equality barbieland is the opposite of real world where barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories however the ending just puts barbies back on top and doesnt do much to equality which i hope is our goal the movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up you could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there they wanted ken to take the patriarchy back to barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the kens being bumbling morons the entire movie its all payoff and no buildup good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didnt make much sense i think this was a made for tik tok movie where theres 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together,0.8972,positive,True
56,BA_Harrison,19-Sep-23,barbie margot robbie travels from barbieland to the real world where she learns to her surprise that men are in controlim not a fan of this barbie movie  regardless of whether i agree with its feminist message about the patriarchy or not i just didnt find it funny and i didnt find it enjoyable the humour was lame i thought that the performances were weak am i the only person who isnt a margot robbie fan and the songs were beyond awfulabout the only thing that i can commend about the film is its production design but even that got on my nerves from time to time the travelling to the real world from barbieland on cardboard cutouts  sheesh obviously im in the minority for not liking this film because it has a high rating and has made a mint at the box office but i guess we cant all like the same things,-0.7131,negative,True
58,fernandoschiavi,22-Jul-23,despite the strong commercial tone it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by greta gerwig director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way  although in this case it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichs the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director  in addition to margot robbie herself as a producer barbie has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today and the film does it with a big heart the story is genuinely fun with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists reserving touching moments and provoking reflections especially in its final stretch debauchery is the great ally of gerwig and baumbach to deal not only with sexism but also with the corporate issue it wont be strange if you catch yourself thinking how did mattel let this film see the light of day laughing at yourself after all seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itselfin the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the barbie universe the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project in these changes of atmosphere we were able to appreciate the creative photography by rodrigo prieto  who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit  and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices such as costume pieces type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001 a space odyssey here well catch glimpses of the wizard of oz and the truman show well go through the fairytalelike artificiality of jacques demys films for the dance and choreographic performance of gene kelly for the visual and dramatic intensity of the little red shoes and all that jazz its a lot barbie is a well of enriching cinematographic referencesbut leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look in addition to addressing important points of todays society greta gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms barbie into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism the production is very much in line with a famous quentin tarantino interview in 2021 given to bill maher on his hbo broadcast real time in which he said ultimately ideology trumps art individual effort good entertainment unfortunately in this film this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war used as a puppet by political militancy full of language allegories open messages and ideological discourses the film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone to be a comedy and romance epic and it had the quality to do so but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrolthe film has an interesting premise thats undeniable and it flows most of the time but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn since the target audience here is females of all ages this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy criticism of beauty standards the hypocritical discourse against consumerism as if warner mattel artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales from selling new dolls etc manhatred all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idits gredy dmb or wanting power for themselves greta gerwigs goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard because the stereotyped barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy  the character sasha played by ariana greenblatt is the one who plays this role like the militant of today always connected and who knows everything about life where gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentionsthe truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate not love barbie here hates men capitalism fun and hates barbie doll herself calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll if youre a woman and you played with her as a kid according to the movie you supported patriarchy barbie cant just be a pretty blonde thin woman either after all that doesnt encompass the mandatory diversity and inclusion in hollywood today to resolve this issue they created a universe in which everyone is barbie we even have a barbie who was born a man yes a trans barbie  who by the way is a doctor the men in barbieland who cares are there to be mistreated and ignored ken is just an accessory when barbie and ken come into the real world everything changes ken discovers patriarchy a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot and likes that world barbie finds unbridled machismo if barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense romance between barbie and ken not at all after all that wouldnt be empowering at all ken even rejects the doll at one pointken represents the evil patriarchy everything in this film becomes one big lecture one big sermon barbie scolding workers who whistle at her police officers harassing barbie at the police station a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue that is victim of the toxic men of the world barbie still has to choose between flipflops and heels showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made follow feminism that is flipflops we also have the passage of the protagonist gloria cheating on her husband a fool by the way and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheatingall male clichs are portrayed here according to the feminist view because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time according to the films script here the barbies were coopted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the kens in a kind of macho dystopia everything ken likes is depicted as toxic evil and terrible stallone godfather horses zack snyder etc barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women women have everything men have nothing mattel executives are all portrayed as white straight men and still calls this type of profile conservative fascist for the director it is never enough to be a woman you have to be a mother a wife work and still receive criticism the unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies and that they cannot study work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work yes because apparently the evil businessmen hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job at the end of the plot glorias feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy kens are beaten because they are dmb the barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective ken jealous with another ken of course after all all men only know how to create wars destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid after all if men are stupid why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film a basic and inexplicable plot hole herebarbie is a great satire but when it touches on feminist issues it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men since women are portrayed as being totally perfect sasha and gloria are the main latin characters here and the barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas obviously the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and of course the popularity of the barbie doll that has been successful for generations in addition to having many merits especially in the technical part the detailed creative and extremely tasteful scenarios especially in barbieland are a spectacle in themselves in addition to the magnificent performances by margot robbie charismatic and incredibly beautiful and ryan gosling hilarious as ever the musicals on the other hand are horrible poorly performed and owing a lot in that regardbarbie talks about choices and changes in the hands of greta gerwig the typical behavior of dolls and dolls via imagination takes on a critical form and points to many paths visiting metalanguage politicalsocial relations patriarchy and feminism feelings including the arrogant and insensitive posture of barbie in front of ken as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend existential crises or acceptance of ones social and gender condition the work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a liveaction barbie that is undeniable the problem is that in the end barbie doesnt even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of selfdiscovery who is barbie,0.9966,positive,True
61,jboothmillard,1-Aug-23,the first barbie fashion doll was released by mattel in 1954 there have been several straighttodvd computeranimated cartoons but it has taken 64 for a liveaction movie to be made this was one of the most hypedup movies of the year i certainly couldnt ignore it directed by greta gerwig lady bird little women basically the film opens with the narrator dame helen mirren explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of barbie a parody of 2001 a space odyssey and how barbie came to change the world barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living barbie and ken dolls reside all the women are selfconfident selfsufficient and successful while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach all barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors lawyers journalists pilots astronauts and politicians stereotypical barbie margot robbie lives her best life all day every day while her onoff boyfriend ken ryan gosling is only happy when he is with her and she shows him some attention ken seeks a closer relationship but barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships barbie holds one of her regular parties at her dreamhouse which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality the following day barbie finds her regular routine has altered her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite her friends including writer barbie alexandra shipp physicist barbie emma mackey and lawyer barbie sharon rooney tell her to visit weird barbie kate mckinnon a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly giving her permanent splits and felttip pen drawn on her face weird barbie tells her to cure her affliction she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her weird barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option a parody of the matrix driving her pink convertible outside of barbieland barbie finds ken stowed away he insists he is coming with her and she reluctantly agrees barbie and ken travel by car by boat by rocket by bicycle by campervan and by snowmobile all deliberate cutout scenarios until they arrive at venice beach los angeles california the two cause a stir while exploring including with their colourful rollerskating gear and blades then changing into cowboy outfits at toy manufacturer mattel the creators of barbie the allmale board members are informed that barbie has entered the real world the ceo will ferrell orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box at the local school barbie encounters a tween girl named sasha ariana greenblatt who criticises barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women meanwhile ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses it is through

cameo performers are terrific and the voice of mirren occasionally breaking the fourth wall is great gerwig and her cowriterreallife partner noah baumbach frances ha marriage story were given full creative freedom for the script they are unafraid to poke fun at the barbie world including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys and interesting ideas of feminism body image female empowerment the battle of the sexes and the human experience the visuals are sugarcoated and saturated with colour pink obviously most prominent with impressive set and costume design and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs pink by lizzo dance the night by dua lipa the original barbie girl by aqua does not feature there is the new version by nicki minaj and ice spice with aqua and fun song and dance routines it could have been a conventional girly barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy very good,0.9993,positive,True

71,michelle-kissler,21-Jul-23,this film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast stunning costumes and iconic character however it failed to live up to expectations falling flat just like spoiler barbies heelsthe script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their barbie dolls evoking a sense of nostalgia barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields including stembased jobs she helped promote young girls interest in science engineering math and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields barbie encouraged girls to dream big fostered a love for learning and promoted selfconfidencebarbie symbolizes beauty and fashionforwardness allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls playing with barbies also promoted emotional intelligence empathy creativity and problemsolving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in roleplayingregrettably this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional barbie doll instead of embracing themes of friendship teamwork feminism and selfdiscovery the film failed to deliver the friendships between the barbie characters felt superficial lacking depth rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances theres a monologue by america ferreras character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today i thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman but it never didin the spirit of equality i also had high hopes this film would promote barbie and not just a girls toy but a great toy for any kid girl or boy it didnt go there at allone aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of barbie and kens relationship which verged on being toxic it was evident that barbie did not reciprocate kens feelings creating an uncomfortable dynamic the movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others feelings ken was extremely codependent and barbie just saw him as an accessory yet when the tables were turned she didnt really learn anything from thatin terms of humor the movie fell short of expectations most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact additionally the ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place adding nothing substantial to the plotline it came across as awkward and disconnected failing to contribute meaningfully to the storyoverall the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewersadditionally barbies journey of selfdiscovery felt underwhelming culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologists office it would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that barbie stands for with the real world friendship kindness perseverance selfexpression and imagination sure shes ordinary realworld barbie but that doesnt mean she cant have extraordinarily character the story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audienceoverall i had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book,0.9971,positive,True
75,dililith,13-Aug-23,it is funny it is deep it is nostalgic it is not about romance it is all the things the doll was meant to bethe narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush womens selfesteemthe movie is entertaining  it makes you laugh has so many characters you barely get to appreciate all of them i dont particularly love gosling as ken i find him too old for the role but plays well the partnow the important thing about the movie is the concept the whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant it is light enough so you dont get an existencial crisis while watching it but youll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problemthat scene with the old lady is endearing the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener and ohh that final joke bonus points for that endingwill definitely what again,0.8694,positive,True
95,cjgvfpkx,8-Aug-23,but damnit it was great the opening scene was good then the first scene in barbieland worried me not worried me like it would be bad but that i would be right that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top and it was that too but its a surprisingly serious movie in theme not execution but it says a lot of quiet parts out loud what we did with our barbies to them who is ken anyway why is ken what is death and why does it matter what is motivation and what is success what is feminism and what is dementia t progress honestly i would have thought you were blowing my horn and that sounds fun for a friday night but this is worth it and a good movie to brave the theater for the link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit upalso no spoilers but the ken bonfires scene made me actually laugh out loud and i love comedy but almost never laugh out loud,0.9937,positive,True
96,trinculodino,19-Jul-23,a good laugh of a film poking fun at mattel complicating the concept of barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and its inherent incompatibility with human emancipationthe irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion one might argue this is not the case since it is mostly kens that are depicted this way but since the kens behaviour are supposed to reflect the human females experiences of men in general that argument falls flatin short enjoyable film but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing,-0.0258,neutral,True
99,enigma49,20-Jul-23,first of all margot robbie is great in the role of barbie and i also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish both the pink dominated barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinionunfortunately there isnt much more to the movie than that the story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women thats it thats allthe story revolves around the word patriarchy with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween none of which really worked for me whats left is the empty feeling of lost potentialthe main plot element of the first few minutes the fact that barbie suddenly isnt perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection that sounds interesting right is almost completely ignored in favor of what i pointed out above the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this perfect barbieland in the first case yes theres the running gag with will ferrell as a ceo and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best it will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story if youre lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mindthen in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues how can anyone enjoy this 410 for the style and the acting,0.9867,positive,True

112,EUyeshima,15-Aug-23,theres a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director greta gerwig manages with stylish aplomb she and partner noah baumbach have taken the barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time however this is neither a treatise nor a polemic its still primarily a fun freewheeling farce with dayglo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective margot robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical barbie ryan gosling gives ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity the rest of the cast appear equally game gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candycoated girlhood memory,0.8885,positive,True
117,madelynmcfly-20274,27-Aug-23,i identify as both barbie and ken this is one of the most beautiful films ive ever seen and it even made me cry this film is such a raw yet humorous look at how hard life is as well as gender and everything that falls under that from how the patriarchy hurts both men and women how hard it is to live and not be exceptional and the ideas at play in life i loved the costume and set design it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of barbie i feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous the soundtrack is also an amazing piece here ive seen this film twice and it has truly affected my life incredible,0.9794,positive,True
120,susand1108,18-Aug-23,this movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting the script is quite clever and fun and get this there is not one word of profanity this just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be wellwritten and need not have dozens of fbombs i give it even more bonus points for good actors who dont mumble i was beginning to think that todays actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box how refreshing to hear every word though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment this is not a movie just for women my husband enjoyed it very much young children wont get most of it but they might enjoy the visuals highly recommended,0.9655,positive,True
122,Imaculata,30-Jul-23,the barbie movie is a very mixed bag it tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor margot robbie does a fantastic job as barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of barbies world where its houses are all open and have no stairs and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries all that works fantastic but mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo which makes for a strange mix it isnt until after the first act where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys that it kind of falls apartthe barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience even men to think about but if you are a male viewer and if all you took from this movie is that it hates men then you completely missed the point the movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be it pokes fun at it while never completely turning against barbie as a product this is a barbie movie after all that this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film is a good thing including criticizing gender stereotypes but the execution leaves more to be desiredthere is plenty to critique about the barbie movie that is valid the barbie movie tries to do a lot of things and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess the movie could have benefited from a bit more focus instead it is all over the placejust the plot of barbie and ken being confronted with the real world probably would have been enough for a whole movie but to the movies credit it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a barbie movie i would argue too muchtheres the plot of mattel trying to capture barbie with the awkwardness of a mattel product what this movie is critiquing mattel it never feels entirely earnestthen theres the plot of barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her this plot works the best but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going onthen theres the side plot of barbie meeting her creator which at first feels like a random easter egg but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie without really fitting in with all the other plots the barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not at first it seems as if barbieland is the place that is magical and unrealistic which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor once barbie and ken visit the real world the contrast leads to more humor but then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world and things become very messy such as mattel having a mysterious floor where barbies deceased creator is still alive this is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line but that doesnt quite explain it either the movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building it was a side plot we didnt need in the first placethen there is the plot of ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes and then bringing all that back to barbieland this plot feels a bit disjointed it ends up dragging the third act back to barbieland when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act everything with barbie trying to make the other barbies remember who they are and revisiting ugly barbie should have been cut it feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going onall in all it is a bit of a mess storywise this script could have used a bit more editing also it ends on a joke about barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist which is a bit of low hanging fruit when you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls this is probably not the line should end on suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more senseas a comedy movie you cant aim for a high bar story wise when your movies comedy is aiming for the lowest bar it doesnt seem to work,0.8274,positive,True
133,mDanHam,11-Nov-23,the opening sequence is such a precise deadon parody of 2001 a space odyssey that i had to give that segment alone an a which factored in to my overall rating and upped it a notch actually the first fortyfive minutes to an hour of barbie is pretty funny with some good satire and surprisingly dark undertones like stereotypical barbie mysteriously having thoughts about death so that helped tooproblem is when barbie  ken margot robbie  ryan gosling journey to the real world the social commentary turns too serious and practically grinds the movie to a halt sometimes youre not sure if its still parody or if theyre trying to make a statement and that pretty much takes the fun out of itbarbie is best when it makes fun of all prevailing gender stereotypes instead of zeroing in on how women are oh so burdened being as they are unfairly expected to be all things to all people  yada yada yada giving the former ugly betty america ferrera an opportunity to lecture us on the subject by delivering a preachy monologue there are a few noteworthy moments in the second half involving a ken insurrection a kensurrection perhaps and a side note on barbies origin with a nod to the dolls reallife creator ruth handler rhea perlman but by then the damage has been donewatch the first hour for incisive clever satire after that beware of banality or if youre a movie buff at least watch the first five minutes,0.8259,positive,True
140,SexyActorsJunkie,24-Jul-23,i went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because come on who is more perfectly beautiful to portray barbie than margot robbie and whos more attractive to be ken other than ryan goslingthis movie was too long too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children which is odd since its about the most iconic doll of all timethe creation of the barbie world was awesome sets and props but the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didnt impress and neither did the resolution of the story how about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble also they didnt have to pointedly throw in that barbie was drinking cow milk cow on the label in all caps are the writers anti vegan at least they mentioned in the film to the audience that ken was wearing faux fur but it was like a condescending little note because i guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows anyways the best parts of this movie were ryan gosling all the way gorgeous funny singing and dancing the conflict between the two alpha kens and introducing me to simu liu and issa rae despite its flaws im glad i followed the hype and saw this movie but i doubt i could sit through it again its just too silly and canned preachy,0.9748,positive,True
141,spiderman-55910,17-Sep-23,the movie starts off great and has hilarious jokes throughout for me ryan gosling stole the show as he had the funniest lines and scenes some folks are mad about the womens empowerment themes not me men have treated women as less than equal since the dawn of time who are we to complain when they rightfully mock that i dont mind the shots at the patriarchy or even the fact that theres not one intelligent male character in the entire thing what i dont like about this movie is barbies existential crisis its like they forgot the audience majority are children and it feels like a pathetic bid for an oscar that arc was as offputting as it was unnecessary had that element been replaced with more humor or at least a wholesome resolution i wouldve given it a much higher score they just took it to a place where its less relatable for the children watching,-0.2725,negative,True
142,mollyt-73422,16-Aug-23,this movie is not for people who cry a lot it was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic goldstarting with barbie land it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy while the barbies are in control there is a lack of violence between the kens and the barbies the most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between ryan goslings ken and simu lius ken although the kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like beach which is a role reversal of the human world barbies entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see barbie spiral out of controlside note the whole concept of weird barbies house is amazing the discontinued barbies and kens are hilarious especially when you realise their backstoriesthen the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through we also see barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit this is when ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more the sequences in the human world arent as interesting as barbie world but still keep you hooked inthen going back to barbie world we see kens patriarchy unlike the barbies matriarchy it is completely toxic the barbies are all maids and stupid only ever caring for the kens and then the kens actually start a war with eachother over the barbies however the kens are actually stupid and clearly dont see what they want ryan goslings ken then explains to barbie that he didnt like how he was treated before and he doesnt like the world hes built for himself now and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world the barbies still run everything but they give the kens more opportunities the kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions this is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote nowfinally the ending where barbie is taken away by ruth is beautiful this made me cry the most watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out this movie is a masterpiece and deserves the oscar this year more than any other,0.3675,positive,True
143,martinpersson97,17-Aug-23,i hope you wont let the title of the film fool you this is not some family movie for little girls it is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great greta gerwig and an instant classic cult filmit provides some excellent comedy and at the same time some very clever contemporary commentary on feminism and patriarchy from both sides in gerwig and baumbachs usual styles very wellwritten overallthe cinematography is very uqique one might say characteristic from gerwig but it has its own unique weird twisted style to it and i love itoverall a very fun film that is certainly deserving of all the praise and hype it has gottenlike last years everything and everywhere all att once this is truly a genrebending experience that i very much hope make it to the oscars it is both an incredibly fun and important film,0.9918,positive,True
145,mieriks,19-Jul-23,this movie about barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence is a good fantasy moviei liked the concept and it reminded me of the toy story quadrilogy 19952019 the dolls were living dolls but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours the sense of humor were present and i noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways its satire was well used and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime the attention to details was fantastic because of the script the action the minor details like eating and drinking and last but not least the sets and the effects  every visual element basically the characters behaviors were like they were controlled by kids but we didnt see the kids hands or like that they acted like they were played with and that was well executed i thinki think the story was alright the outer story in the first and third act was good the beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of barbie and how barbie has affected people before but also how barbie should affect us in the right way today its all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others shoes because thats how to live as a realistic selfcontrolled being the second act is a big part of a movie and i got mixed feelings about that act in this movie it had its meanings but i think much of what happened especially in los angeles was sometimes messy and unnecessary it was much smalltalk and i sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time anyway it didnt ruin the overall experiencein conclusion this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story the attention to detail from the script to the visual elements enhances the overall experience the movies satirical approach appeals to both children and adults making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences while the outer story is wellcrafted the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing nevertheless the movies exploration of barbies impact on peoples lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable despite minor flaws the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others,0.9977,positive,True
146,gilliandawe91,10-Aug-23,wow i saw this movie on july 23rd and ive been thinking about it ever since right off the bat the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design the backdrops the houses all of the set decoration in barbieland is perfection all of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative i would love to believe that barbie can help usher in a new era where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage without so much cgi set dec is 1010next i have to talk about greta gerwigs clear love of cinema from the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001 a space odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed to a hilarious matrix reference and then the overarching clear love of old hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals the dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute blastthen there is the acting it almost feels wrong to say it but theres no denying that ryan gosling steals every scene he is in his comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we havent gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty margot robbie is absolute perfection the most obvious casting for barbie ever in the history of the world but dont let that fool you her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here she really is one of the best actor of this generation the rest of the cast also absolutely kills it america ferrera simu liu kate mckinnon michael cera will farrell etc etc etc everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance acting is 1010the music it is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original barbie album for this film im not always a hard pop music kind of person but it went so perfectly with this film that i had to order myself a vinyl copy but best of all ryan goslings performance in im just ken the dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious i can only pray that it is nominated for best original song at the oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem can you imagine it music is 1010and finally the script see how i managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on this script is hilarious so smart and witty and deeply poignant and emotional it hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years i love that even though barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywherei personally did not find that to be the case for me i was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll all of her careers the fact that there was an astronaut barbie before there was a woman working at nasa etc then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy if anything in this movie seemed false or offended you i dont even know what to tell you this felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman so many women have shared america ferreras monologue and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie and i say that as a big matchbox twenty fanall in all this movie for me is a masterpiece its stunning hilarious emotional and the most fun i may ever have had in a movie theatre cannot recommend strongly enough easily my favourite movie of 2023 cant imagine how anything else could come close,0.9993,positive,True
147,misscattik,7-Aug-23,the title of the review practically sums it all up with the highest potential in style aesthetics cast and concept the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of its main idea and its not feminism that bothers surely not its the artistic language in which the idea is told  harsh manipulative abusive straightforward and unkind instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect it shoves the manifestations down your throat and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watchhowever the opening scene is great if you know the reference of course and there are some funny moments but they seem to go against the general idea rather than to support it,0.1396,positive,True
148,jace_the_film_guy,30-Aug-23,"i saw this movie a month ago and ive had a hard time gathering my thoughts for a review i think that i need to give it another watch that being said my reaction from my first viewing is mixedon one side there are so many positives about this film the casting is spoton with margot robbie and ryan gosling perfectly fitting their characters the visuals in barbie world are vibrant and exciting the humor is excellent and made me genuinely laugh out loud not to mention the brilliance of allanon the other side the film has an agenda and they push it hard the message of female empowerment is strong but at times it crossed over into preachy territory my theater hardly laughed and the entire row in front of me walked out about 34 through while i loved the moments in barbie world i did not enjoy the scenes in the real world or anything with will ferrellat its core this movie is a powerful reminder of what life is like for a woman ie america ferreras monologue and a call to action for me unfortunately the inyourface approach might alienate some rather than inspirebest character ken though allan was brilliant
best quote to be honest when i found out the patriarchy wasnt just about horses i lost interest  ken
best scene the intro to barbie world
best song im just ken",0.9956,positive,True
149,JonathanWalford,24-Jul-23,the movie has a very clever intro a charming setup filled with sight gags and some hilarious lines especially those spoken by the narrator  helen mirrenhowever its essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men the kens and when they discover they are only disaffected props they create a toxic patriarchy although we never see how they do it the barbies then manipulate the kens using feminine wiles and playing dumb to coerce the kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submissionadding to a magnum of plot holes and an ending that takes way too long is a weird pinocchio twist when barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vaginathis film panders to a pseudofeminist audience if you want to see a film where feminism is funny and wins in the end see legally blonde,0.9134,positive,True
153,ianshumway,22-Jul-23,for starters this movie was made by women for women i was not the intended audience which is fine but i feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here or there could have been one that everyone could have really likedthe movie is well made i could tell that the people who made the movie liked barbie and knew their stuff and that bleed into the movie it has a cool set lots of creative choices and has good actors with some genuinely funny gags and jokesthe cons some movies are great pieces of art where you cant nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say the classic disney movies like beauty and the beast peter pan pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themesthen there some films like atlas shrugged where you know exactly what its trying to say from the getgo this is one of the those films except it doesnt just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another this film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it upi dont think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be and it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical and all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way there was even this car chase scene in middle which i believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for chevroletalso there were some very weird parts of the movie where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways ill just give one example and finish on that at the end barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have but she is wrong everything she listed werent women problems they were people problems thats life i sorry but its not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss go talk to machiaveli these are problems everyone hasanyway thats my review i hope its balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is ,0.9918,positive,True
155,sandy777,21-Nov-23,barbie a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends what could go wrong a lot apparently it started with voice over narration and went downhill from there there was too much telling rather than showing most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how i should feel about it the writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles there were some funny moments but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle i never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing the story lacked stakes i didnt care about barbie or ken in the right hands this movie could have been fun but barbie didnt seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell,0.791,positive,True
158,anthonywltrs,21-Jul-23,this movie wow just wow this was unlike anything i had expected going in to seeing barbie earlier today i figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between barbie and ken with it ending with them getting together beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterboy was i wrong holy moly barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking at least to me it was deep and thought provoking i mean seriously this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times but the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following  self identity discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life it is ok to be imperfect to be weird kooky dark its ok to not live up to anyones expectations in life or those around you just be you and only you self love willing to accept change even if you dont like it theres also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixits funny heartwarming filled with unexpected surprises and im sure for all the hardcore barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant moviemargot robbie and ryan gosling did an exceptional job as barbie and ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time ryan gosling as ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as ken,0.9931,positive,True
159,abeburnett,21-Jul-23,oppression is a state of mind even when objectively you are oppressedthe biggest problem with this movie is that it leans hard into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by men as if were some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugatedtalk about intellectually lazy and the only acceptable man is an allen wimpy effeminate man this movie couldve provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes or how men and women complement each other but no instead in the final act it chooses sides and the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side the equity side the side of well do unto others as you feel in your hyperoppressed feeling state theyve done unto you you feel like the kens have done you wrong so you oppress them in return never mind the barbies oppressed the kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie and the entirety of the first act but no the kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay equity demands retribution so all men excuse me kens must paywhile i laughed and enjoyed the first two acts in the end i felt thoroughly disappointed angry nauseated if they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it wouldve been a 1010 but they couldnt resist making it propaganda i guess the jokes on me for taking our girls to italso theres a monologue in the third act which couldve been brilliant if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how all humans feel not just women men too every man ive ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society from women from other men its not just a woman thingoh and then the last 510 minutes or so were almost like a different movie it just didnt line up with who barbie was and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occurin the end this ken me cannot recommend this film to other kens unless youre the kind of liberal  progressive man who believes the whole women are oppressed narrative then youll probably love it every other guy though or the women who love them id recommend taking a pass on this one or watch the first 75 and then leavebottom line this is every bit as toxic as some forms of masculinity this is just toxic feminism and i say that as a feminist,0.9106,positive,True
161,neil-476,26-Jul-23,everything is perfect in barbieland every day is identikit pink perfection for all the barbies and also for the kens as long as theyre getting attention then stereotypical barbie starts getting dark thoughts which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the real world so accompanied by ken barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human only to find that the real world is not at all like barbieland and ken discovers patriarchy and horsesas a film this is an enjoyable mess it aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages escapist silliness wild fantasy social satire with wellstaged musical production numbers in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdnt work together but somehow do its bright colourful tuneful quite funny well played sometimes thoughtful and thoughtprovoking mikdly feminist though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity and broadly goodhearted helen mirrens narration is dry and funny and the last line is a killerlooking at the film as a social phenomenon i have two observations one a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie about dolls this film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is and its certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is two the cinema was packed twothirds female and the audience seemed to enjoy it the only films i have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences no comment,0.9807,positive,True
163,zoeyrea,27-Jul-23,i have seen this film in theaters twice now and i can safely say that i thought it was amusing entertaining and fun however i wont lie to you and say that its really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim while this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow i am not saying that this wasnt a great film as said before it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a good movie with now i cant say that i wasnt entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something the longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient people that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and womens issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner however i feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone the creators of barbie stated that this was an everyone movie that this film was designed to cater to all viewers but did it have to the laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message dont get me wrong all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation even after watching the movie twice i still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of barbieland where is this really set why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world why do barbies know theyre toys i might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused overall i think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating i really didnt want this movie to be below a 9 i was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to do anything to see it in theaters again but it turned out to be just ok a word i can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic but it just fell flat in that department would i recommend yeah why not but would i jump at the opportunity to see it again ever probably not,0.976,positive,True
167,walfordior,30-Jul-23,barbie is no longer just a toy rather this idea of barbie has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time it is so much more than merely a toy it will not longer be just a toyi must admit as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing i had my doubts so many things scanned through my head one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a comedy and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me boy was i wrongwhere do i startto start off with this is not just a comedy movie would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedythis movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot a plot that touches everyones heart a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the moviebarbie focuses on the story of stereotypical barbie  ken barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue when reading this plot it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy action simple film etc however this is only the plot the storyline is very differentthe opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood stereotypes a new generation etc with barbie margot robbie appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film it is is symbolic in the sense that the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with it may also represent girls smashing or declining their dreams due to female stereotypes a topic that is heavy in this film  i liked that gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightlygood comedic scenes are present throughout the film such as the jokes about alan however even though alan being on his own and not many people caring about alan are seen as comedy  i feel that there is much more behind alan and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier and that gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall that being alan may represent women in the sense that in this maledominant world women are constantly feeling pressured and alone and not listened toi like how gerwig didnt make a whole new concept of barbie this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity i particularly liked how when barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car this was symbolic as when young children play with barbies that is how they get their barbie doll down too they bring the barbie down as if it is floating i really liked this detail had innocence to itfurther on in the movie the topics start to get heavier for example when barbie meets sasha sasha described first world problems such as feminism here gerwig had suddenly brought in these topics without warning again i liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding womens rights and how quick this world is to judge womenkens storyline was also an intricate part of the movie the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on ken wanting to not just be ken and barbie but wanting to feel important in the end ken realises that he is important too gerwig does this really well although this movie highlights topics relating to womens rights the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal and that was a nice message to finish the film offthe ending montage of childhood barbies children etc was a really heartwrenching moment a great way to end the movie gerwig played with emotions here spectators started off the movie laughing and ended in crying great way to showcase opposing topicsall in all fantastic movie,0.9972,positive,True
170,tiannac-75060,1-Aug-23,when i first heard about this movie i didnt want to see it then i watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly margot robbie as barbie could not have been a better casting choice ryan gosling as ken was just chefs kiss its a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast its charming funny touching powerful and overall perfect the soundtrack is fantastic ive been listening to im just ken on repeat for days now the diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one greta gerwig and everyone who worked on this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park,0.9911,positive,True
172,madisonsolomon,6-Aug-23,this movie made me laugh and cry it was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls while still poking fun at it all it also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers i personally wouldnt show this movie to a child too young as there are a few jokes about how barbies dont have genitals one bleeped f word and a few mentions of beer it was a little depressing but overall very inspirational despite of course the discussion of misogyny i laughed through the whole thing it was hilarious it addressed also how adult womenmothers feel self conscious about not being perfect it was beautiful and id watch again,0.9663,positive,True
174,gokulmadhu-37537,23-Jul-23,this movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and onthe only relief is honestly ryan goslings ken who made me crack up multiple times and he lives as ken to be honest there is no ryan gosling anymore its just ken and he was the protagonist for methey really show men as cowardly stupid needy power hungry and so on and on when they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown like come on as if its not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism you would at least think they would go for true equal rightsthe thing which actual feminists used to fight for at the very end but nooo the men get satisfied with just 1 seat in that institution instead of it being half and half,0.1088,positive,True
175,hmbrisbo,26-Jul-23,this might just be the best movie ive ever seen the more i think about it the more i realize just how genius it is i mean they really thought out every little detailmy favorite part is that if you love this movie you get the movie and if you hate the movie you also get the movie it truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it its for everyoneid like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment we start off in a matriarchal society however its a society created by little girls so the barbies are not violent towards the kens they just arent obsessed with the kens the kens are just in the background this is representative of how children girls feel then we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society but not just any patriarchal society its a society created by adults so we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies then we go back to barbieland and ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him he creates a toxic meninist movement which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer we cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes the kens start to become violent even towards each other this is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world we cant even rely on each other sometimes women can be hateful towards each other as well finally the movie comes to a close with barbie taking a small step in the right direction she says it doesnt have to be barbie and ken its barbie and its ken now heres were people start to get pissed barbie just got done saying that the barbies and kens need to start living as equals but when when of the kens asks to be on the supreme court the president barbie says no thats too far lets start with maybe a cabinet member or something wow how could they just kidding youre supposed to be angry about this this is an accurate representation of the real world the movie literally ends with the barbie world being an exact replica of the real world only with the gender roles reversedanother thing id like to point out is that even ken says at the end that he didnt really like patriarchy anyway he just wanted to ride horses again this is because he is a doll in a world created by children i think theres a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the pov of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything even mattel is kind of shown as a bad guy in the movie but even they say they didnt make barbie for her to become a sexualized standard they made barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother with barbie they can be anything they want to be it wasnt until adults came along and taught us to sexualize barbie that we started to hold her to a different standardi think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it i think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it every person ive see criticizing this movie im like youre so close to the point youre basically running head first into it that is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie its a trap you cant say hateful things about it without proving the point of the movie,0.7437,positive,True
195,atomeckova,23-Jul-23,to me barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men i wasnt really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time it pains me how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and funmen aside i do think it healed something in me however clich it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it would definitely show it to my future daughter if i planned to have one i think its an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else 3,0.877,positive,True

197,yftdmvzz,5-Aug-23,this is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever the plot is forgettable and alot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate the kens were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them also the barbies had no objection to the kens instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought they were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side characters superficial problems to bring them to their senses these issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly the movie has some plus points being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8 ratings an excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter wait for this one to release on dvd or streaming platforms,-0.8836,negative,True
200,huey2088,11-Aug-23,i was never into barbie as a child because i thought shes just a boring toy the operative word being  toy so when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist sky high beauty standards white skin and blonde hair i thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because theyre just jealous at someone elses success its easier to blast someone elses hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing itthe way children perceive toys remain unchanged a young child who picks up a barbie will not immediately think if at all they must aspire to have the dolls physique children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination they dont think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy the politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest ruth handler created barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll she wasnt into politics or trying to change cultural standardsgerwigs barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many many lectures to the masses the movie looks like its for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite this is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control pointing out that its a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiotsthe portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping barbie robbie goes into the real human world and shes heckled by men at the beach and if thats not a clear enough message she visits a construction site where you guessed it the men starts to make derogatory comments as well then theres the mattel hq where its of course run by men in suits who are naturally idiots one of the lower ranked male employee swindells even say im a man with no power does that make me a woman whats with half of the sex education actors cast in this movie the brilliant ncuti gatwa playing a hetero kenat just under two hours you can guess why that is  theres not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point youre wondering if this is a movie or a music channel the second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boringrobbie and gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given barbie is an iconc doll and thats all she is a toy  so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining and in case youre so numb from all the preachiness the trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many isms as possible by using barbie as a prop,0.9375,positive,True
212,liefie2000,20-Jul-23,how did i go to watch barbie only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health the plot made no sensefor someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics it was a disappointment most women like to watch feelgood chick flicks as an escape from reality and for the same reason girls like to watch barbie but it was nothing like that and instead i left the cinema feeling literally depressed as a little girl not a single part of me thought the old barbie movies presented a barbie who wasnt a strong figure and yes you can be strong while being in lovethe way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art but the plot made no sense despite them trying to constantly spoonfeed it to usin barbie land the women the barbies are in charge and have everything while the men the kens are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies they dont even have houses when barbie enters the real word she realises its the complete reverse youd think that barbie would then realise that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens then go back to barbie land and fix it instead when she goes back to see ken turning barbieland into kenland because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to manipulate the kens into fighting each other so they can take back their power then instead of apologising to ken who was genuinely in love with her and had no true bad intentions the entire movie  he thought the patriarchy was about horses about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds she simply apologises for not spending some time with him then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to find himself then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect  and i get what theyre trying to achieve here but i thought there would be a deeper reason perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable such as having empathy or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulitei get the intention of the movie but it really didnt have to be that deep i really just wanted to have fun at a barbie movie the last thing youd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women politics patriarchy death depression and anxiety the beginning of the film was fun but that fun didnt last long but people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals,0.8813,positive,True

224,jgeorge4,22-Jul-23,this was a very fun very engaging premise i dont know if id call it groundbreaking since its a little derivative of toy story and extra guy but this definitely works the scenery and cast are great and the movie bristles with energyi just wish they kept this a little more lighthearted and a little less preachy there are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events but how many great comedies are there these days how about for once just keeping things light and entertaining the patriarchy seriouslyregardless i think most of the audience loved it and i think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the moms big speech its a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power and you will probably be glad you went,0.9946,positive,True
227,fernandoschiavi,22-Jul-23,despite the strong commercial tone it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by greta gerwig and the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director  in addition to margot robbie herself as a producer barbie has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today and the film does it with a big heart the story is genuinely fun with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists reserving touching moments and provoking reflections especially in its final stretch debauchery is the great ally of gerwig and baumbach to deal not only with sexism but also with the corporate issue it wont be strange if you catch yourself thinking how did mattel let this film see the light of day laughing at yourself after all seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itselfin the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the barbie universe the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project in these changes of atmosphere we were able to appreciate the creative photography by rodrigo prieto  who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit  and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices such as costume pieces type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001 a space odyssey here well catch glimpses of the wizard of oz and the truman show well go through the fairytalelike artificiality of jacques demys films for the dance and choreographic performance of gene kelly for the visual and dramatic intensity of the little red shoes and all that jazz its a lot barbie is a well of enriching cinematographic referencesbut leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look in addition to addressing important points of todays society greta gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms barbie into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism the production is very much in line with a famous quentin tarantino interview in 2021 given to bill maher on his hbo broadcast real time in which he said ultimately ideology trumps art individual effort good entertainment unfortunately in this film this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war used as a puppet by political militancy full of language allegories open messages and ideological discourses the film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone to be a comedy and romance epic and it had the quality to do so but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrolthe film has an interesting premise thats undeniable and it flows most of the time but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn since the target audience here is females of all ages this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy criticism of beauty standards the hypocritical discourse against consumerism as if warner mattel artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales from selling new dolls etc manhatred all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots greedy dumb or wanting power for themselves greta gerwigs goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard because the stereotyped barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy  the character sasha played by ariana greenblatt is the one who plays this role like the militant of today always connected and who knows everything about life where gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentionsthe truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate not love barbie here hates men capitalism fun and hates barbie doll herself calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll if youre a woman and you played with her as a kid according to the movie you supported patriarchy barbie cant just be a pretty blonde thin woman either after all that doesnt encompass the mandatory diversity and inclusion in hollywood today to resolve this issue they created a universe in which everyone is barbie we even have a barbie who was born a man yes a trans barbie  who by the way is a doctor the men in barbieland who cares are there to be mistreated and ignored ken is just an accessory when barbie and ken come into the real world everything changes ken discovers patriarchy a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot and likes that world barbie finds unbridled machismo if barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense romance between barbie and ken not at all after all that wouldnt be empowering at all ken even rejects the doll at one pointken represents the evil patriarchy everything in this film becomes one big lecture one big sermon barbie scolding workers who whistle at her police officers harassing barbie at the police station a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue that is victim of the toxic men of the world barbie still has to choose between flipflops and heels showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made follow feminism that is flipflops we also have the passage of the protagonist gloria cheating on her husband a fool by the way and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheatingall male clichs are portrayed here according to the feminist view because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time according to the films script here the barbies were coopted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the kens in a kind of macho dystopia everything ken likes is depicted as toxic evil and terrible stallone godfather horses zack snyder etc barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women women have everything men have nothing mattel executives are all portrayed as white straight men and still calls this type of profile conservative fascist for the director it is never enough to be a woman you have to be a mother a wife work and still receive criticism the unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies and that they cannot study work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work yes because apparently the evil businessmen hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job at the end of the plot glorias feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy kens are beaten because they are dumb the barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective ken jealous with another ken of course after all all men only know how to create wars destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid after all if men are stupid why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film a basic and inexplicable plot hole herebarbie is a great satire but when it touches on feminist issues it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men since women are portrayed as being totally perfect sasha and gloria are the main latin characters here and the barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas obviously the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and of course the popularity of the barbie doll that has been successful for generations in addition to having many merits especially in the technical part the detailed creative and extremely tasteful scenarios especially in barbieland are a spectacle in themselves in addition to the magnificent performances by margot robbie charismatic and incredibly beautiful and ryan gosling hilarious as ever the musicals on the other hand are horrible poorly performed and owing a lot in that regardbarbie talks about choices and changes in the hands of greta gerwig the typical behavior of dolls and dolls via imagination takes on a critical form and points to many paths visiting metalanguage politicalsocial relations patriarchy and feminism feelings including the arrogant and insensitive posture of barbie in front of ken as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend existential crises or acceptance of ones social and gender condition the work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a liveaction barbie that is undeniable the problem is that in the end barbie doesnt even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of selfdiscovery who is barbie the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity,0.9953,positive,True
229,khadafimusaad,12-Aug-23,i like frating movies to know and understand women especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario and of course there is no doubt what makes it grate gerwig although this time there is no saoire ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films this work barbie comes set in barbielands fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman the moving plot of the barbie fantasy world conflict increases when entering the world of reality and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story which is a red herring type of plot what is meant is that the author diverts the audiences minds as in this film barbie has to correct flat soles but it is not the essence of the basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase with an amazing fantasy idea between the difference between the world of reality and the world called barbielandi went straight to the point which was the first time that barbie like women in general felt insecure she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach this is my favorite scene because it reminds me of my childhood when i saw my sister crying because her barbie doll didnt stand up straight i got the meaning from that scene that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places in this film barbie is a womans childhood imagination playing with barbie dolls thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll this adds up to barbies wish to go to the real world to repair the soles of her feet and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character barbie played by margot robbie this is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment in order to eliminate physical deficiencies regardless of the morals contained in her even though she is margot robbie toothe scene between the world of reality and the world of barbie in this case my analogy the world of reality is represented against liberalism and the world of barbie is imagined conservatively this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of barbie by feminism while the opposite of reality there is control of the world of barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner then the scene of an elderly grandmother namely ruth whom barbie first met accidentally sat next to ruth my intuition at this moment seeing the happiness of an old woman whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences thinking that beauty can disappear and thats what barbie feels when she looks back at ruth and also makes barbie aware of her question about death in the musical scene at the beginning of the film  this is where barbies maturity signifies when she returns to barbielandso that at the ending point the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman and the slogan shes everything hes just ken i interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable experience social phenomena that occur want to try new things until they get their point of freedom the purpose of life is understanding everything pride in being a complete woman who is in expressing herself in a complex environment  especially women who live in a patriarchal environment finally barbie realized the meaning of girl mother grandmother and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men in this case kenoverall the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value plus sarcasm scripts that contain in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor regarding production design without a doubt maybe i championed this award was obtained by barbie at the 2024 oscars because from that side it really broke marketing the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches i give barbie 75100,0.9966,positive,True
235,darksun3,3-Sep-23,i saw this film with an open mind i was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way either visually through the actors perhaps a fun story or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with unfortunately it struck out on all accounts the much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast the actors were so clichd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch as you may have heard ryan gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name the movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes in fact it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writerdirectors personal concerns we were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the endmost concerning is that barbie was clearly modeled after the first matrix movie but in all the worst ways barbies world is a binary place composed of barbieland where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call the real world the real world is name of the place they travel to in matrix as well but in barbie its not a dark hellish landscape run by machines instead it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company mattel also the men are all shown to be domineering rude and chauvinistic its clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that its as unrealistic as the one in the matrix a man walking by barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside she then gets arrested for defending herself what while shes being arrested the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more the toy company executives all wear suits like the agents in the matrix and work in unrealistic barren industrial looking cubicles they also drive black suvs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world we get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in the real world and i lost count of the number of times the word patriarchy was used i know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world in the matrix there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in barbie there was mostly sadness in both the movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible the bright colorful happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark depressing and irredeemable if it was meant to reflect our real world well its so far out there that it doesnt even come close if its mean to show a fantasy world the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available it was difficult to complete watching barbie because it tried to say so much that in the end it said nothing at all it was a fantasy film with only an unhappy sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded,-0.9948,negative,True
236,sotsyd,27-Sep-23,i totally get it the themes the message the irony its just i expected way more of an actual story and to come full circle but it just left me feeling oddpositives the film is beautiful and theres many laugh out loud moments both my partner and i did on many occasions i liked the change from barbie land to real life i liked the shock at seeing how much of a mans world we live innegatives i found the endless cameos and useless one liners really odd from will farrells colleagues just popping up for one word to celebrities constantly saying hey barbie bye barbie it just felt so oddthe ending seemed to not really finish the movie for me i expected when the barbies got their homes back theyd then start a new way of life where they share with the kens instead of going straight back to female only or female led spaces isnt that just as oppressive as the misogyny theyre against in the real world so theyve not learnt from the events that have happenedas well as the montage section i really didnt get that bit and im a 33yo femalemaybe i set my expectations too high from all the hype i would actually like to watch the movie again to see if i still feel the same,0.9461,positive,True
241,salexandria_f,9-Aug-23,i went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism but i found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie i interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that todays feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven leader boss bitch to have a meaningful life this movie voices that sometimes women while respecting the women that do dont want to be a leader whos a mom and has the career sometimes we just want to be average and thats ok i also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and gg did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie while i agree that it was annoying how the kens were treated at the beginning of the movie i felt the ending tied it all together overall i enjoyed the movie as humans i think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was i made for and even though this was referring to barbie it can be very relatable,0.9804,positive,True
247,Special-K88,12-Sep-23,viewers are plunged into the sunny candycoated world of barbieland where stereotypical barbie enjoys her idyllic life until shes abruptly struck with an existential crisis with dopey ken as her companion barbie journeys to real world where not to put too fine a point on it things are just irrevocably messed up greta gerwigs glossy sparkly splashy musical satire offers up dazzling visual eye candy with double entendres clever and funny critiques of consumerism femininity mansplaining and the hierarchical system opens with such flash and snap until it veers off and stumbles over itself trying to hammer home its message while searching for a real plot and then reverts into some formulaic battle between the matriarchy and patriarchy with shifting sympathies that actually confuse its themes nonetheless an obsequiously grinning from ear to ear robbie is ideally cast but so is daft superfluous gosling making it hard to deny ,-0.1655,negative,True
251,vincentsheehan,25-Jul-23,"a confused misfiring tedious and pretentious affair i was expecting much better yet ultimately disappointed margot robbie and to a lesser extent ryan gosling is very good but otherwise even she cant save this twaddle dont listen to the critics  it is crappros the opening scene apeing 2001 a space odyssey was funnycons
it needed better editing to create a more coherent structure
it had very dull patches despite the pink
the emphasis on the patriarchy was definitely laid on too thick

255,shl-53673,2-Aug-23,barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with herentering barbieland is breathtaking its built exactly like a childs imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics the first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours the dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where i would create these kinds of scenes with my toys i wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real worldryan gossling stole the show i dont remember the last time i laughed so much it was iconic how gerwig reversed the narrative and made ken into the typical representation of women in film the film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film with references of space odessey the matrix the truman show the wizard of oz and hundreds of others it made the film have that much more depthi feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit the quests barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me it offers comic relief but i believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how barbies saved us the mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative other than having 0 personality or depth we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives they could have been better written or removed all together the monologue sequence was a mistake show me how women live in this world instead of telling me it sounded too preachy for me despite me being a feminist if we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter and more on giving concrete examples of womens pressure it would have been a stronger filmthe story and characterization is also lacking at mattel we never get a conclusion to why mattel went back to barbieland the story felt incomplete and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers this brings me to argue that we didnt receive the movie that was intended by the director although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women it could have been pushed even further perhaps the large presence of corporate players like mattel and chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire i was expecting a kubrick kind of satire and as much as we did get some of that more subtle satire could have been beneficial i have full confidence in gerwigs skills which is why id be curious to see a directors cut lets petition for itthe ending was also disappointing for me i felt like i was watching harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 for no apparent reason perhaps they didnt really know where to go with the story and im shocked they chose that i liked that we got to meet the creator of barbie but there was something missing for me overall this was a fun time i think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes i look forward to watching it again in the future,0.9852,positive,True
259,Vintagefan55,3-Aug-23,i think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales it certainly isnt the movie itself the storyline was overly simplistic poorly written and i didnt find its style of absurd humor to be funny the movie relied a lot on sight gags that i thought fell flat the ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity margot robbie is the consummate barbie but she pretty much plays actress barbie in everything she does so it wasnt anything groundbreaking for her i thought gloria and sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason i gave the movie any stars at all the concept of patriarchy certainly isnt anything new and imo there are much better films on the subject  starting with any of the jane austin films and this directors other film  little women,0.9761,positive,True

be age i knew that it couldnt be a bad movie since it has a very good director luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story it is a criticism using humor about feminism machismo patriarchy about what women face i had never thought that barbie was nominated by women however her mistake was wanting perfectionism about existential doubts the world dominated by men on many occasions the relationships of mothers and adolescents the daily routine trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate i think it is a film that being well analyzed has very good components and a very good plot something that one never imagined from a movie about barbie",0.989,positive,True

303,sezahp,26-Jul-23,when i watched the trailer for the first time i wasnt sure if i would want to watch the movie but all the great marketing and internet hype made me excited so i watched it and i couldnt be happier i have to say that at least every girl should watch this moviethe representation of girls in a mans world and the difference between a fantasy and the reality are shown greatly but apart from that the movie and the script just carry such a powerful message towards women that should be heard when i went out of the cinema i felt so empowered and selfconfidentkudos to greta gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for womenanother important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it margot robbie played her role so well i was actually convinced she was barbie and ryan gosling had the absolute best facial expressions i enjoyed watching them sooo much worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses they were all amazing whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise everybody managed to portray their characters so wellone of my favorite scenes was the fight between the kens because of how realistic the actors played itand the costumes and decorationshouses should also be acknowledged i watched the dreamhouse tour on youtube and i appreciated all the detail so much barbies cowboy costume was the banger i think that was my favourite fit from the entire movieand the music im just ken is still stuck in my head and whenever it comes on shuffle i scream to it dramatically  but its not only this song i keep listening to the barbie album on spotify because all the songs are so catchyi really want to rewatch this movie its a solid 1010 from me  im a girl btw if you couldnt tell xd,0.9958,positive,True
310,arungeorge13,13-Sep-23,my onlyever memory of a barbie doll was the one my cousin sister once owned and i secretly sabotaged owing to some temporary argument in our childhood i do remember that it was a stereotypical version with blonde hair and a pink or some shade of it dress i made that oncegoodlooking doll into crazy barbie by drawing weird shapes on her face pulling some of her hair out and twisting at least one of her plastic limbs i also remember hiding away some of the crockery tea cups and the like shortly after well this film brought back that repressed memory which i dont think i apologized to her for of course i did so afterwards and thats how rewarding the movie felt for methe first act of barbie was deliberately plastic as if gerwig was trying to reinforce the idea of how a perfectly feminine world exists the hi barbies were starting to get a bit annoying and the unabashed celebration of every night being girls night and women basically holding all decisionmaking power came across as gerwing trying to impose the blunt idea that if women are involved in everything the world automatically becomes a better place  no questions asked when you perceive this through a mans lens its actually pretty brilliant this is exactly what women must feel at least frequently when they see us celebrating masculinity even to toxic levels robbie is the perfect choice to portray stereotypical barbie and thats purely because she can make us feel for the characters existential crisis just as much as we can adore her looksthe films binding strength however is ryan goslings ken as the film progressed it almost felt like if this were a movie about barbie questioning her existence and just fighting mattels idea of corporate villainy that wouldve been clichd kens presence adds an intriguing layer  when he and barbie make it to the real world and concludes that men rule the real world he becomes the antithesis he gathers all kens in barbieland and makes them acknowledge patriarchy at this point as much as i was entertained by kens antics barbies realizations and the wonderful production design costumes and soundtrack i wasnt sure how gerwig would tackle the final act the first two acts came across as both sides being somewhat toxic what with the sidelining of the opposite gender for no apparent reasonbut the final act is a masterstroke other than gerwigs decision not to fully antagonize the corporate that manufactures barbie dolls and their excessive product placements because well they coproduced it the writing is brilliant the fact that they allowed gerwig to go this far itself is refreshing it acknowledges errors on both ends and understands how a balance is entirely significant it asks ken to stand on his own two feet without having barbie by his side always it also pays tribute to barbies creator for all her faults including tax evasion adding a couple of conversational scenes featuring her and margots barbie that gives the latter some level of character closure this is how you make a film based on a toy and give it the depth it wholly deserves shine on greta ,0.9595,positive,True
312,gregorydickens-99515,22-Jul-23,this film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set costume and prop designs however the film shoves its agendas down our throats like its thanksgiving dinnerthe marketing team played it off as just a fun harmless selfaware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism mockery of the entire male species outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experiencethe movie contrasts barbieland as femaledominatedcontrolling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something likewise in the real world men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff the film shows half the human population the men as utterly and irredeemably horribleand by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team nope the kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the barbies go back to their girlpower or ruling everything without thinking twice about it it feels like they almost had a good ending but simply just couldnt help themselvesin front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking is it almost over multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene do not take your little girls to this one truly a wolf in sheeps clothing using a kids toy as a trojan horse for feminist messaging is just ridiculous,0.99,positive,True
318,allipthomas,21-Jul-23,this movie is everything and more its comedic colorful entertaining heartfelt nostalgic and has such a truly meaningful message thats fit for everyonewhile the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy its a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone not just women where ryan goslings ken was struggling to find who he really is because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity theres also the more obvious example of the barbies being brainwashed into servitudeas marvelously played by margot robbie barbie feels the struggles that many women face  where we feel lost at some point in our lives america ferreras monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary this movie positively shows the beauty of womanhoodbarbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come,0.9783,positive,True
320,gianmarcocibella,21-Jul-23,its hard to say this movie isnt great even if you dont agree with the third act feminism part i mean margot robbie nailed it and ryan gosling come on i was expecting so much from him and he was even better than i tought so freaking funny and always on point the set production and costume design are of course oscar nominees alreadyoverall i liked the message the social critic the perfomances the production the jokes were very funny the references whats there not to like such an enjoyable movie perhaps the part played by america ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way but that doesnt ruin the movie at all i think its a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well,0.9642,positive,True
325,brjwalker,24-Aug-23,the 1968 picture planet of the apes reverses traditional roles after timetravelling thousands of years into the future astronaut charlton heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate and humans their chattelsi hated the movie as a boy in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film could it happen i wondered where humans could become inferior to another species if it did would we deserve it the film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure i have never dared rewatch itthe 2023 movie barbie looks nothing like planet of the apes its cinematography is an exercise in highoctane kitsch as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell yet it too explores role reversal here between sexes rather than speciesbarbieland is a quasimirror image of realworld the films moniker for presentday california barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy the barbies for they are multiple live happy fulfilled lives they prosper at the top of every profession and public office they never age bodily imperfections are impossible and life is a perpetual merrygoround of choreographed parties infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood the men  the kens  are decoration they are unable to perform even basic functions physical and sexual they lack genitals their muscles are impressive but purely for show they preen on the beach but surfing is beyond themone day classic barbie margot robbie awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her highheeled shoes she no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes but on flat ordinary soles to the collective horror of her sisterhoodrobbie realises something is wrong and  following a revelation from her compatriot weird barbie  sets out to realworld to resolve it classic ken ryan gosling stows away in her car the duo eventually arrive in santa monica via a series of rosetinted vehiclesit isnt long before gosling discovers that realworld is unlike barbieworld here the power is held by men gosling surprised to be treated with respect becomes fascinated with patriarchy and quickly warms to the paradigm for robbie the experience is the opposite people mock her daily life is threatening not fun her selfconfidence warps into selfconsciousness ken precedes her return to barbieland and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into kendom a toyish grotesque of realworld where the kens are in charge and the barbies retained as ornamental servantsmuch ensues we race and chase suvs with the motheranddaughter pair who own robbies doll in realworld theres an overlong musical sequence in which gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in la la land mattels allmale csuite led by the onedimensional will ferrell provide limited laughs and add little to the plot beyond an admirable modicum of selfawareness products are placed  even chanel  with abandon still we are being entertained and mostly engagedthe final act sees barbie and friends manipulate the kens and prevail there are no suffragers in barbieland and following a unanimous referendum of an allfemale electorate the natural order of things is restored a dark compelling twist looks imminent but it never arrivesrather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative director greta gerwig retreats from it instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into welltrodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism i die therefore i amrobbies barbie eventually opts not to live in barbieworld but as a real imperfect woman in los angeles this is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary barbieworld might itself become but because she likes the idea of being human how do the remaining barbies perceive their homeland do they support gynocracy are they comfortable with the kens being sidelined the passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that for the first 85 minutes hammers home its message relentlessly and preciselythe narrator helen mirren assures us that one day the kens might enjoy the same status in barbieworld that women do in realworld it is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised given the kens are gainlessly employed politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary barbie and ken experience equality in neither barbieworld nor realworld in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other perhaps barbie ultimately prefers la because despite its manifold flaws it at least has no pretence to being a utopiain planet of the apes we discover in the final reel that hestons destination is not a dystopian otherworld but earth itself through nuclear war mans hatred greed and hubris has caused his own downfall the oppressor has become the oppressed perhaps man deserves it in barbie gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion instead she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of hollywood and mattel,0.0108,neutral,True
326,bbreee,17-Aug-23,was just okay the acting is super ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think and margot is a perfect barbie she ate her role up this is not a kids movie has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting most of the humour lands for me honestly i thought it was cute the diolouge isnt best but its a movie about barbie what were any of us really expectingit was kinda confusing towards the end the begininng was really fun maybe a little bit annoying but thats just me like i said not my type of film the colors were great the barbieland set was cute after they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me i thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up and everythings fine they tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way it seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene i feel the feminist point of the film wouldve come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then boom big monolouge it was just a lot but empty at the same timeand i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think like point proven all women have had that happen to them it was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfyand nothing was ever really resolved in the real world besides the mom and daughter with barbie and then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel first female ceo feminism but no shes just going to the gynocologist yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didnt take itoverall much different than expected this dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for thought it was going to be lightheartedso idk it was cute i may be too hard on it cause i enjoy movies that make you think and have deeper elements all the elements here were blatently there also im saying all this as a young adult female i know i was one of the target audiences for this,0.9945,positive,True

334,mainstreet-62539,28-Aug-23,clever funny charming with bright bold colors and visually stunning but that is what i heard going into the film and i was not disappointed in any way in that area the sets are also amazing and the barbie worlds they created vs the fake real world sets that they made really coolthe only part that got old fast was the preachiness of the writing i got it the first 50 times you made it clear about feminism and that women should run everything and be everything that is fine but any filmmaker that keeps repeating their point or theme too much risks boring the audience by overstating or over playing your message many mainstream  indies have made this mistake really likeable cast and set designs even the music was funny  clever so a lot of good overall,0.9796,positive,True
335,FlixFLos,30-Jul-23,first half was very enjoyable but the rest felt rushed and with no direction like it didnt really know what to focus oni loved the music and choreography the scenography was amazing and i genuinely laughed a couple timesken bringing patriarchy to barbieland and screwing things up is a fun and interesting concept although i feel like the plot turned simplistic and took the easy way out i dont buy the nah everything was perfect before lets get things exactly as they werethe dialogues sometimes want to be this emotional speeches that kinda take me out it doesnt feel like a natural progression as it is often said it was too much tell and too little show,0.9887,positive,True
336,emiliepoulain,11-Aug-23,i really enjoyed the movie but it also tore me to pieces i saw myself reflected in many very difficult situations in my life as a woman beyond the fact that my feminism allows me to be aware of many things i got home thinking a lotmargot robbies performance is incredible it really makes you feel all the sadness despair and finally the relief of being a real and imperfect woman ken was also very good i feel that gosling is going to win an oscarseparate point for the costumes scenarios makeup excellently done barbie is undoubtedly the movie of the year 2023 in short watch it its a great movie thank you thank you thank you,0.9789,positive,True
338,dspornakk,22-Jul-23,i absolutely loved it margot robbie is the perfect stereotypical barbie ryan gosling gives an oscarworthy performance and has a true rock n roll voice the soundtrack is also very very good subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references michael cera is funnily adorable barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining greta gerwig and noah baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion barbie was brilliantly cast i loved ryan gosling hes terrific as ken and delivers an oscarworthy performance the ending is good and its worth sticking around to watch the credits,0.9934,positive,True
339,adibshahriar,23-Jul-23,at the interval i was surprised of how much i was enjoying barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism the overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age but it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up ryan gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times margot robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film but i expected more from barbie and greta gerwig didnt satisfy me she should have tried for a different sort of ending,0.9615,positive,True

men about feminism patriarchy consumerism and existentialism in its own weird sometimes cringe but mostly funny wayfull marks for casting top to toe perfect casting for barbie and ken but movi is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwisetotally skippable in the theatres its not worth the hype tbh",0.7711,positive,True
344,avemerillo,23-Jul-23,started well had some great moments and acting was goodhowever the point of turning kenland back to barbielandwhat was supposed to convey that barbies aka women actually want to live looking like barbies in their almost identical barbiehouses that its women against men and men their dreams are stupidi found the mattel team going to barbieland totally out of context and it didnt add anything either to idea or humor of the movie men leading the patriarchy in real world were made to look silly and idiotic which didnt add anything to the ideas but felt embarrassing rather than funnyi found the movie weird confusing and not empowering at all,-0.3919,negative,True
345,dvlbr,23-Jul-23,what a cinematic experience the mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination i dont know where to start i feel like greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in hollywood this film is iconic using the character and icon of barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do throughout the film i was always connecting it to disneys soul due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message barbie experiencing the real life for the first time life is unique a beautiful gift that its worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering  using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics patriarchy feminism life as a woman in all its aspects all in a really enjoyable beautifully crafted comedic way barbie and the married writers manages to unite different kinds of genres musical  ryan gosling is sublime in musicals you know what i mean  bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer in a special way this movie is near to perfection the epilogue really adds to that perfection with a heartwrenching soundtrack by billie eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by margot robbie its her year and she deserves all of it to summarise the film i am kenough,0.997,positive,True
346,qrawbr,26-Jul-23,im only saying it could have been better because of the hype i was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film firstly ill say that margot as barbie and ryan as ken were great individually a large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen i found watching ken discovering patriarchy to be the most hilarious part of the film however one of the first critiques i have is that it felt like the movie didnt spend enough time in barbieland the serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the perfect life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and kens this also would have made me personally feel more like i care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that barbie and ken were experiencing when they went to the real world secondly its use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about i think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate i understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone and it was however it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used it just felt in my personal opinion to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message finally which brings me to my third critique is that the movie didnt seem to be for kids but at the same time it was my first argument for why perhaps the two critiques i have made might not be valid is because its a kids film and in that sense it would well make sense but then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldnt be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children dont get me wrong i love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at which i argue shrek did very well for example however the script of this movie im not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points i madenevertheless it was an enjoyable film and good in its own merits ken as a character made a lot of sense given his whole purpose as a doll in real life and that essence i think they captured well 710,0.9816,positive,True
351,brendan-63701,8-Sep-23,barbie opens with an homage to 2001 a space odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning artificial reality of barbieland where the sky is a painting and the food imagined its colorful the set designers display fully realized artistic visionsits nice to see a movie that isnt over sanitized for a mass audience a movie that doesnt play it safe you can see the influences greta gerwig wanted to include from old hollywood all over the place margot robbie is the star as barbie fully embodying the perfect barbie life until cracks start to form in barbielandbarbie presents two dystopian worlds one a bad version of the real world and barbieland where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power it was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class ken is essential to the emotional core of the film hes how we see the injustice of barbieland the movie isnt manhating it uses the poor treatment of the kens by the barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are significant spoilers after this pointthe movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from gloria thanks to america ferreras excellent performance that we dont have to be perfect we can embrace being ordinary she doesnt want the perfect barbie life either she wants an ordinary barbie thats also a mom loves her family and embraces her imperfections as good things the concern with insecurity caused by barbie is made less tactfully by glorias daughter who goes on a screed calling barbie a fascist you cant tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at gen z self righteousnessrobbies stereotypical barbie also learns these values shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of barbieland this is why its so important she leaves barbieland at the end of the film she rejects the reimposed female domination of barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in barbieland barbieland is not the good placethere were some significant negatives for me though i thought the movie had some humor that fell very flat in parts the scenes at mattel didnt do much for me the movie was at its weakest in the real world where we spent a lot of time some of the characters had rushed developmenti am kenough,0.9752,positive,True

353,barbett-1,8-Aug-23,barbie is a fun little movie that is at its core a satire on traditional gender roles in society thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom if ever lives up to our youthful expectations some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive antimale agenda but i cant see it that way its simply a movie based on a toy that dares to actually not take itself seriously look at other films in this genre such as battleship gi joe and the transformers films all take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark realism barbie doesnt do that it reveals that its a joke in the very first sceneis this a great movie absolutely not but it is fun entertaining summertime fluff margo robbie and ryan gosling both look and act perfectly plastic the set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace see it and enjoy,0.9893,positive,True
357,ghoshi-kol,23-Jul-23,the real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this friday one was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema the former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a mans world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics to address the elephant in the room oppenheimer beats barbie on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight irrespective of what the box office figures might denotethat said barbie is a good film a fun watch that could have been so much more the first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime it was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant colourful world without any trace of morbidity the barbie houses the beach the house of the weird barbie the roads the netherlandslike fields the sea  they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that gerwigs vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow to conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our barbies the barbies come from all walks of life hold important positions and stay at the frontline of barbie life  a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash at the center of all these barbies is margot robbies stereotypical barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety she is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned hence the stereotype about her the kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities all was well until the real world began messing with the barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner barbie should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in the last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done ken song  one of my favourite moments from the film gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision for the world she has accomplished in this film for the infinite ideas she has established  feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes she has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression if only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much betterbarbie packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy sadness existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed issa rae as president barbie and kate mckinnon as weird barbie are two other standouts but the real star of the show is ryan gosling  his kenergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout just look at his incredible comedic chops when ken visits the human world you just cant have kenough of goslings ken la la land showed that he could dance really well a skill he has put effectively to use in the ken song tooin the end gerwigs film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena it could have had a little more of the muchness as the mad hatter would say in alice in wonderland in the fun department it dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavyhandedness drags it down to an extent alas,0.9952,positive,True

375,alarsen-80769,22-Jul-23,wow this was really bad here is the truth its boring plus who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs yes the word patriarchy is said like 100 times its crazy this was so heavy handed i dont even get why woman would like itithis should be fun not some political statement let me tell you the only fun was in the first 30 mins nobody and i mean nobody was laughing the plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer which has done some great work in the past just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense i thought barbie would just be a fun goofy movie but to be preached for 2 hours what the hell im telling you most people will not like this movie unless youre far far left,-0.2431,negative,True
377,olgakastritsi-81359,22-Jul-23,firstly ill say that im the movies target audience a female in her 20s even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies which i 100 agree with and the right to choose what you want to be in your life it felt uncomfortable it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated in the world of barbie all kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes i wont give spoilers but in this perfect barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only barbie but the ken dolls are also doctors scientists politicians etc etcmargot robbie and ryan gosling went above and beyond i enjoyed their performances some scenes were also very funny but personally i did not like the ending,0.9386,positive,True
378,wirsingleon,31-Jul-23,"margot robbie is perfect as barbie
john cena and america ferrera deliver hilarious performances
the movie tackles feminism and patriarchy in a funny and unsubtle waybarbie movie is an inventive comedy that works both as a love letter and deconstruction of barbie as a concept
the movie is fun creative and goes in unexpected directions
it has clever messages about manhood and redemption
kens character is redeemed and barbie apologizes to him for ignoring him before
the movie portrays how isolating manhood can be and ends with the kens finding fulfillment in being their own people
the song im just ken is catchy and perfectly integrated into the final battlebarbie is a movie that explores the struggles and joy of womanhood

the movie is extremely funny welldirected and has wonderful sets and costumes",0.9887,positive,True
382,KFstudios2009,3-Sep-23,barbenheimer who is the winner actually when i thought about it their are two completely different movies both of them are great i will tell you why this movie is great but the main point is that you cant just compare this two movies anyway greta gerwig did an absolutely amazing job and i was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was this is not made for kids even if you could think this would be for kids but no some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand the good things about barbie is the valuable moral itself they show you that the world and humanity isnt perfect and it is never going to be perfect you just have to focus on how you are now they showed how women were treated in centuries and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women strong reckless and to never show their feelings that is something i wouldnt expect from this movie i was very surprised and the representation of men ken just ken as the main ken played be ryan gosling he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour margot robbie was the second big star or the first both of them were amazing but she played with such a feeling and emotion when barbie the main barbie played by margot discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect and that not everyone are like her she was completely off margot robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in besides the actors the storytelling scenography and music soundtrack was amazing sometimes it was a bit too much screaming but thats not the point this movie was awesome this is a movie for everyone if you like barbie this movie is for you if you dont like barbie this movie is for you this is a movie made for everyone everyone can enjoy it and i cant really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden this movie offers you so much moral entertainment and i think this was a great movie,0.9968,positive,True
385,marianacastro-54554,23-Jul-23,i enjoyed the creation of the barbie world the costumes set design and i think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant the script however was not that solidthey were going for a direct transparent explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue but it often had a hard time landing particularly at the beginning some things felt spoonfed to the audience as if they werent going to understand the givens of ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in barbie land we visually understand it but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessarythe pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times you also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles even though margot roby and ryan gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch youre following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world but it was exactly the most profound which is fiiiine its a movie about a doll afterall but if they were going for this pov they shouldve dug deeper in my opinioni love all the actors involved and the work of greta gerwig and the work of noah baumbach but this wasnt their best worki would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion you can still enjoy the world the acting and have a laugh here and there also for people who have never taken a look at our binary sexist and patriarchal society it could be eye opening for my part i often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others particularly women so i wanted more out of the argument of the movie deeper,0.9666,positive,True
390,bojanasormaz,20-Jul-23,i expected a funny easygoing movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone i was amazed by the depth of the story feminism done right without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases a must see if youre capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world  wasnt sure about ryan gosling as ken the match seemed off but after seeing the movie i think he did great helen mirren is the narrator which is also amazing beautiful story abour equality feminism finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world,0.9814,positive,True
392,greasefreak,21-Jul-23,this movie was fantastic leave it to the writers greta and noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well the details on the set were outstanding it even addresses some of how barbie was created being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant momenti will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater know your director this was not a film created to advertise for barbie this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for oscars they know what they want to say and why the target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie but dont let this deter you theres enough music humor and and character development for barbie and ken to keep the audience entertained even if its over their head,0.946,positive,True
396,Westmoney,23-Jul-23,so bad its good what a politicalphilosophicalartisticstylisticlinguisticdirectoralmusical mess who is this film even for im guessing teenage airheads  the sort that happily equate a barbie doll with the nazi war machine as is done in the film wow if the aim was feminism id call this an own goal so whinging so reliant on gender stereotypes and societal stereotypes so busy sermonising it achieves nothing the reasoning behind the films reasoning wouldnt stand up to two minutes of scrutiny who wrote this junk who directed it who signed it off honestly im not kidding when i say its so bad its good id happily rewatch it just to marvel again at the grinding cognitive dissonance im looking forward to the imdb rating dropping  already below 75,0.858,positive,True
397,giot_lol,21-Aug-23,its impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a wellknown brandthe movie addressed a range of great themes skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytalelike presentationone of the key messages is when barbie talks to ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship exploring personal preferences and selfawareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership developing a strong selfrelationship is a foundational step before building connections with othersthe movie also transforms the traditional barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while barbies serve them this shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchya particularly touching moment is barbie creators monologue it resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of selfconfidence and fear of taking control of their livesthe film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models leading to personal dissatisfaction barbie has beenstill is an example of those models however if our real lives start being reflected into the doll we will notice how miserable and depressing we all areits sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages,-0.6124,negative,True
399,leeyagam,21-Jul-23,"this movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman and the grief we might feel growing up as one i was so incredibly touchedmargos acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for barbieas well as ryan perfect castingi genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around methis movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen not only as the girl boss and other outdated feminist catchphrases but also as the depth we have and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasnt as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy
the thing with these type of movies is that a womans perspective and a mans perspective are completely different most women i know that watched the movie felt as i did  love grief touched and understoodthe men that have watched the movie did love it as well and some hated it because of toxic masculinity but most of them werent touched and i think that made me a little heartbroken
other than that  its truly is a feminist masterpiecei will definitely will be watching again",0.6106,positive,True
406,lstuart_berry,22-Jul-23,i was all in for this movie before i saw it as time went by i got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and id inevitably be disappointed saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink yes the men too i laughed far more than i expected and had a damn good cry my ridiculous expectations were exceededbarbie is funnier and more touching than i was expecting its just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way im not sure how i left a film after staring at margo robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before i went in see it in the cinema if you can going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful fill two hours of your time with joy and kenergy we are all kenough,0.903,positive,True
408,mmyilmazyurt,28-Sep-23,i certainly didnt expected this film to be what it isgrowing up realizing the world around you yourself anxiety depression responsibilities relationships and more but it resonated with me mostly from kens povto love or caring someone while ignoring your own identity and needs try to please with your every second leaves you empty and its not fair for anyone on either sidethis film isnt just about feminism or female empowerment its about growing up and finding who you really are and what is your actual purpose which is the hardest thing for anyone including myselfthank you greta gerwig and the crew,0.7357,positive,True
411,jayceenhoward,21-Jul-23,walking into the theater i was expecting a silly outrageous fun contrast to the competing new release of oppenheimer but instead i found much more not only did this movie have incredible humor but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman the light it brought to the deep connection to mothers and daughtersespecially the moment shared between margot robbie and ruth handler was nothing short of a tearjerker not only that but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls i have seen some critics who hate magic fun and women be quick to hate on the heavy speech america ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet sure it didnt fit the theme of barbielands perfect pink atmosphere but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater i was ini left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel it spoke to me in ways that cheesy relatable lazily anticapitalist and cheap feminist media could never do this movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself i felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it i went through the hassle of making a damn imdb account and writing an essay that wasnt required by a teacher or school project i actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving kens of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie it is beautiful and a must watch,0.9945,positive,True
416,ojford,22-Aug-23,the first half is excellent it starts with a 2001 dawn of man parody with robbie as the original striped barbie in place of the monolith then shows us barbieland barbie is overrun with morbid thoughts so travels to the real world with a stowaway kenat this point it starts to lose its way  it gets bogged down in preaching against patriarchy  a word used so many times you could sip lowalcohol beer every time they say the word and be unconscious by the endcharacters give long monologues on how its literally impossible to be a woman and the barbies turn the kens against each other bizarrely by using their sex appeal to evoke jealousy is that really a feminist messagewhatever they were trying to say here it doesnt come across well its preachy onthenose and too unbelievable to communicate a real message other films like gone girl with its cool girl monologue or comedies like bad moms make the point this movie seems to be trying to make much more effectivelybarbieland looks amazing and the first sections there are fun the whole patriarchy messaging was wisely cut out of the trailers it would have been better to make this a fool triumphant story like legally blonde where stereotypical barbie as robbies barbie is known is seen as an airheaded bimbo in the real world yet proves herself,0.9676,positive,True
417,lauravoliver,22-Jul-23,you dont know what to expect before watching barbie and i can assure you it met my expectations and exceeded themi really recommend you watching it such a great work behind and such a great movie it touches topics among feminism the patriarchy and how hard and difficult its to be a womanthe actors did amazing and greta did such a great job with this movie its what we all need and wantedalso shoutout to the music from the movie and the amazing songs that the artists have created for it i totally recommended it i watched it some days ago and cant wait to go watch it again,0.9783,positive,True
425,nsbsnvp,20-Jul-23,i watched this over the weekend and i can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful this is a darkgritty wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon themes of feminism social roles corporate greed aging legacies and divine intervention it reads like a piece from epic poetry as if the gods themselves had come down and made it this is definitely the movie of 2023 and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing i had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and i loved margot robbies take on barbie loved this movie,0.979,positive,True
426,pakeeyaraj,14-Aug-23,barbie is not just a stereotypical hollywood film to celebrate the wellknown brand but it dives in deeper into more self existence gender equality and journey of life the messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all barring the mattel company staff scenes and characters that doest not land they are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film  the third act feels overbloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start the actors  robbie gosling  ferrera are standouts,0.9052,positive,True
429,av1rup,24-Jul-23,"things i didnt like
the over the board marketing and publicity esp about the ip products
lack of subtletyfeels too preachy at some pointsthe mattel scenes were little too sillylike
satire hits hard most of the timeunapologetic and audacious approacha strong message and way it is deliveredthe motherdaughter dynamics at most timesproduction design and color palletsmargot robbie and our guy ryan almost perfectly playing their partsgreta gerwigs directionnow onto some spoilery biti think most people just want to gets triggered without putting much thought behind this they missed the main pointwe have to remember that it is a satire and both the barbie land and real world are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need i think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more importantalso i support how at the end how they didnt just give the kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment in that fictional world the barbies were more qualified by design to hold those positions and all the kens have just been are side characters with no real talents other than being the eye candys to the barbies upliftment on basis of gender and not merittalent is never a sign of a healthy society  but from now onwards it will not be barbieand ken but its barbie and its ken i think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world355  05 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale it will be a 3rd4th in my list of greta gerwigs work",0.8143,positive,True
432,willphelan,11-Nov-23,margot robbie is the best possible choice to play barbie and ryan gosling is terrific as ken its a very interesting story and not one i would automatically expect from a barbie movie but i love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles it shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have female in barbie land and male in the real world and we see why its important to try and understand everyones perspective i also love how this movie dives into mens mental health with kens arc its something that gets overlooked in society and i adore how we got to see ken learn to come to terms with who he is without barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself the movie gives a great arc to barbie as she tries to understand her purpose she realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isnt what she wants anymore there are so many beautiful scenes where barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human at first she starts off thinking that shes a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to she becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real its a great story and greta gerwig did a brilliant job directing the set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful the movie is also very funny and the details and references to barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie the music is incredible there are so many songs in here that are great but ryan goslings performance of im just ken and billie eilishs what was i made for are my favorites they do a great job representing the themes of the movie if i had some complaints i think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall barbie is a success 810,0.9987,positive,True
433,colemanrichards,27-Aug-23,in spite of the crying child in the movie theater i thoroughly enjoyed this film i did not know what to expect going in i was pleasantly surprised and found myself giggling at each unexpected turn of the story it was hilarious watching ken become infatuated with the patriarchy and then quickly shifting to find barbie coming to terms with the pains of reality kept me on my toes and these two competing outlooks found a beautiful synthesis at the end funny heartwarming i learned more about barbie than i ever thought i would i didnt even know about all the different outfits you could buy for your barbie and i am now aware of the existence of mattel hopefully whoever runs their company is doing a better job than will ferrell,0.9595,positive,True
437,hobbsdavidwork,6-Aug-23,a movie that delivered a great few laughs with gosling taking the show margot was fantastic really showcasing her talent as an actor however for the main character of the show it did not seem that way  ken took most of the limelight rightfully so with ryan playing a stellar partthe story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy while granted in this day and age theres a limit to the level of guff one can takea colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be probably not a good idea to bring young kids as the premise and message will go over their heads,0.9261,positive,True
438,justpronouncedkiiddo,23-Jul-23,"i saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience however ive needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that i wasnt sure how to feel about first ken the character himself was hilarious and ryan gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice i loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking like the guy just wanted to learn about horses but pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere so ken being naive just falls into it as well as the societal expectation of needing to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent leading into incel ideologythe thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end after he became his normal self it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again like i still dont wanna be rooting for this guy seeing peoples response to him as a character after the movie had me confused i understand ryan gosling is so fine but ken is not your babygirl he still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologizedthe plot with the realworld mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me it was funny dont get me wrong but it just kind of happened and i wasnt sure what to glean from it at one point i found myself thinking like what happened to those guys and then they just kinda showed up at the end i also know it was meant to be commentary on mattels predominantly male leadership but like you are mattel you have a male ceo like thanks for addressing it but you have no room to talki think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point couldve been used to touch a bit more on body image issues because that is a huge criticism of the barbie brand like okay you had one token fat barbie with an otherwise entirely straightsized cast but some of the jokes were just like pregnant people are weird  and they never entirely said hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens
i think they tried to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across i think it couldve been pretty easy to incorporate a scene like when barbie tried tea for the first time to be like wow indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral valuedespite my criticisms i would say this movie is a mustwatch the points it makes are really important and i actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe which is rare for me with these types of filmsmore of a 7510 than a 7 if i had to say",0.9978,positive,True
440,thedarkhorizon,26-Aug-23,i found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic satire story telling again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity by the end i was moved to tears for barbie and ken it represented to me many issues of modern times and things i was confronted with in real life the candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer i found the barbieworld of course mesmerizing melancholic and so well done i hope apart from all the social media hype it will do some good in the world heals girls women boys and men and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth it is and was the hardest lesson to learn for me,0.9524,positive,True
441,livioborio,23-Jul-23,the films marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers had i not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film i would have been taken aback expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventureinstead barbie turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society while the central idea is commendable the execution fell somewhat short for me the plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed and i could foresee the unfolding events and the movies conclusionundoubtedly the movies core message is strong but i couldnt fully embrace its realization i agree with the critics observations regarding the onedimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending despite the intentionsstill barbie has several strengths the visual style is captivating and the beauty of barbieland is truly enchanting in addition the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characterson the downside some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior which detracts from the overall balance also the treatment of the kens raised some concerns and left room for improvementin conclusion barbie tackles an important and relevant issue but it could have been executed more effectively despite its shortcomings the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances,0.9935,positive,True
445,gentlemansierra-80857,2-Aug-23,okay so im a 30 year old woman feminist and cinephile i left the theater feeling both confused and a bit disappointed i really wanted to like this film its about damn time we have more female directors topping the box office and i gotta say the costume and set design of this film was incredible but the entire plot of the story was all over the place leaving me feeling little to no empathy for the characters albeit ken now ryan gosling made this movie though at times i wasnt sure if he was supposed to be the antagonist or puppy dog we were supposed to sympathize with what really got to me about this movie were the stereotypes which just contradicted the entire message scenes that were meant to be moving fell flat characters had very little development there was no real conflict or climax the end was funny but switched the mood entirely too soon and hey i actually love the godfather i still love it more than barbie and im a chickso there ya go,0.7391,positive,True
451,mssingdveloper,13-Sep-23,i found this film to be disappointing and and an overall letdown to say the leastthe humour acting soundtrack casting  costumes were amazing dont get me started on the dance choreography and the sets i found that those aspects really created an amazing atmosphere for what the perfect barbie world is was intended to be michael cera was absolutely hilarious and i couldnt stop laughing at the broken barbie played by kate mckinnonnevertheless although it was clear they were trying to exaggerate the message on purpose i found the plot to be just stupid barbie fights the patriarchy or ken on a horse i found the humour during multiple points in the movie to be dry especially stressing how much ken loves horsesthe ending i found to be mushy i was expecting something better and just kind of felt let down almost like it was lazyin conclusion id give this movie a solid six out of ten its kind of sad as i am the targeted audience for this film a young feminist progressive woman dont get me wrong this movie was great at parts but in the end was definitely overhyped,0.9397,positive,True
453,itsericag,25-Jul-23,it was a literal cinematic master piece it was comedic touching educational ground breakingit touches upon feminism misogyny patriarchy womens relationship with themselvesit showed a utopia run by women barbie land wasnt perfect the kens were ignored but not hated undervalued but not sexualizedin a world meant to mirror patriarchy we saw a difference in treatment that really opened peoples eyesit also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of timethe hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as hate when it couldnt be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the mostthe best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh cry and wake up mentally togetheroverall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a better world not just for women but for men as wellthis film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society fantastic film,0.9781,positive,True
455,venompool-68826,26-Jul-23,at the beginning it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal but not merely as a reversal both gender groups retain their essence and the ending isnt about one groups victory over the other but about working together it encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself its not about feminism patriarchy or gender confrontation its not about stereotypes or perfectionism its about gender equality embracing individuality and mutual understanding this movie isnt exclusively for women it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou middle school syndrome in both genders outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichs,0.9408,positive,True

458,kimberlyconner-30872,26-Jul-23,the barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable the costumes and sets were great and added to the barbie nostalgia ken was probably my favorite part watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love and finally finding himself outside of barbie at the end of the movie i even enjoyed the overthetop portrayal of the patriarchy it was hilarious however i felt the ending fell flat maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse but i felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the kens to the point that it didnt feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all it felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the kens and laughing it off as funny sure they gave them some minor administrative role at the end but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong like it ended with the barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth it happened as part of the finale the final focus of the film overall i highly enjoyed the movie but the ending really made me leave feeling let down,0.9882,positive,True
462,nenasarec,22-Jul-23,the production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful same goes to the most of the cast with beautiful attention to detial uncluding actual cars and houses that we played withbut the message of patriarchy is bad seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men and i dont believe in battling hate with hate dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering world dominated by men but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal which the barbie word is pinning us against each other is not helpful as we should work together to reach equality one cannot work without the other what could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste,0.6633,positive,True

first of all i really loved this movie i think its fun and entertaining and i really think its done with a lot a passion for the original material the references are clever and i couldnt help but smile each time i saw a barbie i had as a child specially midge i loved her its a very colorful movie and its so refreshing to see that specially with all the gray movies we get nowadays the characters in barbie land are fun and innocent it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way its filmed the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child plus i really loved ken and i think ryan gosling did a great job he was hilarious the kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for mehowever this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasnt for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the moviefirst of all the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this partthe scene where a man simply smacks barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings more so the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and i really didnt like them coming to the barbie world the deprogramming all the barbies was too forced for me and i would prefer if barbie herself did thatwhich leads me to the final part the politicsafter seeing the real world patriarchy ken a character that lived his whole life just to please barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that is he right no of course not but i think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment and for me the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end but it didnt i mean it did a little bit but not enough in my opinion it would have been awesome if the barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them but instead they chose to make a joke that the kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world it really missed the point of making barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and womenanyway this my review of the movie and in conclusion close kenough to a perfect movie",0.9987,positive,True

480,ed-12055,22-Jul-23,i loved the set design acting and personal development of the characters the nuance and meaning but didnt like the rushed storyline production obviously invested a great deal in the set design barbie dream houses and wardrobes it was pink everything with blue beach with a plastic vibe it was cool how they incorporated the barbie box and different outfits something i loved as a child i also thought tv barbie was a blast from the past 90s baby here and learned about other dolls like midge skipper and alan also they didnt do poor midge any justice she was played by a terrific actress so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character i thought alan was played very well thoughi thought that margot robbie and ryan gosling played their characters perfectly capturing their characters development and different nuances you could definitely see barbies transformation into a human but margot did a good job at keeping barbie at her core even in human formsome of my favorite storylines included the war of the kens the discovery of patriarchy the brainwashing of the barbies and the takeover of the barbies  againhowever the switch to the real world and back felt rushed as well as the relationship development between sasha and gloria and barbie really what should have happened was a two part movie to fully tell the story or a 3 hour movie i also felt they spent too much time in barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting boredfor example sasha and gloria meet barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to barbie world i felt like barbie should have had to work to make them believe her making the discovery of barbie world by sasha and gloria even sweeter and barbies transformation into human even more complex i wish i got to see her learn more about becoming human i absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end but felt that could have been earlier in the movie with the scene with ruth at the endi couldnt discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism it could have easily been both if there was more time spent on barbies transformation to human maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to barbie,0.9979,positive,True
483,heccafast,26-Jul-23,the social commentary was pretty heavyhanded albeit this is to be expected in the barbie movie however it was genuinely funny a lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm there were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once plot was a cute but could have been smarter its nice to see a new movie that isnt just a remake or a sequel but i fully expect to see a franchise for this i appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism in one the of the final scenes the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is,0.9795,positive,True
487,faithfedericaojo,23-Jul-23,barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects from its comedic moments to its unique charm the world it presents is filled with vibrant colors whimsical settings lively music and a sense of fantasy and extravagance visually speaking the film is truly unmatched the actors delivered commendable performances with special applause going to margot robbie and ryan gosling however i must admit that i personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film they struck me as particularly funnywhere the story loses points is in its confusing message while the film clearly aims to promote gender equality the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative it wasnt so much the fact that the pep talks were about women but rather the way they were integrated into the story i want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism as a woman myself i appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtlyi found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film such as alan and several of the barbieskens lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes additionally i would have liked to see more exploration of barbie land and its unique characteristics on a positive note the message about the transient nature of ones life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting,0.9847,positive,True
501,tiheimbaugh,5-Sep-23,barbie is gerwiglite just far too selfaware for its own good to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics gerwig and baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience hey were aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but were still having fun which fine but gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to political astuteness doesnt make for very entertaining or memorable film dialoguealso i long for the often hintedat version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly although i guess the ending sort of posits it as not for everyone but again you see my point as to how overwritten this is the production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe the soundtrack is rife with bland focusgroup pop and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all hollywood movies postcovid seem to have i suppose plastic is appropriate for a movie about americas favorite doll but i watched some of the thin red line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans were able to make beautifullooking movies its indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyones said it is but it could have been so much moremajor points deducted for uncalledfor digs at pavement and the godfather plenty of women love both,0.9878,positive,True
502,keehntara,26-Jul-23,the movie started out fun and strong i agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent set design superb etc however the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better directionwhat i liked it emphasized how with barbiedolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything unfortunately in the real world patriarchy exists and were limited i liked it didnt marry barbie off to ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happywhat i didnt like the stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in barbie land that things got confusing and hard to follow why exactly were all barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical barbiei wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the kens and the barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs maybe ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over barbies dream house he gets acknowledged and gets his space too maybe he hooks up with midge because he moves on maybe he gets a beach house so he can beach off whenever he wants i dont know it was funny i laughed out loud several times glad i saw it just wish they went some different directions,0.9859,positive,True
503,klretheridge,29-Jul-23,great film which has a good balance between politics feminism and film making it was funny sad and exciting with great acting to pull it off the set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line the ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they werent necessary to be discontinued overall a great film and good to see with the family it would be really recommended if you have younger children they should love it,0.9853,positive,True

534,asderei,24-Jul-23,barbie the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of barbies objectification falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes while the films attempt to address social issues and promote selfconfidence among girls is commendable its approach feels onesided and counterproductiveon the positive side barbie does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively the movies soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes bilie eilishs song what was i made for sang by margot robbie and ryan gosling performance in im just ken are the standoutsunfortunately the film takes a heavyhanded approach in addressing gender issues instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding barbie seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progressthe portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush by portraying all male characters as either stupid childish immature or disrespectful towards women the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes alienating a significant portion of its potential audience including male viewers and responsible male role modelsadditionally the excessive focus on harassment groping and dirty looks that barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movies message instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics it leans heavily on extreme examples potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address,0.7506,positive,True

2023s barbie from writerdirector greta gerwig has blown expectations out of the water and not only become the highest grossing film of the year but has captured the zeitgeist to become a veritable cultural phenomenon the film is a fantasy comedy starring margot robbie and ryan gosling with significant supporting roles going to america ferrera issa rae kate mckinnon simu liu rhea perlman and will ferrell the movie is cowritten by gerwigs partner noah baumbach there have been more than a few animated barbie films but this is her first foray into live action as august 2023 comes to an end barbie has set box office records becoming the highest grossing film of the year the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman and is in the top twenty highest grossing films of all timerobbie stars as barbie technically stereotypical barbie and gosling is ken most commonly referenced as beach ken they reside in barbieland which is a matriarchal utopia where many variations of barbies and kens reside in perfect happiness along with a few odd discontinued barbie models these real life dolls are under the impression that life in the real world reflects their happy unencumbered existence in barbieland thanks not in small part to their very existence and the example they set out of the blue barbie begins having odd feelings of morbidity and her perfectness is deteriorating it is determined that her malaise is a reflection of the child playing with her in the real world and she must journey there and set things aright if she is to get her perfect barbie groove back ken joins her and together they venture to the real world which is not the carefree paradise they believed along with that barbie and ken discover the nature of the real world patriarchy which ken attempts to bring back to barbieland threatening its very existence it becomes barbies mission to not only save the girl who has her doll in the real world but also restore barbieland from the lunacy of the kens burgeoning patriarchywhen i first heard barbie was being adapted i was more than a bit skeptical i was intrigued after learning gerwig and baumbach were attached as they are at the forefront of some of the more intelligent film making coming out of hollywood these days still how exactly would barbie play this could be a silly film that turns into a financial disaster instead it walked a hyper intelligent line of silly comedy mixed with incisive social satire and feminist messaging it doesnt do it in a way that talks down to or belittles men though which is also key to an overall success it taps a similar vein that black panther tapped a few years ago for the black community here though it taps the often under served female portion of our population from the opening scene that is a pantomime of the famous 2001 a space odyssey opening it is clear that this is a film maker in control of her craft and the story she is about to embark on especially in this day and age a very blatant feminist core message might not sell but it does its task in such a fun and subversive way encased in a bright candy coated shell with catchy music that it is hard not to get on board if there is any misunderstanding though the message certainly becomes clear in the epic diatribe that is delivered by america ferrera as gloria on what it is like and the expectation placed upon being a woman in our modern society barbie does an excellent job of dissecting the seeming dichotomy of barbie itself that is on one hand the dolls are meant to be empowering for women as the myriad of different barbies come with different careers and different skin tones and are meant to show young girls that they can be anything on the other hand barbie has become a negative stereotype for a perfect unattainable idea of womanhood that contributes to many normal girls feeling inadequate in themselves for a myriad of reasons it has hilarious and pointed commentary on the nature of the patriarchy as goslings ken put the concept in place in barbieland to both hilarious and appalling effect about the only thing that didnt work for me in the story is the mattel board of directors they are yet another example of the real world patriarchy headed by ferrells character the problem is that the real world is set up as more or less a realistic depiction of life in direct counterpoint to the fantasy world that is barbieland the exception to that appears to be mattel and its board of directors which skew towards slapstick lunacy and seem out of place in the primarily real world setting that aside barbie is fun and insightful i think it is clearly targeted toward women and girls especially those with barbie experience but it clearly becomes about women as whole along with that it is accessible to men who go in with an open mind and realize that even as the struggle for equality and self fulfillment has come a long way since 1959 that road continues on and does not dead end in the present",0.9977,positive,True

571,julieshotmail,19-Nov-23,on the surface barbie looks fun and light but nothing could be further from the truth as this movie delves into some dark stuff thats why it works it presents an optimistic world that is all facade and if you peel away the layers you are reminded of the reality that things are not so great you could say that there is some level of menbashing here but that is all in service to how mattel has chosen to portray the ken doll as mere accessory to barbie so the movie doubles down on that and with the comedic talent of ryan gosling the movie gets to up the ante on the patriarchy satire i especially like the part when ken learns and practices to wave his finger no at a female assistant as for the casting of barbie margot robbie does a great job and truly fits the barbie look however in my mind the celebrity actress most physically resembling barbie has always been 1970s priscilla barnes from threes company and kudos to america ferreras funny nuanced portrayal of a mom having an existential crisis how about that monologue i love the satire part of this movie including the musical numbers and i see where they are going with the philosophical musings at the end but the sappiness becomes too much,0.9825,positive,True

580,beatlesfeelin,20-Jul-23,this movie was not what i expected at first but i loved it its been years since i watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic taika waititi said in an interview that hollywood particularly superhero movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life i feel like barbie could be the start of the undarkening of hollywood moviesas a woman with some trauma i love a good gritty womanrun movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a mans world sometimes though you just want some feelgood escapism that isnt forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message acrossive seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didnt make sense i feel like the way they executed it made sense for a barbie movie ive also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since kens arent equal in barbieland i loved that part especially in the same way that i dont like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message i think it also sucks when a movie takes too light of an approach because its scared to actually say something of course the kens arent equal in barbieland 1 ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was loose and 2 they are toys made by people they are a product lol of their makers so yes barbies are in charge but barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny or any form of bigotry states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservientthe audience in the theatre i was in seemed to feel the same way because when the narrator said well the kens have to start somewhere eventually theyll have as much rights as women have in the real world i swear everyone was laughing it really connected with the audience from what i saw so many clever points were made in a nonsensical barbie pink package and it was just perfect if you made it this far on my review youre going to have the best day ever today and tomorrow and the day after that and every day from now until forever 3,0.9959,positive,True

585,lunzie,22-Jul-23,im not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film but im certain that it is 100 a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys and girls dolls and all their accessoriesit doesnt paint the manufacturer in a good light making the ceo ferrell whom i heartily dislike anyway a buffoon along with all the men who occupy the boardroomit makes several wellplaced jabs at patriarchy and the real world but seems disjointed and searching for a meaningful plot i swear this is the last gerwig movie i will subject myself to because i find all of her films to date to be confusing and pointlessthe two leads robbie and gosling are perfect as is the rest of the cast especially kate mckinnon as the weird doll i refuse to write the names of the manufacturer or the dolls as my own little protest of blatant consumerism and marketing to children just once id like to watch a film directed toward children that doesnt include superheros blowing up things violence or product placement,-0.5092,negative,True
590,anyanimeotoho,26-Jul-23,i dont know if ive ever seen anything quite like barbie which is rewarding if you ask me especially since i havent been this excited for any other release this year so what did i think of itfor starters i really admire the production of this movie gorgeous does not begin to describe the sets and its commendable how well they highlight the surrealism of barbieland i had seen a youtube video exploring barbies dreamhouse and already concluded in my mind that it was pretty great but seeing it in the context of the movie just made it better the costumes are great toofurthermore the acting is alright huge props to margot robbie the movie blends humour and angst with some other tonal elements which means that it demands more from the actors than you would assume at first the ensemble cast was obviously up to the task but something in their performances caught my attention i vaguely remember gerwig mentioning in an interview the issue of considering the technicalities of a typical barbies movements you can notice several points in the movie where the actors embrace the stiff and wooden movements of a doll but at other less noticeable or relevant moments theyre as flexible as a living entity whilst in barbieland i dont know how one would navigate a perfectly adequate balance between the two but my brain couldnt ignore this mild inconsistency whether you consider it important or not and i do the film did utilize this for comedic effect though and i thought that was a nice touchwhile there are more things i like than dislike about this movie i feel like the execution leaves something to be desired the first act of the movie is everything id hoped it would be campy funny and exceedingly pink i love that even the subsequent scenes in barbieland embrace this quirkiness irrespective of the stakes however the transition from barbie and cos everyday shenanigans to her journey of awareness and selfdiscovery felt a bit sudden while it aptly gives focus to the main conflict of the movie i feel like the heavy marketing of the movie had already given away too many glimpses of barbieland before i saw the film it took away the element of wonder and left the superficial part of me a little disappointed also the final twothirds of the movie is just shy of overstimulating i hate to say it but the reinforcement of women empowerment ideals isnt done tastefully and comes off harsher than it should and the sharp tonal change preceding it doesnt help the exploration of switched gender roles from barbieland to the real world was another clever idea whose execution lacked finesse this made ryan goslings ken briefly unlikeable to me he saved the performance with his undeniable charisma and sense of humour and even though i thought the ending was a nice surprise that scene with the billie eilish number is one of the most beautiful things ever i was sadly distracted by the nonsubtlety of the preceding events however funny or thoughtful they were perhaps i would appreciate it better with a second watchso yeah barbie is an experience tune in for the colourful heaps of fun and stay for the emotional and humanistic themes but beware of the untidy edges,0.9985,positive,True
599,overconsumer450,20-Aug-23,i am shocked at how polarizing this movie has been in terms of feedback i say this as someone who was not anxiously anticipating its release nor as someone who was triggered by its growing popularity i went into this with neutrality i knew this would have more powerful messaging than it seemed as i am a fan of gerwigs previous works but i knew if it did not that the film probably would leave me unfulfilled for that reason i was most bored during the first section of the film that was too lighthearted childlike for my taste but i was excited to get into the deeper plot points this being said i recognize the film was marketed ingeniously to produce buzz however it was ineffective in describing what the movie was really about i can totally see why parents may have thought this was appropriate for children despite the pg13 rating but this absolutely was not made for kids this was a campy commentary on the patriarchy in america and the modern feminist movement these plot points were actually my biggest criticisms of it from my perspective this displayed an accurate depiction modern feminism which often neglects to acknowledge its roots grown by in black feminists and the patriarchies disproportionate effects on low income women especially those of color this movie promoted a feminist message that feels decades behind and in such an obvious way that i am shocked that this explored new ideas or dramatically moved anyone in the audience it was a blunt reminder of how behind we are but not even through the messaging in the film but rather how viewers are reacting the only feminist commentary beneath surface level that i wouldve been more excited to explore were made via side comments from various side characters like the socialistanarchist daughter who by the way i found upset to have seen painted as mean and then only kind after conforming to barbies ideas of feminism but i digress with all that being said it had a fantastic soundtrack made me laugh quite a few times and ryan goslings acting was superb ironically although the whole cast did well with the script they were given justice for michael ceras character i wouldve loved to see his cravings to break away from societal norms be further explored the movie was fun campy in a more obvious way than i usually like but thats the mainstream hollywood box office industry for you my overall take is this wasnt made for a person like me who craves exploring new ideas or highlighting important calls to action as they relate to feminism rather than this rehashing this surface level antipatriarchy message i am glad that this is making people converse in what im understanding are new ideas to many i am just shocked that they are in fact new,0.9937,positive,True
606,bberisha-23891,13-Aug-23,obviously everyone and their mom knew of the hype this movie has made and it was thats why i brought myself to see the movie in the cinema instead of waiting for its online releasethankfully so  the movie was an amazing journey and boy did i enjoy coming alongi really really enjoyed the movies dive into the more tricky aspects of our gendered world and the politics around itit made a good critcism of the shallow liberal understanding of feminism and its rightwing critics  it explores the ideas of a better egalitarian way without making it unfunny serious or dullamazing movie,0.9228,positive,True
607,cinemastastic,3-Sep-23,the movie that breaks all norms and once again proves that following the norm does not get you anywhere the emotional roller coaster with a colourful palette is an absolute masterpiece of story telling with strong social messaging the songs touch the right emotions and at times the audience were visibly tearful barbie represents every one of us  all the characters shine through and the actor and the story is bold mattel have proved to be visionary in being bold and addressing the shortcomings of their marketing  this takes a lot of guts the movie absolutely hammers home the point  representation matters and there is a barbie in each one of us,0.9493,positive,True
621,TheSurrealist,21-Jul-23,with movies like everything everywhere all at once and beau is afraid having come out recently barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism meta commentary and surrealism to create a wacky funny beautiful and touching film about some type of social commentary with barbie we get commentary on feminism consumerism and existentialism it leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast the costume makeup and set design are lavishly created and i wouldnt be surprised if it won oscars for all of these categories the cast does a fantastic job and i dont think there could have been a better ken or barbie greta gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie its a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods perfectly timed comedic quips and genuine emotional moments that make you think,0.9939,positive,True

this movie is like a firework starts bright and promising but ends up fading into the darknessso basically barbie selfishly sets out to help the girl who is playing her in order to restore her perfection  wich turns out to be an adult woman but in the end the girl ends up saving barbie and barbieland with little to no resolution to her own problems  but through all this barbie realises she doesn want to go back to being perfect for everyone to project their ideals on her but just live as a regular human cute right yeah they only problem is nothing was convincing the adventures of our characters were not enough to transform them yet they did change the only well developed character was ken not only his character arc was amazing compared to the others it also was a fine commentary of how patriarchy damages young men so of it was called ken then i would have rated it like 7 but its a barbie movie and unfortunately our female lead had the laziest character arc and the most deus ex machina development everironically she was through it all really sweet and likeable maybe a meta commentary of what women are appreciated for sweet and likeable is enough but anything more is too much and also she only wants to be seen as human if so i congratulate the movie but i dont think it was clear enough to give it credit formaybe thats what you get when you are sponsored by whom you are supposed to critique lol
ps i am a woman and a feminist and still hated it",0.9946,positive,True
635,jbermerubio,26-Jul-23,it is a film of absurd humour which is funny in many moments that criticises political models fragile masculinity and society both past and presentthe approach is to turn current society on its head and make barbieland a world dominated by women where they form the elite of society and the kens are simply their boyfriends irrelevant unemployed kept objects basically what women are in the macho societywhen barbie and ken arrive in the real world barbie realises that the world is upside down that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men and ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in barbieland so far the script and the critics are being perfectafter a lot of criticism of the heteromale behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour the critical moment arrives the message of the film the barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly dont want to go back to the previous model where they ruled i say supposedly because they do go back to that model one ken asks the president of barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the presidents answer is yes but from below and little by littlein the end the barbies after discovering the reality of the real world adopt the same model they do not accept the kens as equals no let them gradually integrate just as it has happened with women who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women it was the perfect time to talk about equality to think about a new model about evolution and there is no solution the barbies continue with the model of todays society so the film doesnt contribute anything what is the wonderful message they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against if you make a social and political criticism you have to propose your own solution in barbie there is no solution the solution is the current systemtherefore it is overrated and on top of not showing the reality of the barbie world they show barbies of all races and sizes do they sell xxl barbies or barbies and ken of all races they show a diversity that the barbie universe has never had,0.7526,positive,True
639,benjhoy,7-Aug-23,i was really excited to see barbie but sadly the film came up short for meon the positive side of things the film has plenty of creativity and the idea of recreating the dolls actual world was a cool one no stairs no liquid in cups feet permanently on tip toes etc margot robbie was excellent as always cudos to mattel for their willingness to sign off on a film that depicts their company in such a negative light that isnt something you commonly seeon the negative side of things the plot felt a bit like a rehash of the dozen or so other films ive seen that feature a two worlds colliding theme a lot of the silly ideas i was expecting to find funny the beach off fell flat for me and seemed to rely more on just saying the same joke over and over rather than using it in a creative waythe films messages about the crushing weight of societys expectations on women and the uneven distribution of powerrespect felt hamstrung by the lack of depth in the characters ken gosling comes off as an idiot for the entire film and the ceo of mattel feels more like a cartoon villain than a real person in the end the barbies dont aim to create a more just society but are content instead to simply replicate problematic structures in the opposite direction the film ends with little to no character development no one seems to have learned anything by the end of the film the patriarchy which this film centers around is reduced in places to drinking brewskies horses and brainwashing those kind of reductions make it hard to appreciate the social message that the film portrays and sells the audiences intelligence shortpart of the problem for me i think is i am unsure of who the target audience for this film is meant to be if this is meant for children the simplistic characters and over the top messaging might make sense but the themes and jokes feel a bit dark and too adult for them if this is meant for adults the characters lack the nuance that gerwig was able to show in some of her other work ladybirdin the end there are a few fun moments in this film but the films heavy handed messaging mixed with the lack of depthnuance in characters means it doesnt hit nearly as hard as it probably should have,-0.6105,negative,True
641,vladamisa,26-Jul-23,this movie is not for kids despite the trailers i saw not showing it may not be for kids i only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world the sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy the sub plot should have been the main plot the set design was great the world looked beautiful the story just sucked not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and i thought they leaned way to hard into this if they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least i grew up playing with barbies and i am sorry but my barbies always loved their kens for barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion there was not enough barbieland and too much stupidity,0.5789,positive,True
643,androkyrie_,22-Jul-23,barbie directed by greta gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 from the first photos on set to the huge marketing barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor it delivers amazing performances from the whole cast robbie and gosling with unmatched chemistry ferreras monologue and everybody elsethe message is clear how it is to be a woman in this reality a mother a daughter feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter greta managed to tell us how impactful barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to selfconscious girlsshe exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy at first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but youll understand that the same barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes this judgment is already solved in the message of the movie greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moralits camp its fun and its popthe script is smart and well written it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation barbie and ruth handler and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by gloria ferrera theres a handful of cinema references from kubricks 2001 space odyssey to the wizard of oz there are jokes on movies that arent to be taken to seriously youll find them funnyjokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that youll absolutely agree withits not only a feminist message but barbie expands its themes to kens character the difficulty to found his own identity to be someone outside of his shadow his barbiethis film is demential and intelligent an adaptation of the loveable doll you can have fun with it but also write a whole essay about its moral and heart,0.9889,positive,True
650,mlterry88,26-Jul-23,so many positive messages for women and men alike barbie has an existential crisis and ken embraces the worst of the patriarchy both just seeking deeper meaning  what were they made for meaningful subtext while being wildly entertainingall the acting was just delightful ryan gosling even steals the show  though every performance was spot on thanks to greta gerwig and mattel for an innovative thought provoking gloriously vibrant extravagant movie watching experience it is destined to be a classiceven better it has stirred up controversy that hopefully can lead to discourse on the themes embedded in something with such great entertainment value,0.9741,positive,True
652,kellyrusk,7-Aug-23,i bought into the marketing hype and boy did this movie deliver it was smart funny charismatic visually pleasing and touchingit was both a perfect social commentary on the world today from a place of empathy and understanding for both men and women from some haters online i thought it was going to be overly feminist which i have no problem with but i think it perfectly expressed how patriarchy is detrimental for men as well as womenbut more importantly it was hilarious kate mckinnon stole the show but the acting was solid all around really excited to see what greta gerwig does nexti heard this movie just surpassed 1billionthe results speak for themselves,0.9792,positive,True
653,emeryb-78668,8-Sep-23,this movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion literally i dont care if you dont like barbies or pink because this movie is so much more than that it makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is the movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about barbie dolls and the development barbie the movie was very mature in my opinion and isnt necessarily a kids movie even though its called barbie a doll it didnt have too much k18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a childoverall absolutely beautiful movie and really touching its not only about toys its about life go watch it,0.4234,positive,True
656,josephirose,26-Jul-23,this movie was incredible it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas it really stood out to me how the worst the kens had to go through in barbieland was being ignored and being not very important while the second barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified it ended up still being up to barbie to apologize to ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong this movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad with the funny and tender moments i love great gerwig and would for sure see this again,0.9417,positive,True
661,brocklawmurphy,23-Jul-23,this movie was a massive let down it was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face i dont care about politics when im watching a movie and i expect a well written story this film is just bad and i was actually interested in it i had high expectations for this film and i think it did not deliver its not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that i created an account just to leave a bad review what did i even see in this film its a barbie movie,-0.7684,negative,True
669,artbyfalcon,25-Jul-23,honestly this is the best movie ive ever seen the roles are so perfectly played and everyone did such a good job on this movie i love it so much came with a bunch of friends my mom their moms and my little sister everyone said that they lived the movie the ending made me cry but in such a good way like how barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time seeing a movie that doesnt have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing and honestly if youre mad at this movie you might be part of the problem seeing ruth appear and give barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience i loved it so much i cant even explain seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshingwhen the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into itand can we talk about how well will ferrell played his role and dont even get me started on margots acting literally amazing she played her role so wellthis movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more at the end when barbie said her name barbara was so amazing because she was originally named after ruths daughter i loved that so muchand honestly i think that everybody needs to see this movie no matter what your standpoint on life is everyone needs to see this movieand seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing i could go on and on about how good this movie made me feel but i would be here all dayit was such a good movie and i would definitely watch it again such a good watch,0.9986,positive,True
683,matthewreinink,12-Nov-23,this movie is not completely worthless like i was expecting it to be when i saw the trailer there are some good comedic bits in this movie and the acting is fairly good there is also a lot more substance to this film than i was expecting this movie really is geared towards adults rather than kidsi appreciate the movie touching on some interesting topics like the impact that barbie has had on body image her impact on gender roles and the unhealthy obsession with material items it is certainly a bold move by the director one that could have been executed better at times the delivery of the messaging feels too clunky including a shakespearean monologue from america ferrera this is also a movie that doesnt seem to want to end the final 15 minutes drag with an inefficient wrap up sequence,0.9401,positive,True
686,aipsun,26-Aug-23,as one of the most anticipated films of the year barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations especially cinephiles  and make it the most daring film of the year director greta gerwig supported by screenwriter noah baumbach doesnt just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon colorful set designs stunning costumes and makeup great music they all sing the history of the barbie doll but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism patriarchy feminism diversity inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense as a film barbie delivers it all fun excitement and seriousness the casting of margot robbie and ryan gosling as barbie and ken is also the right choice barbie reminds us again that summer box office hits can be really fun and good,0.9791,positive,True
695,bottledorangejuice,31-Jul-23,this movie was a great way to redefine what barbie stands for teenagers and adults  as well it was a great way to open up a thoughtful conversation with kids and adults about common world problemsnowadays barbie is held at a standard of just being pink and girly and frilly but this movie did such a great job redefining it showing how the barbie universe was so relatable in the most unlike of ways was mindblowingaside from the movie addressing things like feminism patriarchy matriarchy selfesteem etc barbie brings up an array of positive character development traits throughout one of the main was how in the beginning of the movie  she was settled with her life and didnt want anything to change and during the middle didnt want to take any accountability or initiative when the kens took over but as the movie progressed it didnt a great job of showing barbie taking action solving problems and making life changing decisionsthere is so much good to address in the movie for the people who didnt get the point of it they have to rewatch it with an open mind because there is so much to unpack in it the cast the music the script,0.9636,positive,True
700,kmkrhia,31-Jul-23,as most are saying the casting was great the costumes were awesome barbie land set design was on point the story could have been so much better it started out fine but dragged in the middle it became preachy we know we live it everyday mention patriarchy and move on i thought it would have been nice to show both sides working together equally in the end it might not have been realistic but we would have left the theater with a smile i was not alone leaving the theater thinking what was that all about i did not see too many children in the theater which was good because it would have been way over their head,0.9595,positive,True
701,t-65804,21-Jul-23,barbie is a very good start movietry to popularize the feminism idea to normal people many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea after watching this movie i realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach women as the party being objectified are always in the status of the object being stared at when i saw let me show you in the movie theater all the girls laughed and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol the biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film which i loved it is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up,0.987,positive,True
708,vanwierreinder,24-Jul-23,i liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it i did think the feminism was a little too on the nose sometimes but its difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences overall it was a job well done the set was beautiful and everything expected from a barbie movie simu liu and ryan gosling were showstealers as rivalling kens and margot robbie was perfectly cast i was also really surprised that the slogan a movie for people who love barbie and people who hate barbie caught the essence they didnt shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the barbie dolls and mattel as a company,0.9657,positive,True
712,The_Lyllee_Evans,18-Sep-23,i watched this movie in the theater 9 weeks after its release when the crowd of the barbenheimer made its exit safely it was time for me to move in not dressed in pink none of the 6 of us in the audience was and watch it away from the hypeand boy was i grateful i didbecause the herds of my mid thirties millennial peers that saw it before me were hyped about the nostalgia of being a girl again they also singlemindedly agreed that this movie is such a feel good movieand it is if you ignore the sharp societal commentary the selfcriticism on mass consumerism and capitalist dogma our society is based upon the sexes are seeking validation from and at the end of the day our relationship with ourselves and anyone around us is defined sure womanhood and manhood are not deeply portrayed in this pink firework after all one of kens first lines is that pining whisper of i love you too whilst she waltzes off in her matriarchal utopia after all  thanks to barbie all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solvedglorias monologue can easily go above your head if the pretty dresses and perfect hairdos are flashing in front of your eyes its understandable not wanting to listen to her sum of womans existence in a couple of minutes to the point that it felt like a knife to the gut and i was trying to control my sobsi am sorry this is not a feel good movie greta gerwig is holding up a mirror to all of us and points the finger of accountability this movie will age as a fine wine and it will be as timeless as barbies last line that defines the origins of us all,0.9758,positive,True
718,hannahgawne,30-Jul-23,as someone who has been a fan of barbie since i was a little girl this movie was an incredible journey the set was beautiful the cast was great and the soundtrack amazing my favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively it was achieved in a light hearted and caring way the original hopes and dreams of barbies existence are brought to life as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish in a world which does not always cater to womens needs this film does a great job of holding us all accountable we now live in a postbarbie movie era and im so excited to see what the future holds,0.9897,positive,True
719,bandymex,21-Jul-23,its a shame because i love little women and lady bird barbie did not serveits a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid im agreeing with the latter but the execution is just awful the ceo and corporate people of mattel started as a mock to men having all the top positions of a company as the movie goes theyre just there at the back of your mind and its unpleasant experience because they did not do anything after so many unnecessary scenes that couldve been meaningful for example whats the scene allan fighting other kens for there are so many seeds planted at once but none of them grew into their fullest potential here are some examples1 the mother and daughter relationship it started well the daughter is disconnected with her mother you thought the movie will revolve about fixing that problem no the daughter has no problem shes just a teenager2 mothers longing for her daughter the reason why barbie became curious about death is because the mother is playing with her barbie differently shes drawing weird sigh barbies you thought it was because she had a rough childhood and now is the time to heal her inner child no she misses her time playing with her daughter while it is an alright backstory i see no reason how it is related to barbie getting curious on death3 patriarchy its always shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses the corporate people who are all men tries to catch barbie so they can send her back to barbieland but barbie went to barbieland and they still followed her it took them too long to get there for no apparent reason and when they get there it just gets very confusing why are they in there4 barbie wanting to be human this shouldve been the theme of the movie the point of the movie shouldve been about what barbie saw to make her realize she wants to be human but no it was only a few minutes when shes seeing people laughing and some people are sad after that there was no more of it they tried to push this in the ending but it just doesnt feel right because of the lack of motivation although it was expected they wasted the whole time with cameos and other meaningless scenesi am disappointed in this movie its not worth the hype,-0.99,negative,True
732,nick-galanis,26-Aug-23,"have you watched barbieyes i am talking about the smash movie that topped the global box office broke records and made 1 billion dollars in just 17 dayswe watched the movie recently and couldnt help but think that the success was anything but coincidentalthis is the most successful movie directed by a woman everit champions intersectional feminism showing a world where1 black women can be presidents
2 trans women can be doctors
3 disabled women can dance and join the party
4 plus size women can be desired
5 mature women can mentor encourage and support younger women
6 men can be allies and support womens causeswhat i also loved is that the movie showed that1 men can find happiness when they decide to be themselves rather who society expects them to be
2 you can still be a man and cry and love yourself and support others without having to fight and prove your masculinity
3 women dont need men to be happy and vice versa
4 theres beauty in the mundane and everyday experiences such as going to the doctorit is obvious that the team behind this movie was incredibly diverseyou can see diversity of thought and willingness to include different people and groups in almost every scene  wow diversity  inclusion is not just the right and ethical thing for every company to do it is also something that creates masterpieces and makes  go barbie go diversity and inclusion",0.9982,positive,True
733,apriljosey-29034,27-Jul-23,so the barbie movie was mehtheres been a ton of hype about the films political bent and honestly yes the patriarchal nonsense is a bit heavy handed but thats not even what made it so badit was just dumbit was too long and nonsensical and i really dont know how to sum it up other than thati laughed a couple of times and one or two parts almost resonated with me but then it just went from relatable to preachy and i just eyerolled so hardit was mostly just boring and dumb and thats disappointing because it looked great the cast was great and it had such potential to be a great selfaware meta comedy it just failed so hard at doing thatmy summary barbie gains sentience fights the patriarchy becomes a real girl and goes to the gynecologistthis movie will not appeal to young kidsi can almost guarantee theyll find it boringits not a typical kids movie riddled with double entendres and overtheirheads adult humor its just adult humor and its not even particularly funny just my opinionit absolutely looks amazing it looks like it was made with kids in mind it looks like a nostalgia trip for moms and it looks like family funhowever with the exception of looking amazing it accomplishes none of that the mario movie did all of those things sooo much better in my opinion that movie was darn near perfectif you wanna see barbie go for it but if youre considering taking little kids i would not personally recommend it ,0.9902,positive,True
734,clerk8952,27-Sep-23,i was excited to see this movie because i heard gosling was so funny it starts out very strong the kens are laugh out loud funny gosling steals every scene he is in robbie isnt bad but they wrote her character to be emotional and boring in fact all of barbies are boring in comparison to the kens as the movie moves past barbieland it starts to struggle as the story develops there are several scenes from this point on focusing on how barbie robbie must find out who she is essentially these scenes drag on and kill any momentum the previous scene built the movie rams against the patriarchy often ironically the funniest scenes involve the kens and how the patriarchy benefits them then mattel comes into the story and that drags on this movie should have been 20 minutes shorter and focused more on overcoming stereotypes not condemning the patriarchy over and over legally blonde is a superior movie in so many ways,0.8197,positive,True
735,imanin-33081,3-Sep-23,greta gerwig should be proud of herself and so should everyone involved in the making of barbie because it was such a great film  i watched barbie on the first day it came out and the cinema was packed when it got to the scene where the mum was telling the barbies what its really like to be a woman the audience were clapping because they agreed and it creates such a lovely atmosphere that ive never been in or felt at the cinema  many people who havent watched the movie seem to have a problem with it because they think its just about feminism when its now because when the barbies eventually got there power back they didnt create a matriarchy like the kens creating a patriarchy but they found a way to live as close to equally as they could overall barbie is a great film and you should watch it no matter what anybody says because you will feel changed in a sort of way that you cant put into words after seeing it,0.9396,positive,True
742,rjlyness,7-Aug-23,the opening scene parodying 21st century a space oddacy was hilarious i like it clever its an idea dropped into the world which changed the society fundamentally babies be gone professional dolls here we comei suppose its then interesting when barbie does encounter the real world and finds it not to have changed it does not represent the ideals they hold in the barbie world which they thought had spread through the world creating a new reality no barbie in the real world is just one idea in a sea of ideasits then fascinating to see ken enter the real world he finds out that barbie is not the only idea that exists there are others however instead of using this new information to find and build his own identity he quickly discoveres the patriarchyusing the pariachy as a tool to surpress and subordinate women in the world which women had built for themselves his whole life he has believed that all that matters is barbie and barbies world he therefore returns to barbieworld to use his new found power to dominate as a form of revenge his obsession with barbie has not dissappeard it has manifest in a new way he is now taking revenge on himself in a way as he acts out behaviours which serve him superficially but dont actually nourish his soul his true person hes mimicking the behavior or barbie trying to make her feel the way he felt toxic masculinity and domination its an identity born out of pain and obsessionhis story ach is the most simple to understand he learns from barbie that he can love himself he can form his own identity which doesnt revolve around someone else his identity can be one which is very personal to him and not one that exists to serve the needs of others or to impress others he ends his obsession and idolization of barbie and looks to love his friends his kensbarbie existing in barbieworld finds herself to be always happy fully in love with herself and powerful in that love for herself she creates an entire world which functions beautifully or so she believesits almost like barbieworld is the internal personal world of an imagined player of the barbie game its ordered and structured to produce good outputs mental stability this sense of perfect is safe and change is not welcome why would barbie ever want to change when barbie is perfecthowever the real world as barbie later finds out is messy and complex we watch as the feelings insecurities and anziety of the mother gloria are spilled onto the page and into the world of barbiebarbie goes to weird barbie who shes is told can cure herweird barbie is the way that she is because some child decided they didnt want to be any of the barbies that were in offer and so created her own character in a rather chaotic manner weird barbie is created out of emotional expression and therfore has the ability to feel her negative emotionsshe offers barbie the choice to go back to how things were before or to go on a mission to find the source of the problem barbie instantly chooses to revert back and not to address the problem barbie embodies a toxic positivity and fear of change which prevents her from accepting or noticing the problems within her reality and within the real world fear of change fear of negative emotionsin later entering the human world she encounters lots of negativity which she doesnt know how to address its not in her programming its not what i am made for eventually we see her sit looking out to the sea and look internally in doing this she is able to access and feel her emotions the fear the insecurity the anziety she cries turning to the old lady on the bench next to her she tells her she is beautiful she has learned to see her fears feel her feelings and feel awe at the beauty of an imperfect worldshes once again crushed by the daughter who tells her succinctly what she feels about barbie as a tool of the patriarchy and capitalismbarbie feels her feelingsbarbie had gone into the conversation with the goal of fixing the girl whod gone rougeshe learns here that she cant fix the problems presented by the child because she cant even begin to understand themretreating back into uncertainty she willingly goes back to a figure of authority mattel who say they can help get her back home safein mattel hq she finds out that these men have no idea what theyre doing they want to put her back in the box as if the world has not changed and she with it she sees at the last moment that she cant go back there was something rotten from the beginning and she cant go back in the box she needs to figure out how to change itshe needs to figure out what she was made forthis new version of her with the new feelings she need to find her creatorfortunately enough she encounters her instantlyher creator is the one who when arriving back in barbieworld now kenland can effectively fight the idea of patriarchy that has infected the minds of the womenits almost like mettel are telling us that they are listening to the voices of those fighting the patriarchy and are making a commitment to change and be different in the making of this filmbarbie gets her story ach ending when she comes to peace with her fear of death she accepts mortality its again as if mattel are telling us the idea of barbie is not immortal and will die and it may have died with this generation but were adapting and ready to changebarbie the idea the perfect barbie the perfect margot robbie ideal barbie the ideal is not real i was an ideal look so alive turns out its not real what was i made forthe ideal must dieit would be beautiful if they discontinued the original barbie doll after this filmthe ideal never really exitedits a slightly dissatisfying ending in a way because all of the power imbalances and structural patriarchal or matriarchal in the barbie world ideas still persistthe fascist idiology as the daughter put itthe world of women in power is confined to an imaginary world and men remain dominant in mattel and in the real worldwe dont see a story arch for the society as it never really changes were told in a way to accept that only incremental tiny changes are allowed and large structural reform is pushed aside as unrealistic,0.992,positive,True
745,karlasjunco,24-Jul-23,i think everybody should watch this movie this movie will change someones perspective of the world if someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it margot robbie did an excellent job portraying barbie would totally rewatch this movie this movie made me laugh cry and made me think about my childhood its such a beautiful movie greta gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation truly the best movie released this year she even broke box office record for female directors love barbie and everyone should watch it,0.9633,positive,True
746,jjasonh,26-Jul-23,the barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot but was overall a hilarious movie to watch while many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men they are looking at it the wrong way they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them all while keeping the barbie theme at the heart of the plot it addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is a patriarchy which isnt necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in powerful positions in society,0.9695,positive,True
747,maybe24597,2-Aug-23,i liked the inital idea where they aproach sexism thru barbie the oldes concept of feminism that actually took a opposite turn but the point was neither here nor there and i felt like it changed as the movie continued the ending was whole another story and not well put together with the rest of the plot i found the characters too romantic poetic and naive the parts that i did like was ryan goslings acting some parts of his character were pretty funny also the musical numbers were great and i liked the costumes and props also the idea of life in barbieland is kind of funny and amusing,0.9866,positive,True
751,santiagoxavier-44151,23-Jul-23,boring uninteresting movie it was fun at the beginning but the on going topic about feminism ruined the movie felt unnecessarily long dont really recomendits good in the beginning and the experience its not terrible dont like the fact its too long and you end up getting bored ken plays a role but its overly complicated and annoying dont really know how this is rated as a good movie most like a 510 movie that you shouldnt watch at the cinemafinally dont enjoy watching it at the big screen rx and other cinematography was mid and dont look like a worth it movie to watch or invest time and money,-0.3447,negative,True
752,RyanGoslins-son,21-Jul-23,the movie is amazing margot robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a truman show vibe for me  ryan gosling is amazing as ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles however i feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that arent specific to feminism overall i do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie for example if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative in conclusion i feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 78 for me personally at least a 85 or higher therefore i have decided to put 1010 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly,0.9836,positive,True
763,karlskeys-94736,20-Jul-23,we saw a prescreening of the barbie movie last night i loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of barbie scattered through the film there were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power its not a good balance the actors were brilliant and ryan goslings portrayal of ken was just perfection margot robbie made the perfect stereotypical barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery all in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script great for barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to barbie from their childhoods,0.9893,positive,True
764,cklmewmew,22-Jul-23,this movie had so much potential it was doing so well for a while it was funny and clever and had depth and i was super excited to see where it was going to go but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent even problematic conclusion im almost angry at it even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them diebtw its definitely not for under 12s there is nothing inappropriate in it so they could technically watch it for the visual aspect they just wouldnt understand much spoilers some of the elements where the movie deeply disappointed me are below please dont read any further if you havent watched the film yet and want these elements to be a surprisekens developmentken realises that men arent treated as equals in barbieland and creates his own patriarchy which in the end the barbies tear down when ken bursts into tears thinking that he will have to go back to a life where he is oppressed  that could have been developed and executed so beautifully barbie even told him its ok to cry this could have moved towards all kens understanding that they need to express their vulnerable emotions in order to not be angry and toxic and the barbies need to stop the oppression of men because its just as bad as oppressing anyone and it could have led to equality in barbieland but no turns out ken is in fact crying because he has an unhealthy anxious attachment to barbie and his ego cant take the news that barbie is not in love with him and then the movie concludes with ken agreeing to explore who he is individually without barbie this would be an ok conclusion if it wasnt for abandoning all the other deeper seeds planted before with some other kens getting middle management jobs in the once again matriarchal barbieland society but not leadership positions the same way it is for women in the real world seriously its like this was written by men the barbies are going for revengebarbies developmentbarbie wants to be human and again this could have been developed with emotional and intellectual depth and there is an attempt at the beginning to show the reason barbie started to have these thoughts where she is seeing humans express all these complex emotions and shes seeing the beauty of the world around her in all those small magical details in nature that feel more intense than usual but then this thread is dropped completely so much so that in the end when barbie is asking to be human it doesnt make sense why and the narrator has to literally do a voiceover speech to explain it badly and then when she is finally human her first and very overhyped trip is to the gynaecologist implying that what shes most excited about being human is having a vagina again written by men this movie is literally setting women back 50 yearsdevelopment of the mother  daughter relationshipnot much to say other than how shallow this remains despite setting it up as if it was going to go somewhere barbie goes to the real world to find this teenage girl whose emotions are causing her to malfunction the malfunctioning focused on cellulite which is a whole other horror story it then turns out its actually the girls mum who is playing with barbie and feeling these emotions because her life isnt fun and her daughter is hostile with her and then at some point out of nowhere the mother and daughter start hugging and smiling at each other thats it were not going into why she was hostile in the first place and why she isnt any more teenagers are not hostile for no reason were not touching on why the mum was feeling that way and what made her not feel that way any more it clearly wasnt just her daughter but everything is suddenly fine now oh ok thenallanthis is so chaotic i dont even know where to start so he has a particularly sensitive  gay  queer vibe and i think they are trying to make him into a hero like he fights a bunch of kens for no apparent reason  they really could have used that scene for something else but the point of him is unclear hes an ally to the barbies and theres only one of him which i always think is actually a bit problematic to have only one token representative of the lgbtq community in a film although i get that in real life mattel didnt have that much diversity and they were trying to stay true to that his motivation siding with the barbies in the patriarchy seems to be the fact that he feels invisible too but the movie doesnt go into this at all and kind of ignores him the same way the characters do like hes a hero simply by being different from the kens and helping the barbies but how he feels throughout this and what he gets out of it in the end if anything is anyones guess its not clear whether or how things change for him at all they dont seem to despite all the effortweird barbiewhen barbies are played with too hard they turn weird  strange make up and clothes cut and messed up hair always in splits so far very funny but why does weird barbie remain perceived weird throughout why doesnt anyone realise that she is just as beautiful still as the other barbies despite her unusual hair and makeup and nonperfection or why doesnt anyone realise that she basically saves barbieland and it doesnt matter in the slightest what she looks like shes a hero thanks for making all girls who are unusuallooking or not stereotypically beautiful and perfect feel like freaksespecially because of weird barbie and allan the movies diversity just feels so forcedthe board of mattel all real world men who are painfully stupidwith will farrell as ceo first of all what was funny 20 years ago is not really funny any more will farrell should only be in this if there is some clear development of the narrative behind his behaviour but there isnt its all a bit of a mess we get a kick out of the mockery of foolish men at the beginning but they are still in power regardless of anything they are trying to put barbie back in a box but she escapes another missed opportunity  what would have happened if she goes in the box then they chase her into barbieland for no reason they wanted her to go back she goes back so why dont they just celebrate and stay where they are and then theres literally no point of them being there was casting will farrell just an attempt to get middle aged toxic men into the cinemathe cellulite issuebarbie agrees to go to the real world so that she doesnt get cellulite literally i do understand sarcasm and i get that this would be quite funny if we as a society were beyond that already and if there werent any teenage girls watching but the film is a 12 and the beauty industry is making more money out of womens insecurities now than ever if were going to use sarcasm here this needs to be addressed later for example barbie realising that its our uniqueness that makes us beautiful they really missed an opportunity using weird barbie to drive that message and cellulite doesnt matter but no such thing  the movie concludes with the message that cellulite is indeed a malfunction this has got to have been written by menapparently the only man involved in the screenplay was noah baumbach ah coproduced by mattel of course all the male mattel executives must have had a say now it makes sense the movie is fun to watch and its certainly witty especially in the first half and i really liked the performances and visuals there seems to have been strong intention of depth and the movie is very political but ultimately fails to convey the right message and all it ends up being is a clever brand extension to make more money for mattel,0.9942,positive,True

772,pshcpa,9-Aug-23,i watched the barbie movie last night overall i would say that its a very creative dare i say outstanding movie the premise is brilliant albeit kind of uncomfortable with its generalization of gender roles and what id like to think were hyperbolic stereotypes but i am a guy and i definitely have my blind spots as many know however i do try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem after all i do have many capable and strong women in my life that im concerned whether they get treated fairlybut despite these slightly unsettling misgivings its a really funny movie the mixed animation and live action is remarkable and many of the characters are really well written that is aside from the male characters theyre all pretty much one dimensional dullards who generally cant get out of their own way thus its a mix of humorous social commentary with keystone cop slapstick but its so visually rich its like a cinematic ice cream sundaemargot robbie was made for this role her performance was a combination of sweet naivete and compelling poignancy and she looks like a barbie thats remarkable many of the other barbie dolls were performed excellently as well kate mckinnon is really funny in it even though it seemed at times she was adlibriffing a la snl with one eye on the audience but shes very good as the bad barbie i was surprised and pleased to see john cena make an appearance or two as the neptune ken that was pretty funnyboth ryan gosling and simon liu were good as ken and    well ken their characters actually had a little depth to them which allowed them to grow a little over the course of the story america ferrera is a good actor and she was solid but not compelling for my taste her climatic speeches were heavyhanded but they did serve a story development purposeso in short i really enjoyed the movie it was visually compelling and much of the acting outstanding while the story may rankle some ogs out there for anyone who wasis married or has a daughter or a sister or a mother i guess thats everyone they know that women often times have suffered from gender bigotry and so being sympathetic to that i think theyll find it is a really good movie and theres probably nothing wrong with being reminded of that struggle now and thenoh and the music its got a great soundtrack and the final song what was i made for written by both billie eilish and finneas oconnell and sung by billie stopped me in my tracks what a well written song that was so apropos and memorable,0.9988,positive,True
774,bloomwu,23-Jul-23,i never had high expectations for the film due to the number of justokay films that have come out this past year but greta never disappoints lady bird little women and now barbie the movie is surely a gerwig classic it is amazing how the outright unserious campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated realworld issues naturally there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach the writing carried witty humor strong character development and heartfelt experiences all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances margot robbies performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial the same can be said for ryan goslings ken spoilers it is clear that everything ken has done to barbieland bringing patriarchy was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth what he feels he often lacks in barbieland the film features a multitude of wellknown actors that portray a great deal of what a barbie can be the set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a barbie dream house and her clothes were extremely coveted by young girls on the other hand it shows how barbieland is not all it is thought out to be i was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old hollywood soundstage musicals that we never really see anymore this film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to america ferreras performance her monologues feminist themes are reminiscent of saorise ronans monologue from little women it was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity resonating with audiences while the message is not at all new many women especially feel heard the film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up the simultaneous laughing and crying sort overall barbie is a fun glittery social commentary satire about female identity the feminism of hyperfemininity authenticity and community and what it means to be human in our messedup chaotic world for the gerwig fans barbie lovers barbie haters and everyone else go watch barbie,0.997,positive,True
775,sabinasbuzoi,23-Jul-23,this movie has fun aesthetics and fun costumes and sometimes funny moments definitely great actors but the whole ideological feminist spin greta gerwig did in the plot ruins the entire thing honestly and turns a movie that could have been super fun into a bland and boring one i thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society like why does the male gender not own houses why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account and it the end they still dont get houses also this is a misrepresentation of the real world as a woman with a career and decent income i can tell you i in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues instead of portaying equality the movie ends on a note where the male species is dumb and still not on equal footing disappointing,0.9121,positive,True
776,ranmadmax,1-Nov-23,ah the barbie dolla cultural icon that has been both revered and reviled often in the same breath the 2023 film barbie takes us on a whimsical yet poignant journey through the plastic corridors of barbieland a realm that mirrors our own societal norms and prejudices in a way that is both amusing and unsettlingthe film opens in a utopia of sorts where barbies hold esteemed positions and kens are relegated to the beach but all is not well in paradise barbie our protagonist is plagued by an existential crisis that leads her on a quest for selfdiscovery accompanied by her everloyal ken ah the follies of youth even for a doll that never agesthe narrative takes a dark turn when barbie and ken venture into the real world confronting issues of body image gender roles and corporate greed the film doesnt shy away from tackling these heavy subjects and it does so with a deft touch that is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking the days of rebel without a cause may be long gone but the angst of youth remains evergreenthe character of weird barbie serves as a delightful foil to our heroine embodying the societal outcasts who often possess the most wisdom her role in barbies awakening is crucial providing a counterpoint to the superficial world from which she hailshowever the films most striking moment comes when barbie meets the spirit of ruth handler the reallife creator of the barbie doll this metaconversation serves as a reminder that even the most seemingly trivial of objects can have a profound impact on our lives and culture its akin to a modernday wizard of oz where the man behind the curtain is actually a womanthe film concludes on a hopeful note with barbie and her plastic compatriots embarking on a journey of selfimprovement and societal change its a fitting end to a film that challenges our preconceptions at every turn,0.8992,positive,True

784,sketchbooktown,1-Aug-23,it was funny gorgeously done and challenged peoples view points which is a lot done for a movie made by a toy company i found myself laughing and tearing up at certain points i was in awe while watching it in the theaters for the attention to detail on props its insane how well made it isspoilers ish  my only critique is the ending for the kens we sympathise with them throughout the movie and the message is about equal rights for women but feminism is about equal rights for everyone kens deserve their freedom too however it definitely did the job of making men step out of their comfort zone and understanding what its really like to be a woman,0.9703,positive,True
786,clicquotcommie,19-Aug-23,from the opening scenes alluding to the greatest film of all time this movie was captivating witty hilarious aesthetic philosophical surreal unapologetically feminine and feminist just masterful filmmaking that made every minute a delight to watch and made you look forward to rewatching it it pulled no punches in criticism of capitalism and patriarchy i dont agree with criticism that it was a commercial for mattel since they clearly gave greta final edit really dont cant think of a bad thing to say but i do think that this movie felt like a cultural reset that it has changed movies forever in the best possible way,0.9209,positive,True
793,jamesmcwhirty,5-Aug-23,the bright colours will appeal to youngsters and thankfully the mindless feminism will sail over their heads the feminism sticks with young adults but the nostalgia wont appeal and for oldies the nostalgia is fun but the poor script and acting is appalling i think mattel have highlighted in a 2 hour film why their toy is now completely obsolete no matter how hard they try to rebrand it if you like comedy watch the trailer its not just a highlights reel it is the enitrely of anything amsuing in the whole film the cast made the best of a bad script but the writers have missed an opportunity to make a classic comedy for the ages,0.7732,positive,True
795,lrallennyc,23-Sep-23,barbie barbie barbie barbie so disappointed in this film i believed all the hype and the boffo box office people must be hard up for lighthearted fun and too bad that barbie didnt serve that up unfortunately it was less of a movie and more of a twohour mattel commercial and the movie delves into heavyhanded politics that other serious films have done much better serving up feminism hypermasculinity misogyny and beaching you over the head with it was not only disappointing but was it misleading and misappropriated it wasnt the movie i wanted to see but it did have some bright moments especially with kate mckinnon and ariana greenblatt the weirdness factor was on a scale of 10 and i can only rate the movie at a 5 stars but i do give ryan goslings chest a 10it was the only constant in the film along with the prettiness of margot robbie,-0.2574,negative,True
797,tylerwfortenberry,26-Jul-23,spoilers sort ofbarbie is something most of us grew up around in some form of fashion whether we played with them with our sisters stole them when she wasnt looking or hated them and stuck to our hot wheels and gi joes in this instance barbie is not the same barbie we played with but a woman who is comfortable with complacency and is forced to fight the patriarchy while also find her purposefrom the set to the costumes barbie did a wonderful job of bringing us into the world of barbieland and reminding us of what the houses and cars used to look like and how she was just a little too big for everything sure there was some dialogue that was aloof and in need of some reworking and kens character was multi faceted  but nontheless it had a powerful two fold message to deliverbarbie is a film that has been so hyped up by the public and its duality of opening at the same time as oppenheimer that you cant help but want to see it to stay in the cultural loop at the same time barbie takes what should have been an entirely superficial script and goes just below the surface to remind us of our humanity the world we built and our opportunity for self determination personally i think this was a brilliant way to engage moviegoers and a great way to disembark from the surface level franchise films many of us are accustomed to watching its comedic and relevant quips and nods entertained while its double message challenged audiences to think critically about our world and their own places in itwhile i am not surprised by the out of place moments this is a hollywood movie after all i was pleasantly taken back by the journey we went on with stereotypical barbie and her discovery of what it means to have free will i highly suggest seeing this at least once and with your mom if you can,0.994,positive,True
800,jlnewps,26-Jul-23,i thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself most scenes last 12 minutes too long and the ending is terrible no resolve was ever made to the story which leaves we have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before politics aside this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess one positive is the set design and costumes were amazing the actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown but most jokes are over used or just fall flat,0.8339,positive,True
802,odontogmurillo,19-Aug-23,anyone who says the movie is good is undoubtedly a barbie fan it is a film with a poor script filled with a lot of padding sometimes somewhat absurd but which is necessary to be able to meet the duration of the film and nothing more the social representation of the main characters is disappointing belittling both the female and male gender on many occasions and with a slightly distorted conceptualization of common thinking in relation to the characters one or the other rescues the development of the film due to its trajectory on the big screen but nothing exceptional this is without a doubt a film that i would not see again on any given sunday while i rest even if im being honest its on my list of the worst movies ive seen in my last 15 years but be the witness yourself in short i can say that it is a film with great marketing management whose work team deserves a big applause,0.7848,positive,True
805,breathinglifehouse,23-Jul-23,went into this movie knowing itd be hilariously awkward robbie as barbie and gosling as ken also a great supporting cast including ferrell cena cera ferrera liu mckinnon just to name a few it was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism but thats to be expected when its a barbie movie this film had great costume and set designs and will win oscars for those two categories for sure it will most likely be nominated in all the major categories my only hope is that this destroys mission impossible at the box office so we can witness barbie defeating tom cruise worth a watch and probably a rewatch once it goes up for rent digitally,0.9434,positive,True
811,irnbondar,22-Jul-23,the movie did some real weird worldbuilding where none of the rules were consistent i had to keep reminding myself that barbieland was made by men therefore barbieland is not an exact opposite of the real world  its a rendering of what men think female utopia is but it wasnt a direct opposite of real world either i doubt many viewers will actually be able to internalize that as part of the lorethe parallel between realworld and barbieland just didnt make sense therefore it felt like a plot fail if barbies are all important unlike women in the real world where does ken swooning over barbie land on on that real world spectrumim just going to say the fact that barbie has 0 complex feelings until the lady from the real world played with her but ken was aware of being unhappy while being not a person but an accessory to barbie is the kind of double crossing i didnt expect i was confused about which point it tried provingryan gosling has a real chance to become an icon for incels after this performance he gets rejected creates an ultramasculine society and at the end barbie apologises to him and he rebrands he was a villain and did not get a redemption arc he shouldnt even be sentient in this universe as much as he is i expected barbie to be honest with him and say she just doesnt love him or that she wasnt made to have those feelings to him because matell did not give her those feelings instead she apologises for not giving him more attentionanyways it wasnt feminist enough for me it felt like it avoided some major issues of real life like the phrase we just learned how to hide it better that did not get addressed whatsoever like the barbies now know that women dont have it as great as them in the real world how does that solve anythingmaybe i am just reading too deep into a movie with flawed worldbuilding made for people who dont generally see the gender bias around them4 for some funny jokes but it could be funnier,0.8606,positive,True
813,cray87,16-Aug-23,yes barbie is the title of the movie but when watching it i increasingly feel like she is only playing the supporting role to ken in a weird wayken is kinda a simp but hes also the only one that has a proper story around him starting as a nobody then his whole personality changed when he got his redpilled moment got some musical songs to perform have a comradery moment with the other kens before it finally went back to normal it all made him a lot more human than barbie ever was in the filmthe weirdest thing in this movie though is that despite singing girl power and feminism it doesnt have likeable female characters outside of their good looks most of the females in this film are bland mean manipulative and somewhat narcissitic especially when the word perfect always getting brought up they dont even put in any scenes about the hardship of women outside of maybe the booty grabbing part which is done like a joke i wished they wouldve shown more of that instead of putting that in a speech and you get a female lead that doesnt even want change or do anything with it unless being pushed around there is no process around any of the achievements or struggles on the womens side just results in a form of speeches and short scenes,0.8792,positive,True
817,andygibbons-04493,13-Sep-23,barbie struggles to both identify and captivate the audience who is it written for whist there is one laugh out loud moments with sugar daddy barbie the movie seems too drawn out and drags at times despite having important themes about misogyny you cant help feel that a bit more subtlety would have got the message across whilst empowering the female characters and making them well rounded the male characters come across as macho stereotypes i was looking forward to seeing future doctor who ncuti gatwa but it was more of a blink and you will miss it rather than a message of equality you are left feeling this has a women are superior messageon a positive note though the movie is a great homage to the history of barbie and it is very much about spotting the discontinued barbie products it also shows young girls that they can be ambitious and anything is possible,0.9687,positive,True
821,kmataftsi,11-Aug-23,i dont understand all the hype around this movie i found it boring with almost no plot it had a few fun moments nothing too funny i dont think i ever laughed throughout the whole movie a great performance from ryan gosling indeed although margot robbie was perhaps mediocre he definitely stole the thunder regarding patriarchy and feminism it merely scratched the surface of those terms it was perhaps more of a simulation of how an elementary teacher would explain patriarchy to kids it doesnt offer anything to adults except for if they lived in a cave and never heard about patriarchy,0.817,positive,True
831,src7,21-Jul-23,i thought the movie was fantastic fun and a good time with a good message the acting was great the music the colors the cinematography story all a grade only 2 things really coulda been better and even with that i still highly recommend the movie2 things that could be better include first putting less silliness and more useful messaging around the corporate heads though this could also have saved the movie from getting too deep for some it could have been excited fun but more impactfulsecond if the ending wasnt just her going in the real world i wish barbie had a stronger ending as a character a much more eloquent speech on whats wrong and even highlight the issues we had in the real world trying to fix patriarchy think it would be stronger if barbie stayed in barbie world and fixed it and then if they wanted to set up for a possible second film she is visited in consult,0.9792,positive,True
834,rachaelparker-45170,23-Jul-23,i had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release however for me thats as good as it got brilliant marketing the first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just werent that touching i can see what they were trying to do with girlpower but i found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to put ken back in his place which i get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if youre trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power i would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real dream world looks like the speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film at least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through,0.9658,positive,True
835,milaradovanovic-65373,3-Sep-23,this movie moved me deeply i am a 20yearold girl and to finally see a movie that deals with gender inequality and patriarchy in such an intelligent way was something i really did not expect very satisfied hearing and seeing an acknowledgement of our current situation as a society was absolutely necessary during several scenes of the film i literally had tears in my eyes because i finally felt understood the message in my opinion is clearly expressed it is up to the viewer to perceive it anyone who thinks that the ending expresses the superiority of barbies over ken is missing the point they are completely off the mark not only womens issues are shown in the movie but also mens issues i highly recommend viewing also for men without prejudice and with the will to understand nothing more to add a masterpiece that deals with very topical social issues that we needed thank you barbie,0.9576,positive,True
836,denisnichita,23-Jul-23,the movie starts off well with a surprisingly clever and colorful depiction of barbies world she drinks out of empty cups showers under a waterless shower can fly around as if transported by a hand just a like a real doll house at some point barbie starts becoming a real woman by thinking about death having cellulite and her feet flatten out she goes into the real world to find the girl that broke the spacetime continuum and started to make her realall this time we see lots of barbies all of them named barbie that have advanced degrees are racially diverse with different body types even the kens are brainless bodybuilders who dont have any occupation other than being pretty and overly infatuated with the barbies ryan gosling does an excellent job and portrays ken perfectly which was surprising to me definitely an oscar performance for the actor also margot robbie is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking across the whole movie a true real life barbie doll who also plays the part perfectly we also have basically half the cast of sex education and lots of references to other movies like the matrix pinocchio and maybe others which i havent observedthis being said the problems start to pile up now cause all of the above is just a superficial sugar coating for the real reason of the movie gender theory propaganda the world is reduced to the patriarchy when barbie and ken go to the real world barbie feels objectified and powerless and ken starts understanding the patriarchy while the real world is a true patriarchy the barbie world is a true matriarchy long story short ken goes back to the barbie world establishes the patriarchy there and then barbie and her owner go back to the barbie world and reestablish the matriarchy the movie is blunt and frankly disappointing in its portrayal of men and women men are nothing women are everything men portrayed through ken dont have meaning and are not supposed to have meaning in life they just exist to be beaching and simp over barbies women on the other hand are everything lawyers teachers senators presidents phds scientists etci dare the audience to think of the barbie movie in reverse women are nothing and men are everything that would be an outrageous movies and the directors would be down right cancelledthe movie does not present the true condition of being a woman today but it just hates on men and wants them crushed and powerless in a sort of historical revenge it reduced the world and the complex social dynamics between men and women to patriarchy the movie its divisive destructive and does not solve any problems i honestly felt like i was in an orwell novel its a pitty because the set was very good and had a lot of potential for something deep and meaningful something that could have brought men and women together as a team but instead it resorted to sjw woke extreme left ideology and apparently the audience was brainlessly having it,0.9024,positive,True
844,benballard-73159,22-Jul-23,we can be surprised at the bold feminist narrative of this film which turned out to be a larger portion of the movie that most anticipated but we should all learn from it how urgent is an appreciation for women and their leadership if it takes a movie about literal toys in a fantasyland to see a female president barbie shows us what society would look like if women occupied all of the roles currently held by men which quickly illustrates the alarming lack of representation barbie points out the irony in laughing an allfemale supreme court when the united states supreme court for example was allmale for its first 191 years barbies achievements extend to business leadership nobel prizes and space travelthe film breaks down feminism for all ages and gender identities taking female empowerment to levels so basic that young children will immediately recognizes real inequalities in our world gerwig and the wonderful cast explore feminism through motherdaughter relationships the workplace and even generational differences through a touching portrayal of barbies founder ruth handlera host of lgbtq characters add to the strong community atmosphere of this film in addition to physically disabled characters and other marginalized barbies who effectively teach inclusion as a benchmark and not an ideal the film wastes no time pandering to those who take issue with the narrative and by doing so encourages women to unapologetically take up spacemattels willingness to confront the unrealistic body expectations and problematic pieces of barbies history headon seriously validates the message of this film and the importance of doing better because you know better cheers for barbie,0.9958,positive,True
849,teresa_wray,23-Jul-23,about reality none of the nonsense of ask the barbie movies in all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human it was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys it would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understandi told my human it was pretty much rocky horror picture show without the sexuality and way more pink not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time if it wasnt so new then i would do an episode on my podcast about it,0.9101,positive,True
850,lypasm,24-Jul-23,barbie movie had superb casting writing acting and plot twists it was a surprisingly cerebral movie with a poignant message on the perils of patriarchy in the real world and the exclusion of men in the barbie land at its heart barbie is a movie about selfdiscovery the movie is much more insightful than i expected and takes a deep dive into the perils of minimizing the humanity of women and men be it in barbie land or the real worldbarbie movie has some plot twists and it challenges stereotypes and preconceived notions of the roles of men and women in society barbie doesnt want to be put in a box in the real world and ken wants to have value and a meaningfully existence in barbie land,0.8952,positive,True
851,stuartroberts-61491,23-Jul-23,barbie 2023barbie 2023 is a clever political comedy instilled with scenes of artfullyemployed and oftentouching drama and rife with thinly albeit comedically veiled commentaries on the woes and whims of patriarchal society neofeminism republicanism and surprisingly given the films main overarching themes democrat beliefs at a runtime of 1h 54m the film was fantastic i thoroughly enjoyed my viewing particularly due to the performances of one of the strongest casts ive seen in any film released this year with robbie as barbie gosling as beach ken ferrel my favourite performance of the movie as the mattel ceo mckinnon as weird barbie and cera as alan amongst others serving the films witty multifaceted writing well each person felt perfect for their role and i dont personally think it could have been cast any better it was perfectspoilers from here on outthe story is simple but well executed and easily palatable for a range of ages largely in thanks to the nearscintillating writing of gerwig and baumbach and the clever concealment of political messages such that they either fit in well with the story and serve pivotally to the plot ken introducing the patriarchy to the other kens in barbie land or as it becomes kendom or are placed into a scene in which they cause no hindrance or clunkiness and simply convey a message ferrels character much like his president business in the lego movie wears an outfit analogous to that of donald trump and kens whole newlyinstated patriarchy is certainly designed to mimic many republican beliefs along with perpetuating stereotypes like gorging on beers by day and engaging in superficial traditionalisms horses the comedy is by all accounts really funny multiple gags persist throughout like the discontinuation of pregnant barbie the lack of genitalia on barbies and kens weird barbie mckinnon and the callowness of the mattel executives there are great oneoff jokes too and many are clearly intended to cater towards adults as well as children like when barbie sees a billboard for the miss universe beauty pageant on the venice boardwalk coming to the conclusion that they must be the supreme court most political entities are conventionally attractive females in barbie land depressed barbie along with other barbies playing off bodyimage stereotypes and a surprising innuendo spoken by ferrels character in which with no real context he refers to the mattel hq as a long phallic building overall the film is very funny and knows when to and when not to employ comedy in a scene for the best effectthe pacing is tight for the first half and it manages to maintain good overall pace throughout slowing slightly towards the end but still moving along nicely up until the credits rollnow the characters i cant lie there is not a lot to say and thats not a bad thing each performance is marvellous thanks largely in part to great casting but for me the characters didnt evolve all that much over the films runtime sure barbie ends up a human and gains genitalia somehow implied by the final scene ken becomes slightly more selfaware i guess the mattel execs just sortof sway freely between barbieperpetuated matriarchyproponents and selfabsorbed blatant sexists and weird barbie becomes deostracized but apart from that the rest serve as vessels for the films message simple and entertaining but devoid of complexity one character alan played by cera did catch my attention though ill talk about him more in my criticisms down below another great thing i noticed was the movies drama i was actually surprised prior to watching when i read via google that its genres were comedydrama and upon watching was pleasantly surprised the film includes a few rather touching scenes satisfying enough not to dull the tone but serious enough to have impact on the viewer and arent plagued by cringy music nor excessive jokes they are raw by all accounts one such scene features barbie sat on a public bench shortly after realising that the world is not a matriarchal haven like barbie land as she cries in a cowgirloutfit noless she notices an older woman sat across from her and tearily declares her beautiful playing on the films themes of existence ageing and impending mortality it serves as the heart of the movie and was onpar with something one may expect to find in a more serious drama another includes barbies meeting with ruth handlers ghost in the mattel headoffice which is later complimented by another which is laden with innocuous jokes about ruths taxevasion scandals and holds a more comedic tonenow earlier i praised the films use of veiled political undertones but i also believe there were some that didnt quite work firstly i am not sure what message the film was actually pedalling it certainly wasnt feminism as many seem to think sure many scenes involve strong women demonized men we dont all catcall sexually harass or otherwise dominate women in our daily lives and a somewhat functional matriarchy only functional for the women but the film also seems pretty critical of neofeminist beliefs and ideals it quite blatantly criticises the matriarchy in that all of the men are oppressed and exist only to fawn over the women who dont want them and shows that nonconventional barbies weird barbie are ostracized and bullied for deformities which they cant help though it also criticises the patriarchy in that nearly every man in the movie sexually objectifies women to the degree of fetishising them by putting them in skimpy maid outfits the women that support the patriarchy are all brainwashed and must be reprogrammed in order to have them rebel and that the patriarchs are all somewhat stupid or callow what was the aimelsewise the republicans are certainly minced throughout donald trump symbology criticism of traditionalist ideals and the emphasis on castdiversity certainly sees to this the cast has multiple black people latinamericans and a lesbian in kate mckinnon amongst other represented minorities though the character i mentioned earlier alan seems to criticise those who are democrats leftwing works in that he is ostracized by the kens largely ignored by the barbies and seeks to escape stating that noone will care if an alan gets into the real world he is one of those no other character likes them characters and overall manages to throw the films message into disarray there is no steadfast discernable message as far as i can see and all agendae are both furthered and criticised with none that stick as in the end barbie land is still ruled matriarchally and the kens are still held in lower esteem by the barbies though the real world is unchanged and mattel shows no signs of incorporating female leadership furthermore the kens never seem to gain any purpose which was their whole goal as far as i can tell they get no dreamhouses no equality no horses no jobs and no love 3 this didnt ruin the film for me by any means and i still herald it as the best one ive watched this year so far i am to watch oppenheimer soon but it does make me wonder what gerwig and baumbach really had in mindoverall the film was great and i would recommend it for all as long as they can take a joke dont hate women dont hate men and arent perturbed by politics it is witty fun touching and hilarious sated with fantastic performances and easily palatable characters i give this film an 810 and will definitely watch it again,0.9996,positive,True
856,jaimeematheson,23-Jul-23,i expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones it ended up being insanely funny ridiculous fun and stupidly entertaining yet highly topical and commentative this movie hit on so many topics patriarchy capitalism feminism even misandry yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout it never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations the only reason i dont give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavyhanded and i can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message other than that this is the best movie ive seen in years and i cant see any topping it any time soon,0.9117,positive,True
857,petrxpp,23-Jul-23,going to the cinema is a waste of money if you just not want only watch margot barbie certainly had the potential for an original and fresh adventure musical but alas unfortunately even wellchosen actors wellwritten songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenarioa mess of banal clichs and a completely wasted opportunity with such a budget a cast and an interesting iconic toy it should have been handled betterthe film has a very interesting and brisk first half but from the second it drags on at a disgusting paceeven worse is the completely inappropriate overblown and absurd push towards feminism,-0.9067,negative,True

863,collectionofatoms,31-Jul-23,i never would have gone to see this movie if it werent for a friend showing up to a party and telling me that it was a masterpiece she described it as high art which to me is high praise after seeing it i agree it has all of the qualities of high art in that it is bound to be confusing to some interpreted differently and will inspire great feelings positive and negative depending on the viewerbarbie gives you every opportunity to come in thinking you will be getting the silly quirky female equivalent of the marvel universe vapid problems absurdity boys and a classical formulaic movie arc and it some ways it does keep to thatbut all of those things are overshadowed by the philosophical discussion taking place the director shows two worlds in juxtaposition the barbie universe and the real world in present day matriarchy and patriarchyby removing a sense of consequence from the lives and decisions of the characters from the barbie universe it instead is able to engage on the philosophical level a good comparison is the good place characters dont have to act or respond realistically instead characters respond thoughtfully and in accordance with the philosophical archetypes they representthe barbie universe is made to be perfect for the women that run that society the kens are riddled with need for validation they hold no power of their own and barbies have no incentive to share itthrough some plot vehicles barbie and ken come to the real world in one of the most important scenes of the film barbie and ken walk down venice beach arriving from their strange plastic universe for the first time the ultimately empowered barbie is ogled and catcalled and made to feel unsafe and the ultimately disempowered ken is made to feel respected just for being alivei think this specific scene is really important because its at the center of understanding the context for modern feminism the simple difference between navigating walking down the street as a woman vs a man our world feels qualitatively different depending on who we are our feelings of safety and security in the public can differ wildly depending on what body we inhabitcheekily the film is made for the female gaze all men in the film are shown as being vapid and thoughtless both in the barbie universe and the real world i feel that this was an intentional decision to cause feelings of discomfort in men that watch it serves to both flip the standard movie script that has been improving in recent years where it has been normal for female characters to be accessories to a plot and eyecandy for the male viewer and not ends in themselves and also to make similarities between male viewers and ken sting a bit as a male viewer and musician i felt a painful twinge when ken says let me play music at you it caused me to wonder how much space i take up socially with my music and aware of how playing music when its not expressly desired can have a way of shutting down vulnerable conversation similarly the depictions of male to male empowerment felt familiar caricatures with a grain of truth to themas the conflict ends and barbie world returns to matriarchy the film ends on a thoughtful tone in both worlds the subjugated sex needs to fight for power being ungenerously allotted to them by the ruling sex with a clear message that nobody wants either of these worlds that in discarding the feelings of the unempowered denizens of our world we create a weak foundation that true acceptance and understanding of these issues comes from letting in our full mortal nature and the realities that come with being human that being messy complex and sexual beings is what gives meaning to this world and what is called for in any conversation on equality and class disparitydespite our expectations barbie isnt dumb it reflects a lot of thought and understanding of the current moment it uses archetypes and simple forms to discuss real issues in the zeitgeist today it discusses the problems with barbie as a brand with some formulations of feminism with patriarchical society and what is does to womens understandings of themselvesbarbie represents an awareness that far surpasses anybodys expectations of the intellectual property it represents and is worth the uncomfortable and somewhat depressing nature of the film for the dialog it opens up,0.9909,positive,True
864,louis-20683,20-Aug-23,the discussion surrounding the barbie movie has generated varying viewpoints with some reviewers suggesting that the film is critical of men portraying them as weak and insecure however upon closer examination it becomes evident that the movie offers a sophisticated commentary on broader societal dynamics encompassing power dynamics oppression and gender rolesto begin with the movie underscores that patriarchy as a structural framework doesnt uniformly favour all men this is exemplified by ken whose lack of opportunities becomes apparent in the context of the real world contrary to the idea that patriarchy inherently benefits all men the film sheds light on how this system works to elevates those who already have wealth and authority within society in essence it unveils that a genuine world where patriarchy benefits all men albeit an unlikely scenario could only exist in a world where conventional rules and responsibilities dont exist barbieland while simultaneously presenting us with an already failing matriarchy that oppresses mena key theme that emerges is the portrayal of oppression as a learned behaviour kens exploration into patriarchy serves as a catalyst for his evolution the display of toxic masculinity he develops is rooted in the adoption of traits he observes in an attempt to gain respect and power it becomes clear however that this faade doesnt genuinely resonate with him as a person in the final moments of the movie ken rejects the ideas and behaviours he initially believed to be powerful realising that they neither align with who he is as a person or make him feel fulfilled this underscores how societal expectations often make men feel pressured into conforming to behaviours within a system that in reality fails to serve their genuine intereststhere is a clear narrative in the last 20 minutes of the movie to show that most men while being aware of patriarchy arent actively trying to oppress women which is really clear when ken says he thought it was just about riding horses this highlights how many men while aware of patriarchy dont actively try to oppress women instead sticking to the status quo comes from a fear of challenging the existing power structures out of fear of losing power or falling into the same state of oppression they were forcing on womenultimately the core message of the movie is to advocate for an equitable world that doesnt support the dominance of men or women the film suggests that power does not need be gained through oppression instead it shows that the best solution lies in an world where everyone has equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations this is symbolised by kens transformation into an authentic version of himself shedding the confines of the beach ken stereotype similarly stereotypical barbie is portrayed as lacking resonance with genuine womanhood in essence the film advocates for a world where individuality flourishes irrespective of gender and where empowerment is rooted in authenticity rather than conforming to the roles society puts on usto summarise the barbie movie is more than its surface interpretations and works to show an exploration of power dynamics oppression and societal roles its portrayal of characters and their transformations serves as a mirror to the complexity of realworld issues ultimately advocating for a society where real empowerment stems from embracing individuality and fostering equal opportunities for allto people who think the barbie movie casts a negative light on men and depicts them as weak its important to recognise that the films intention is not to generalise or demean masculinity just as much as it works to dismantle toxic elements of femininity while certain aspects of the movie might seem critical of traditional gender roles its deeper message speaks the complexities of power dynamics and societal expectations that affect everyone the movies portrayal of characters like ken undergoing transformation and introspection is not about condemning masculinity but rather an exploration of the pressures society places on individuals to conform to predefined roles by engaging with the film in this broader context it becomes evident that it aims to foster understanding and empathy rather than to vilify masculinity as a whole,0.6558,positive,True
866,penguinmizeravi,11-Aug-23,the barbie movie interested me at first i wasnt expecting anything more than a silly movie with an interesting message maybe it couldve been a great way to show people the struggles of women in modern society however this movie really disappointshonestly i was enjoying this picture very much around the first act some jokes were landing it was silly but it seemed to have no wish of making a statement barbieland seemed very far from reality and thats what made it funny ken getting flown by the waves in the most unnatural way just because he wants to prove himself also his job is beach i found that very funnyhowever i was expecting the real world to be a turning point in the movie if the real world actually seemed tonally different from barbieland or even seem real in any way characters like will ferrells ceo of mattel and the employees just make the real world feel as silly and dumb as barbieland though will ferrell is hilarious in this moviehowever i would let that one slide if it wasnt for other characters that feel dumb and just dumb not funny like sasha who is a completely useless character that was introduced as this mean depressed teenager that wants to harm everyone for no reason however she never again is presented this way somehow she is a nice girl later in the movie and even defends her mom in the rare instances of her actually saying something in the second to third act of the movie her mom though has a more important role however she is one of the big elements that ruin this movie her speech near the end of the second act feels like shes stating the obvious and not really making a difference however for some reason everyone buys it and barbie no longer has depression it looks like greta has no clue how to express depression on screenbarbie tries to create emotional moments in a couple of scenes and in the very ending which feel totally out of tone as i feel like margots character really doesnt have much depth and these scenes are dropped in the worst times and are not impactful it looks like greta has no clue how to express depression on screen as some moments that couldve been sad are treated as jokeswhen ken figures out about patriarchy and goes back to barbieland is where this movie shows what its true message is the kens end up ruling barbieland and all the barbies get mindcontrolled except for margot but then the day is saved as all the barbies take control of barbieland once again and the kens remain with no power whatsoever i see this as gretas moment of telling the audience that this movie is not for men or she just truly believes men should shut up and let women do what they will as equality truly is never a goal in this movieas the narrator says one day the kens will have the same rights as women in the real world i noticed the hatred coming along if barbieland symbolizes something it would be an utopia the perfect society however instead of solving the problem of this utopia by giving power to kens and creating a true perfect balance it comes back to statusquo by keeping kens powerless showing gretas real wish here i feel its a huge mistake as the movie brings up the topic of change halfway through while not making a good example contradicting its own morals if they were correct in the first placebarbies character arc is not bad but its poorly executed it seems like its all over the place and the writers didnt know how to develop her sometimes she is annoying oftentimes she is dumb but mostly her arc is based on her depression and how she feels though we dont really feel like her and i get confused on how the depressed doll thing works im really confused as no other depressed person ever played with a doll before it seems like children are seen as dull and have no emotions that matter because if the dolls reflect their personality then they would be dumb and never question reality as the barbies and kens do but barbie is the only one that does and this is why she turns into a human in the end its not a very emotional ending it feels overly dramatic as the topics being covered and the tone of the movie doesnt build up to this moment but barbie now living in the real world is fine it just isnt anything specialoverall this movie instigates hatred and is doing this at this very moment in real life the polarizing nature of this movie is clear here its lack of selfdoubt and the need of proving itself correctly while not being right whatsoever makes us who didnt enjoy the movie turn into the villains as our opinion becomes irrelevant and can be refuted with simply i bet your favorite movie is the godfather im not trying to pick any side as im just giving my opinion i respect all opinions and expect people to do the samethis movie could be fine in its own right if it wasnt for the toxic and sheer irrational nature that it generates which is a reflection of our society and the hatred we keep inside and often only let it out in movies such as this one though im looking forward to more new ideas like this one as the industry is starting to come back with inventive and creative pictures that bring people to the cinema and generate revenue just hoping to be better movies next time barbie2023 310,-0.9931,negative,True
870,verawik,31-Jul-23,at first i had no interests in watching this movie but my friends dragged me along i do not regret using 1 hour and 54 minutes of my life on this moviespoileralertthe filmmakers are luring us in with great actors and comedy and then we get the real message hidden behind all that barbies world is gender opposite from the real world here are all barbies winners leaders and the important they are main characters in life and in the movie in the real world its mostly men instead the kens men are presented as stupid sexy and not so important characters just they way women mostly are presented as in the most movies as in the real world when women realize how the difference in gender views affect their life they take action the kens does that in movie too the kens went overboard and did not hesitate to downgrade the barbies to sexy women who only can grab a beer for them and even took their homes positions and jobs the barbie movie are really about genders and showing us a world where the gender roles and vision are completely switched the kens are the women of real worldi think barbie is an legendary movie who really shows how many women experience the world and as every comedy it is a hidden message there but in barbie it is much stronger so for some people who dont enjoy lessons the movie is might not for you but for thoose who are open minded and enjoy something new this is the movie for youthe only thing i did not enjoy about the movie is that the leaders in the board of barbie organization was made way too stupid it would actually be better if they were in normal intelligence state ofc with normal intelligence they would still try to make barbie go in the box and not think too much about ken on the loose,0.99,positive,True
872,MovieWatcher22,7-Aug-23,i had high expectations as a result of the media press however these were crushed from the startfirst of all i did expect it to feel a little generic and cheesy although all i could feel throughout the movie is that it was rushed and cheap the storyline was dry and overpoliticalid have liked to see more lgbtq representation and breaking stereotypes as it felt like just a generic film even the barbies were considered stereotypescomedy throughout was limited and wasnt engaging at all  sometimes trying too hard to emphasise feminism and going too far in the opposite direction to the world is heading in im not encouraging patriarchyhowever i did find the music quite good especially the billie eilish song and did redeem the movie a little bitin summary the movie was mediocre at best and theres not much to discuss it felt like a cheap version of movies like spirited and the greatest showman with no real emotion,0.9198,positive,True
874,cssledge-86415,21-Jul-23,i really enjoyed the satirical approach that was employed in barbie it poked fun at barbie world but also delivers a message of empowerment and individuality i laughed and was throughly entertained its a great movie for mothers and their tween teen or adult daughtersi would recommend this movie to anyone that played with barbies and kens it explored and poked fun at all aspects of the barbie universe mattel barbies perfect life and appreance barbies many professions kens dependency on barbie patriarchy feminism barbie and kens clothes their houses cars their fake food pools water beaches what happens to dolls that get mistreated its a great movie well done,0.9903,positive,True

887,leifage,26-Aug-23,im one of those but i have many others in my life who i work with and live with and so it was great to view the world through their eyes for a couple hours and get my head around issues that impact them it was a funny and entertaining movie just go to it aware that theres quite a bit of sociological dialogue america ferreras soliloquy in the middle of the movie was powerful and would have been imo more powerful if it hadnt been surrounded by so many others like it before and after but the issues are complex and could not possibly be covered by just one scene so thats understandable it feels good to be heard and theres a lot to hear here but nothing for men to fear the one thing i did not like was when one male character admitted that we men do a better job hiding the patriarchy in modern times cmon has there been progress or not that statement creates distrust and erases good will theres been progress yay we need more progress okay lets go,0.9926,positive,True
892,rnucci,1-Aug-23,i agree that the film is contrary to the feminist narrative so much so that in barbieland women rule everything and barbie didnt want to stay there at the end of the movie preferring real life the men of barbilndia built by women were useless and bananas without an i this is dealt with in one of the final scenesi thought the film brought up very deep reflections that people didnt understand according to the film the world of patriarchy is imperfect and so is the feminist worldthe scenes of ken declaring himself to barbie are reminiscent of poets and their muses at no point does he make an apology for ideologythe film is intelligent with impeccable performances,-0.2076,negative,True
895,stepschiff,26-Jul-23,at the beginning of the film barbieworld is run by women barbies which reflects the real life barbie dolls that have all sorts of jobs like doctor scientist etcat the end of the film the barbies realise that matriarchy is wrong by getting a taste of their own medicine and so men kens in barbieworld start being allowed to have jobs and positions of power alongside the womenthis is why the barbie movie is a film about true gender equality heavy handed like many popular hollywood films but great message anyone who doesnt believe that barbie isnt a multifaceted woman hasnt been paying attention for the past few decades silly billies,0.8765,positive,True
896,drawdycole,23-Jul-23,"in a fun visually stunning simplistic way barbie captures the audience with nostalgia and bright color schemes with a plethora of barbie styles versions and callouts to real accessories barbie proves to peak the interest of the audience and bring humor with short quips and comments by the characters and narrator it has a strong opening that establishes the makebelieve world and sets a quick witted tone to the movie mixing slap stick comedy with deeper philosophical undertoneshowever after establishing main character
barbie and sidekick ken characters well and showing a clear direction in the first quarter of the film humor is exchanged for harsh reality in the second quarter with no real relief or solution given to the audience as the movie moves into the third quarter mixed messaging seems to have feminist roots but fails to address real issues for the common moderate feminist there are several chances in the film in which the main character barbie can and does acknowledge the imbalance between men and women but fails to provide a bonding peaceful solution to the imbalance furthermore it doubles down on the more radical one sided views of modern feminism aiming to make one gender men incompetent while promoting the other gender women as the best leadership solution for a competently run balanced society at one point a main character other than barbie has a minutes long soliloquy outlining all the troubles of women today yet solutions are never presented and the end result feels more like complaining than empowermentthe last fourth of the movie seems to complete the fall away from the light heartedness of the opening which was actually one of the strengths and expectations of the film slap stick awkward one liner comedy remains throughout but while watching the audiences confusion about the message only allows for chuckles instead of all out laughs some comedy ends up falling flat from obvious missed payoffs or opportunities to instill the uniting of genders as a solution instead the film awkwardly seems to support the notion that one sided governance is acceptable as long as it is the side that the writers deem proper in this case it is clearly women but almost coldly so as if leaving out the core feminist movement completely if barbie was meant to leave the audience with a feeling of hope for the future it certainly missed the mark onthenose propaganda was not what the audience came to see but is what they received regardless of how humorous any scene attempted to bethe best aspect of the movie are convincing performances by margot robbie and ryan gosling robbies portrayal of barbie is well over shadowed or more accurately over powered by goslings ken unfortunately the character arc for barbie was completed but underwhelming while the character arc for ken was expansive but confusing both characters seemed to miss the moral growth mark leaving the audience wondering if any lessons had been learned at allin summary strong visual presence humor and performances kept this film from being a total flop due to the over exaggerated and misguided social commentary forced on the viewer what should have been a light hearted fun uniting feelgood film was indeed a well put together visually stunning mildly funny piece of propaganda for mattel playing dress up in a modern feminist costume that only a barbie doll could get away with",0.9969,positive,True
902,pzcxfbnh,26-Jul-23,whenever someone says they disliked the movie most people tell them its because they are not getting the plot correctly or they simply dont get feminism i am a girl and a feminist and this movie was all marketing ik im not saying something new it was a cute story but half of the dialogues were badkinda cringy also many relationships were presented to us for example the mom and her daughter and the movie never bothered to show us a little backstory it had potential at least i really appreciated that the main purpose of the movie was to show women everyday struggles loved the monologuei think its a nice movie but not worth the hype like to watch it in the cinema,0.948,positive,True
908,mjquinonez,5-Oct-23,barbie live actionbarbie live action stars margot robbie ryan gosling and directed by greta gerwig it premiered this year and tells us the dynamics of the imaginary world of barbies and kens with the gender roles reversed in this pink worldwhen she was younger she loved barbie i became involved in that fantasy world created by a woman without losing everything that characterized femininity through her appearance her characteristic outfits her makeup and the multifaceted talents she had added to this barbie crossed that cinematic world and it was possible for us to build our own identity through a doll all these characteristics and more were accompanied by her identifying phrase you can be whatever you want to be for this reason barbie was and is an icon in the childhood of many however not everything is rosy in the world of barbie and the live action of the film shows us thisthe film transports us to this imaginary world that we all created and that we were finally able to see in reality i love the satire that accompanies this film about how mattel the company that created the doll is made up of men who according to them recognize the needs and demands of girls barbie also shows us that these demands are diverse and that each girl creates a different world with each doll she uses this is how we meet the president barbie the physicist the diplomat the doctor the writer and many others but finally it focuses on the stereotypical barbiethrough stereotypical barbie we feel involved in the complexities of the female stereotype identity crises and patriarchal oppression this happens when this barbie and ken go to the real world and face the terrible news of the true influence that barbie has had on the lives of girls it is interesting to see how the character played by margot robbie questions her identity and what she reflects to others while ken tries to implement that macho world that she observes in reality in the pink world of barbiethis is how the film revolves around this gender struggle between the kens and the barbies to implement their ideal world finally the barbies regain control of their reality however the stereotypical barbie decides to take on the challenge of being human and face the oppressive reality that the real world representsfinally it is very easy as women to feel identified with what is exposed in the film however barbie falls short in representing the problems suffered by nonwhite and nonnorth american women barbie is a feminist film clearly but white feminism is not something that all women identify with,0.9141,positive,True
910,lassewoebken,31-Oct-23,"for me the song im just ken was the best part of the movie but the whole movie is great its a great mix of comedy and some serious topics like gender equality with a deeper message  
it shows the problems that all women still have in society but also the problems of the men which is good because i have the feeling that due to the fact that men are paid better and had more rights the society is more focused on the problems of the women in this wolrd and forgets about the mens problems but this movie perfectly shows us that both genders have problems in this unfair world greta gerwig really coocked here",0.9592,positive,True
917,raschi-cs,27-Aug-23,the jokes are entertaining and the movie has the just correct amount of dramatic storyline to make it more than an empty comedythe repetitive use of patriarchy is rather in the movie because it to wants to make sure that everyone understands the message and not because it thinks men  bad and woman  good already after the first 30 minutes the message is super clear and thats where it gets a bit empty it fights so much against stereotypical masculinity consumerism and capitalism but still puts a 4 minutes long chevrolet commercial which screams how rugged the brand is in the movie that entirely destroys the credibility of the movie,-0.7485,negative,True
923,sanashakib,23-Jul-23,"if ur over 13 this movie will most definitely bore you the movie tried so hard to make a point yet still failedthe cast was amazing but the plot didnt do much
i see how the writers tried to make the movie show us the double standards when it comes to woman rights but honestly they did such a bad job at that i really hoped this movie would actually be as meaningful as the writers intended it to be but it was just a very bad comedya very bad representation of woman and just overall a bad movieit could be fun for passing time and for girls night but dont expect to be amazed by itcause you will be disappointed",-0.6328,negative,True
924,maeshamahmud,26-Jul-23,this movie did a lot of things good and a lot of things badit left me from the theater feeling more emotions than oppenheimer those emotions being anger and frustrationthe movie was aesthetically very precise in the way that it felt like they had a specific vision for it it reminded me a bit of what toy story would look like in live action it leave the audience ponder over the significance of the movie which i have heard a lot there were a lot of moments where the film was heading in the right direction but i felt they havent fully explored those ideas it felt like a waste potential when barbie goes into the real world and sees how women are supposedly treated this is no new concept and feels a bit exaggerate and not addressing the real challenges women face in society i feel we have pass ahead of what was being portrayed the monologue with the mother to the barbies did feel relatable and wish those concepts were explored a bit more than just being repeated againwhen ken brings back patriarchy to barbieland and the barbies take it back by manipulating and tricking the kens felt very cheap what was the message behind that at the end of the movie nothing changed barbie did become a fascist and took over barbieland and were back to square one maybe that was the message that nothing will ever change the ken are to barbieland what women are to the real worldexcept for stereotypical barbie having thoughts of death and cellulite that plotline was then abandoned and never mentioned all the barbies were supposedly perfect and didnt have any flaws which is the point but if you want to portray realistic women why did all the barbies at the end became the same as before there was no progress done there was only weird barbie that felt human since it has bad and good characteristics but it felt like she was only a tour guide than an actual characterperhaps thats the message of the movie that there can be no progress which this movie was really good at getting conversations started since there are so many mixed opinionsthis whole movie also felt like a whole 2hours long commercial on barbie the whole marketing campaign made it feel like you fell in the trap of what this movie was trying to avoid capitalism consumerist society yet the sells for barbie will increasethe monologue with barbie and the creator felt forced like those motivational speeches trying to force the message to the audience instead of thinking and coming to that conclusionthere were more than a few awkward moments that didnt need to be in the movie that felt unnecessarythe casting for barbie was spot on but i would not agree for ken it didnt make sense for ryan gosling to be ken although no complain from the acting obviously but just didnt fit the hair looked awkward and distracting and wasnt a portrayal of the youth kenat the end i think its also a huge generalization and dont know if this is the right movie for feminism and equality i expected more from this movie,-0.9374,negative,True
927,bcbcqt,23-Jul-23,while the barbie movie delivers a range of colorful and diverse visuals casting and thematic concepts it just fell short for me in the way of substance and execution leaving me wanting morethe physical makeup of the barbie movie is most definitely a strong suit within the film the set pieces environments and outfits are all adequately colorful visually pleasing and reminiscent of early 90s to 00s barbie marketing the colorful cast of both recognizable and lesser known actors creates a diverse character list which is relatively cohesive with the overall plots the character designs feel unique and refreshing while also remaining recognizable throughout the sets and props feel whimsical and fun while also providing purpose and interesting context they honestly created barbieland perfectly and are able to include clever visual jokes and references however it can occasionally feel a little random or on the nose like theyre just waiting for middle aged women in the audience to go oh my god i had that when i was a kid its barbie marketing genius but it may get old after some time however barbies plot this is where barbie fell short for me it feels like directors of the movie spent a significant amount of time shoveling money into the visuals and immense amount of marketing for this movie and with three months left they scrambled to put together a plot for the cast and set pieces there are multiple plots strung together very loosely that feel disjointed because of this none of the thematic concepts are explored adequately and its difficult to feel much of anything for any one of the characters character development happens very quickly and anytime we think were going to receive a more complex character their facade melts and they are revealed to be a relatively one sided representation of a specific idea or character role barbie the naive stereotypical perfectionist who developed depth after very quickly coming to terms with change and her own mortality ken the weak insecure man reliant on a woman who develops a sigma facade to stick it to the women controlling his life  but in actuality he is wounded from her rejection the mother shes a mom she has a teenage daughter who she has trouble connecting with where have i heard this before the daughter a onesided representation of a woke teenager whos angst is never explored outside of shes just a moody teenager  despite this it is still an integral plot line that is never developed we are never shown the daughters transition or possible trauma leading to her developing hatred for her extremely caring and loving parents all of this is constantly being shoved down our throats none of the character development or themes are very subtle instead opting for explicit mentions of gender roles patriarchy fascism political correctness and aloof representations of men in power while these are all great concepts to explore they are all tackled simultaneously and thus executed poorly in an attempt to avoid confusion i assume these concepts are constantly and directly shown to audience members  even with ken literally learning the definition of a patriarchy in the library and having that be his motivator for the rest of the film this easily victimizes women and strips male characters of any and all complexity  reducing them to caricaturas lacking any real substance there were a few times where the cinematography gave the plot a moment of fresh air adding scenic and thematic complexity such as when barbie first looks around in the real world and sees others experiencing human emotion before accepting the duality of happiness and pain as a part of organic psychology however these moments are often overshadowed by reverting character arcs or other themes deemed to momentarily be more important all in all barbie offers a fun story attempting introspection in multiple parts but falls short in its execution of those deeper concepts and ideas instead opting for cinematic multitasking of the highest degree many scenes dont make very much sense or contribute to the plot but it does still offer a nostalgic exploration of childhood growing up and humanity admittedly it does have a pretty great soundtrack billies song may have brought a tear to my eye despite me not caring about barbies sudden want to become human but thats because of that falsetto wow  and ice spice and nikis rendition of aquas barbie girl had both me and my boyfriend wanting to buss a move out of the theatre,0.9887,positive,True
928,gyubastian,7-Aug-23,this movie makes us think what kind of story would create the direct interaction between barbie and human beings so unique and i could not guess where we were going the graphic is cheerful with the value of feminism and patriarchy a spirit of selfidentity and about passion i dont think children should watch this some jokes were sarcastic yet funny for those who understand it children might find this movie exciting but maybe find difficulties in some parts of iti still can say it is worth watching but i didnt find extraordinary things in it as a fan of barbie i still like the movie but yeah i dont think i would like to rewatch it again i love the actors and actresses they were amazing,0.9858,positive,True

barbie is an objectively good movie when you consider its aspects as a film the set design is amazing in the barbie world and this combined with the amazing wardrobe really makes you feel like this world actually could exist these two things are a real standout for me and is everything you could hope for from a barbie movie margot robbie and ryan gosling play an amazing barbie and ken something i did not expect was how much i liked michael ceras performance as allan i feel like his performance gave the film as sense of awkward relief which i enjoyed although i touch on why i really didnt like the storytelling aspect of barbie in the negatives section i do like how the film builds this metaphor between the relationship of barbies and kens and the relationship of men and womennegatives
barbie is movie where you are not allowed to think for yourself one of my favorite aspects about storytelling is its ability to communicate a message in disarming ways the type of movie where you buy into the message either implicitly or explicitly through exposition of the characters struggles movies that forgo this buy in from the audience are more or less just preaching an idea rather than trying to convince or demonstrate an idea this is really where i have problems with the barbie movie while the causes pushed for in the movie are noble they are so inelegant and on the nose it really does feel like you are being talked at through the entire movie i cannot tell you a single theme subtext or message that the movie was trying to convey that wasnt also explicitly conveyed in dialogue between the characters consider something like the dialogue between barbie and ken after the barbies stopped the kens from changing the constitution after ken returned from the human world with his new idea of patriarchy in this dialogue is the only way to convey the idea of not defining your self worth based on others andor your material possessions is by barbie saying almost exactly that but in not so few words are the characters so superficial that any attempt to demonstrate that point through self reflection andor actions would just completely fall flat this is not an isolate incident either i would challenge anybody to find either a theme subtext or any socialpolitical statement that they movie tries to convey that isnt in some dialogue somewhere where it is almost explicitly stated as such this issue really makes the movie feel shallow and superficial and uninteresting to watch after a certain point",0.9788,positive,True
933,postaattila,5-Aug-23,the film goes around feminism and such its message is quite good and i agree with it but the movie itself is the worst movie i have ever seen its made for like 2 years olds but with expressions that only adults van understand it was painful to sit through the two hours play time because nothing really happened and every caracter was annoying not just annoying but also very simple it seemed like noone had any brain they are talking to everyone like you would talk to a two year oldthere isnt really a plot to follow just two straight hours of whining and nervewracking dialogesfor the love of god dont watch this movie it takes away two hours of you lifeafter the movie everyone i could hear including girls was saying that this was waaaaay worse than anyone expected so please spare yourself,0.9156,positive,True
937,iyaseminkose,23-Jul-23,im not a barbie girl in not the barbie world life in plastic its not fantastic in the beginning of the film it can be thought that will go nice way with a good end and a powerful message there is so much effort in the beginning like building a strong idea however this is disappered in the final and this is such a disappointment that the film does nothing about giving an idea about liberal feminism because there is always managers as boys or girls i think the films main idea should be every human being no matter it is a boy or a girl can be everything they want and can be handle every situation as a human it is ridiculous to discuss this as being a man or a woman in the 2023 in the barbie world or in the real world it should be out of date the final should be reviewed with this manner cause the expactation was very high with this hugebudget film,0.5812,positive,True
940,mary_blondie,8-Aug-23,for sure it failed to achieve feminism or be a criticism to patriarchy but what to expect from barbie and mattel unfortunately in my opinion the movie did the exact opposite thing setting the standards and the stereotypes for women in a non realistic level although margot robbie was delightful to watch very classy and beautiful perfectly representing barbie the general movie vibe could be a lot more fun so as to have a meaning watching it it should last 30 minutes less in duration and doesnt worth the hype i am glad i saw it so as to have an opinion but it is nothing more that a typical light meaningless movie,0.9736,positive,True
