1,LoveofLegacy,21-Jul-23,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man im a woman in my 20s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,0.957,positive
2,aherdofbeautifulwildponies,26-Jul-23,before making barbie 2023greta gerwigsinglehandedly directed two filmslady bird 2017andlittle women 2019 both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence both had nuanced and layered portrayals of motherdaughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue both were very very good given those credentials one may expect barbie to be as intelligent convincing and amusing a picture  and well it isntthe fantasy comedy begins in barbie land a place where barbie played bymargot robbie is having the best day every day in the company of other barbies and occasionally kens the designs costumes and cinematography do an excellent job recreating the mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection the introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film it is smartly selfaware and presents a world where barbie can be anything  a president a physicist a journalist a lawyer or a mermaid much like with the original toys ken ryan gosling comes as an afterthought and only exists within the warmth of barbies gazethe plot is set in motion when barbie begins having thoughts about death and normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet she feels her heels hit the ground what follows isthe wizard of oz 1939journey in reverse the parallel is explicit and ultimately a pinocchio storyline of the doll in the real worldif barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit  as promised by the trailer  it could be an interesting exploration in the way ofthe truman show 1998orstranger than fiction 2006 instead the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts threats and plotlines that are never fully realised what is the nature of the connection between a barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the real world what would happen if barbie were put back in the box why is gloria america ferrera the receptionist at the mattel headquarters and later barbies realworld companion depressed  and how is that eventually resolved why is glorias daughter sasha ariana greenblatt cross with her mother why does the board of mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes most importantly the crux of the thirdact conflict  set in barbie land now renamed kendom  contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitantstowards the finale the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles one side is presented as clueless and attentionseeking while the other is manipulative and vengeful the film repeatedly takes offence with mansplaining yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience rather than on storytelling while the denouement includes one of the films highlights the musical number im just ken the ending does not resolve or acknowledge much and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensivebarbie is very easy on the eye and the acting ranges from competent to inspired with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors margot robbie is pitchperfect as barbie and ryan gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing the show situational comedy and slapstick mostly land while some of the bon mots are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by the charactersif only this were better written if only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth,0.986,positive
3,imseeg,22-Jul-23,the first reason to go see itits good fun its fairytale comedy over the top pastiche and it works it simply does margot robie and ryan gosling have great chemistry everybody sorta agrees on thatkids are probably not the target audience although if they would watch it they wouldnt be shocked or something they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenesthe second reason to go see itit really looks the part i am not into sets or costumes in particular at all but i was impressed with the fun world they had created it really looks fabulous and i really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finishthe third and best reason to go see iti am a dude and i honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife but i honestly did not expect this sugarcoated fairytale barbieworld to touch my heart in the end but it did what the whatthey somehow created a finale that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe you cant wish for more than that as a dude watching a barbie picture hellothe only reason against seeing itif you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women then better not go see it because all the men are hilarious loosers and whiners in this movie with a brilliant performance by ryan gosling as an insecure crybaby who just cant get barbie to love himfeared the worst but in the end i was pleasantly suprised its certainly not a brilliant movie but it is a perfect summer escape movie with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe,0.9969,positive
4,Natcat87,22-Jul-23,as a woman that grew up with barbie i was very excited for this movie i was curious to see how they would evolve the stereotypical barbie into something more but the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot i consider myself a proponent of gender equality and this aint the way to get itbarbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world giving women the power and leaving the kens as attractive accessories once ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to barbieland and the barbies are brainwashed this happens suddenly and without much explanation the kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance and barbieland falls into disarraythe movies solution to this is for the barbies to give a lot of ted talks on the patriarchy fool the kens into war with each other and rule once again but isnt the point if gender equality equalitythe feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so thick more humor and nuance please the story gets lost the real world characters dont add much and not much changes in the endwhat was enjoyable was the acting the sets and of course the nostalgia,0.78,positive
5,G-Joshua-Benjamin,21-Jul-23,i dont know if i put spoilers in here i am super worn out haha so i will just put that i didi had no clue what this movie was like or about it just seemed like a strange different type of movie to me it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect it was nothing like thatthere were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me i felt weird knowing that there is no way i would bring a kid or teen to see thisthe movie is really all focused on political and gender views so that one totally surprised methere are points in which i kind of rolled my eyes a bit of the singing kind of went on there were also times that i was all tearythere are sexual references in this young kids would not understand but one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have and a specific thing ken does not have that was a bit strangethe end threw me off here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal but we are not treated that way yet at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots also something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were but unlike the way things seem to be in barbie land the women will be above all men i didnt really get that then what may be the last lines of the movie place barbie somewhere i didnt get the point of iti heard adults laughing repeatedly the kids that were their kind of sat silentthis is one of those movies that i cannot see every watching again but it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater also i dug the set design all the other stuff in the barbie world it was just cool to see,0.9271,positive
6,coxaneesa,24-Jul-23,i thought this would be so much different the ending made me feel sad and empty ken and barbie dont end up together and they made ken seem like a complete idiot actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie and im not a man but thats just not true it was depressing and sad and never the way barbie was created for i know a lot of people wont agree with me and thats okay but it was just pointless going to see it the only good thing is that the barbie aesthetic was beautifully donei just do not like the way they presented men its almost like they want women to turn against men which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people,-0.8721,negative
7,Revuer223,23-Jul-23,the quality the humor and the writing of the movie is fun for a while its quirky and its unique when they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes the movie is a miss the middle expositional phase of the movie i must say is a borethe movie was so close to being great but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialoguewhat could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end but i guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings,0.9698,positive
8,MissSimonetta,20-Jul-23,i went to see this today everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastelcolored camp for two hours barbie kind of succeeds there i loved the costuming and sets of barbieland and margot robie is such a fantastic actress the perfect embodiment of the optimistic shecandoitall barbie ryan gosling was a scenestealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coatdespite all this the movie as a whole was disappointing as much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat the messaging is so on the nose spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain not that these scenes cant be funny or hit home the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks but a little subtlety could not have hurti also had issues with the differences between barbieland and the real world i can accept everyone in barbieland talking in what many term marvel speak if youve watched anything made in the past 15 years youll recognize it right away you know we make all these pop culture references like spiderman in the mcu with aliens and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because its so awkward that its funny oooor it was when it was novel and new years ago now its staler than a can of pepsi clear oh yeah i remember the 90s macarenathe barbies and kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance however the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite messy complicated not that charming why are they also talking like that it just feels lazyand then there are the existential themes margot robies barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise at the end she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning a decent theme too bad the movie never really delves into it its given lip service nothing moreit had some cute moments but honestly the end experience was meh the hype was more memorable than the finished product,0.9868,positive
9,portraitofaladyonfire,20-Jul-23,greta gerwig and noah baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life whether funny or deeply interpersonal into a screenplay gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitionsunfortunately the only major weakness of the film in my opinion also lies in the screenplay when dealing with larger societal issues it lacks depth and possibly understanding the observations work but the contextualization falls short the approach feels crude and superficial this creates a confusing overall impression as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing a film that is so intelligent funny and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of thingskey moments in the film such as the encounter with the inventor fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere the angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap there seems to be a lack of sensitivity as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligentlyany scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated rather than being convincing parts of a larger wholeoverall im not entirely sure what to make of the film on one hand i had a great time but on the other hand i left the screening with mixed feelingsmaking it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board with ryan gosling obviously standing out,0.6932,positive
10,AngelHonesty,3-Aug-23,i played with barbies a lot as a kid so i thought this movie was going to be fun the trailer looked great i thought why not lets have a girls movie night kick back relax watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid but i was greatly let down really fast the movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is what a man is how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are there was nothing in the movie that made me laugh it all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling its definitely not a kids movie either i dont think they would understand half of it really wasnt happy with the movie,0.9571,positive
11,kayleewillis-85920,27-Aug-23,this is a movie that was way overhyped everyone kept saying it was so amazing but when i finally go to watch it it was not at all what i thought it was going to be the storyline was not good it was a basic and corny storyline in my opinioni didnt care for how they portrayed ken ryan gosling is an amazing actor but he is not a good representation of ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual ken doll looks the way he acted as ken was not that good either but he didnt get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part the movie had so much potential but was definitely a let down one positive is that it had some funny parts but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline,0.938,positive
12,L3MM3,9-Aug-23,i do not usually write reviews but this is beyond description last time i wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time this is almost as bad at least gosling plays his part well but the story is abysmal if you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry then yes please do you will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow  nearly two hours long this was mindnumbing storytelling at its mediocre worst how many ways can i say do not go see it if you have a choice see anything else but this exercise in horrendous cliches and exaggerated selfimportance if i could give it negative 10 stars i would,-0.9605,negative
13,finnconnelly-63017,22-Jul-23,wow i did not see this masterpiece coming and thats not a joke somehow greta gerwig took barbie and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issueswell its crazy but wow does it work the story is very mature thinker of a plot once youre done laughing your butt off youll get really emotional the production design is so on point the whole movie is pink everything but its never polarizing all the shades melt together in a very pleasing way and of course the cast margot robbie was born to play barbie and she hits a home run but ryan gosling this dude rocks as ken he knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head he steals every scene hes in and i would be so on board with a ken spinoff america ferrara and simu liu are also great in their respective roles but the cast overall is just perfect overall barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy sorry lego movies and an overall fantastic time at the movies,0.9938,positive
14,hamsterination,19-Jul-23,the films universe and settings are fantastic the casting is really good too with gosling excelling in the role of kenregrettably however the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with barbie instead were left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women in an attempt to make it a feminist and political filminstead of seeing a light fun film i saw a rather heavyhanded movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchyits a real shame because the films potential is pretty amazing i came away disappointed but not totally disgusted either,0.9046,positive
15,antoniatejedabarros,29-Aug-23,margot robbie and ryan gosling are really great in their roles of barbie and kent gosling is specially hilarious i expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but i was highly disappointed the movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment we the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite and im a woman the script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad there are some great actresses that have too little to say like emma mackey and thats a pity overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity 310 1 point for margot robbie 1 point for ryan gosling and 1 point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as barbies world,-0.6458,negative
16,Genti25,20-Jul-23,this movie is so much fun it starts off really strong although the story does move away from barbieland sooner than i would have liked nonetheless it regains its footing with the final act in particular and i could not stop laughing at ryan goslings portrayal of ken that song will forever be stuck in my headthere are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience that is if youre not an insecure middleaged male terrified of women i loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much morei am excited to watch it again soon the pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched but purely as a cinematic experience i will never forget this movie,0.8029,positive
17,fscsgxp,20-Jul-23,ive been excited for this movie for over a year the casting was perfect and the acting was amazing the set was next level the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldnt ask for anything more from it it is perfectionthe first half of the movie was really good a decent plot plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on unfortunately after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism  how oppressed women are im a woman myself and im all for equal rights but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely it felt very forced and by the end you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post so sad spoilers ahead even more sad the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens or men are they manipulate them undermine them and then when given the chance to be better the kens asking to have one ken presented in the supreme court which is all barbies they laugh and tell them no choosing to treat the kens or men how theyve always treated women so they are no better than the kens in the end how sad isnt there a world where they can be better include the kens and all be equals what are we trying to teach young girls that feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past also i would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how hard women have it life is hard for most people men  women alike and its easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species,0.9452,positive
18,herrcarter-92161,23-Jul-23,my 15year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my imdb accountas a barbie fan i was very excited for this movie i was expecting a lighthearted goofy comedy instead i got a movie that felt as though it didnt know where it was going or what it was doingthe movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy then things start changingthings start going wrong for barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it she is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in barbie land this on its own wouldve been enough for a movie but it keeps goinginstead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for barbie the movie goes off in a totally different directionken sees the real worlds patriarchy and goes back to barbie land to replicate it barbie has to go back to barbie land to save it from its new patriarchyby the end of the movie barbie decides to live in the real world the kens of the barbie land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising i find the treatment of the kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movies supposed messaging about equalitythis movies writing and plot were bad even as a feminist i acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy i feel as though many of these different plot ideas couldve been good on their own they are just too confusing all togetheron a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good i loved seeing the plastic barbie houses lifesized the movie was also very funny at parts i just wish the movie picked a clearer direction,0.9566,positive
19,cmdown-50506,29-Jul-23,i have been waiting for this to release for so long and i finally got to watch it today i absolutely loved it it was fun it had margot robbie and extra stuff for tarantinos out there if you know what i mean and it had some absolute bangers what more could you want from a new summer classichonestly the depth of the story aint there but what do you expect from a film about a barbie lol ill probably go back and watch it again tbh and ill probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as i did rather enjoy it seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing there are some touching moments where robbie really shines i just wish there were a little more because as everyone i absolutely adore margot and her filmsanyway barbie is a blast its a definite recommend on my list,0.9736,positive
20,popyoshi-36312,6-Nov-23,completely forgot to review this the sets are easily the best theyre really gorgeous to look at the characters are fun to watch and the characters are all really enjoyable the movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene i also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality its done for jokes though so i know its not meant to be an actual message with the humour i just think it weakens the messaging of the film its still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall its a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao i personally didnt find it to funny but i still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling,0.992,positive
21,tm-sheehan,19-Jul-23,"my review  barbie
in cinemas now
my rating 6510ive been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because im a great fan of margo robbie ryan gosling and greta gerwigs worki held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and id love it or a huge disappointment and id loathe it in other words no in between for mehow ever thats not the case i didnt love it and i didnt loathe it i have to accept that i
just didnt get it perhaps its because that im a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they wont see barbiethe audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that i didnt and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusionno spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be barbie and ken leave the other barbies and kens behind in barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical barbie played to perfection by margo robbie  barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimismken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by ryan gosling joins barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at venice beach california complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of barbie land are reversed in the real world  the question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live inpink cloud sunny barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and diemargo robbie and ryan gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the filmbarbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while i hope its popular for the creators of the movie im left puzzled at what audience its aimed at the male population that greta gerwig cleverly parodies through ken and his ken buddies certainly wouldnt see her movie and i think the disney generation of under 15 would be bored i did enjoy the technical aspects of barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbusteri also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like stanley kubrics 2001 a space odysee  saturday night fever and of course the wizard of oz its one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of warner bros then in 2019 they finally announced margot robbie and greta gerwig as the lead actordirector duo for this filmdirector greta gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with noah baumbach basing their story on the famous barbie fashion dolls by mattel  it is the first live action barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success mattel the toy company that created barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in greta gerwigs clever perhaps to clever scriptmattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the oldschool charm of the barbie world intact and i suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous barbie dolls get a mention in this filmnoah baumbach is executive producer as well as his partner greta gerwig and margo robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of 145 million usmargo robbie has been quoted as saying that the films aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences the thing you didnt know you wantedim not so sure about that statement as barbie didnt reach my expectations and i felt the thing i didnt know i wanted wasnt what i wanted at alltop marks to cinematographer rodrigo prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that greta gerwig named technibarbie after the technicolor format also top marks to two time academy award winner designer jacqueline durran its a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie",0.999,positive
22,imdbmovieguy,21-Jul-23,i really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie it was very upbeat positive and light however things soon became negative about 20  25 minutes into the movie i couldnt stand it barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer kens attitude was sour for the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityi bought tickets to this show a month ago and i saw it the day before the official opening day i was very excited about this movie and i was playing the music dua lipa song almost every day i was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive but the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing it was just too much the movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast i would have preferred a more shallow and fun barbie movie vs this barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,0.7245,positive
23,GhostFoxX,24-Jul-23,i personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous correct me if im wrong but isnt that what it is supposed to be its literally a movie about barbie instead it felt more like an agent of woke culture and basically mattels the company that produces barbie dolls way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier it continuously tried to portray the fact that mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls it is now producing dolls of all colors and races well that is definitely a good thing but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong if they didnt quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous why make the marketing events misleading they couldve just focused on the audience for whom it was made rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure sadly it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem,0.9358,positive
24,anjamulder,19-Jul-23,this is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back and me i left the theatre in such a good mood it was the sense of humor for me laughed so hard specially ryan gossling was sooooo good and funny many familiar faces to spot also and margot robbie come on the perfect casting for barbie i also have to say the way they created barbie land was so amazing it just makes you just want to there i dont really have anything bad to say about this movie i can understand not everyone will love it but i am sure it is a iconic film already,0.8964,positive
25,njamesgentry,17-Sep-23,margot robbie was born to play barbie of course shes incredibly beautiful talented funny and hip however i didnt have some lifealtering epiphany like so many others did i actually thought the film was way too cheesy 45 minutes too long and also confusing at times i love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint the idea of ken learning about misogyny and sexism essentially bringing these twisted ideas to barbieland leading all barbies to succumb to a more subservient role while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power talents intelligence and individuality but after an hour or so i kept thinking why cant barbie just sing a song i wanted a fluffier comedic barbie while what i got was a doll having an existential crisis it was depressing at times the cast was phenomenal of course i just didnt expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling,0.6146,positive
26,ambusched94,13-Sep-23,the film opens strongly with margot robbie and ryan gosling delivering compelling performances their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie however as the film progresses and barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world the thin plot becomes more noticeable some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message as the film can be seen as overly direct leading to a polarizing and preachy tone this approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with greta gerwigthe production design of barbie land is visually captivating offering a feast for the eyes the music soundtrack featuring a standout disco track by dua lipa complements the film well dua lipas cameo as mermaid barbie is a highlightthe film incorporates satire and selfaware humor which adds depth to the story however the humor doesnt consistently land and some moments feel forced the character stereotypical ken provides sporadic moments of humorin summary barbie is a film worth watching at least once it includes an empowerment monologue delivered by america ferreras character addressing societal expectations placed on women while there is still some double standard in gender role expectations it is less prominent in todays society compared to the past,0.8024,positive
27,AvionPrince16,19-Jul-23,im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest it was kind of weird and strange at the beginning we understand it later because we are in the barbie world so they played with the culture reference of the barbie the dolls and what they represent an ideal world with where the womans are in power things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems sexual remark womens and their place in society the inequality with mens i was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world its pretty obvious that they will talk about it i love also how ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in barbie land i understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial but i enjoyed that barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in barbie land i mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok and i still think its a great barbie movie the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design the colors the camera movements i think people who played with barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society some moments were also absurd  the fight with all the kens its good anyway,0.9955,positive
28,arslanmanzoor123,21-Jul-23,some friends freaking out that i went to see barbie lol i mean i mentioned i went coz my sister insisted since ages anyway the movie was bad these days every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that i wished i had gotten the ticket for oppenheimer in the same timings as my sisters barbie show other than that the acting done by margot robbie and ryan gosling was great so cant take that away from them they did justice to their roles,0.8957,positive
29,dreopdreef,19-Jul-23,the concept of a barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited but unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of latelyit started off quite funny but after 45 minutes or so the movie went in a direction i did not like it took itself a bit too serious i would have preferred a more lighthearted movieryan gosling did the best job out of everyone playing ken i thought the perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy girly and insecure job well done especially toward the endif you are a fan of barbie you will probably get your moneys worth,0.9789,positive
30,spika13,25-Jul-23,its like watching at trumans show but all the set its pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas i grew up with barbie dolls and i felt very disappointed i was expecting a different kind of story the ending was the worst i think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of simone de bouvoir we all deserve the same rights in the end instead of just barbie land they should changed as barbie and ken landdefinitely is not the best movie of gretai enjoyed the music the set and loved the clothes although i excepted to hear the aqua song why it wasnt played in the movieanyway its not a bad movie its just good movie,0.2094,positive
31,max-850,27-Aug-23,i believe i came to this movie with an open mind in my opinion a movie balled barbie needs to be a comedy and while there were pieces here and there that were funny for the most part we and everyone in the theater only laughed occasionally the production design and costumes are great the screenplay is the weakest part the direction is next weakest and those two caused a great cast to overact when this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious its preachy we are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking this is not engaging why cant we think for ourselves based on what we see i hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals thoughts and feelings but then maybe the target audience is tenyearolds in any event i thought it would never end by the time they were talking about ordinary barbie all i could think was sanctimonious barbie,0.418,positive
32,badreviewer,1-Aug-23,yes day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else ok barbie itself was not a creative idea i know and actually i didnt expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place all in all its barbiebut wouldnt you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better it totally could have been this movie has a huge budget then why such a mediocre story at best im not saying it was a bad movie as well but it was just ok just thatnowadays movies have become nothing else but liveactions sequels and prequels now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie unfortunately barbie does not fall short in these criterias,0.9542,positive
33,maxlagerholm,15-Sep-23,they really did some fantastic marketing with this movieits not exactly bad its just mediocre its very pretty to look at and some of the music is actually quite funny and fittingbut this is nowhere near what was advertised its not a fun jokey movie that brought homage to old movies some saterical jokes etc its that followed by story with heaaaavy messaging followed again by a quick jokehowever none of it is funny or interesting enough to justify its runtime the ending in particular was very obvious and just kept going its so clear they want you to feel something but you dont its just not interesting enough with the story they out forth and how long the ending goes on for,0.8084,positive
34,jacquihives,23-Jul-23,i loved barbie growing up and even at 42 years old i couldnt wait to go see the movie i didnt have any expectations because i had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie thats for adults and not kids i adored barbieland but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie it got silly had no storyline was overly political and woke man bashing and made men silly and i really didnt care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crudethe music is good but i wasnt prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one pointryan gosling as ken stole the show he looked like he was having the time of his life making this moviemargot robbie is perfect as barbie but it wasnt that interesting to watch and i didnt understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in,0.4413,positive

36,adamblackshaw-14445,29-Aug-23,barbie is a great example of hype over substance it is laugh out loud at times and gosling steals every scene hes in the art direction is on point what makes it tiresome is the message pummelled into the audience but then were we expecting any subtly probably not ultimately my wife just thought i already know this i dont need to hear it but maybe some women do i get her point in the end it felt like we were being sold barbie dolls as some kind of icon of feminism but seriously they are a very poor example of female role models not surprisingly mattel was one of the producers,-0.4627,negative
37,moviesgamesandvideos,9-Sep-23,the film does not live up to the marketing its about as subtle as a steamroller and deep as a puddle there must be primary school books with more depth and nuance than this filmthe music is good and the plot moves along at pace but its like it was written by an angsty tween yay feminism is about as deep as the message gets and its pretty much the entire purpose and plot of the film it doesnt offer up anything to think about just a bubblegum world that is just a carbon copy of the toyswith all the barbenhiemer hype and marketing i expected more from the movie oppenheimer and barbie are about as polar opposites of filmmaking as its possible to get,0.9337,positive
38,nethy-nho,23-Jul-23,but it is also in its smallest details from the art direction costumes and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all barbie generations and the like a soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying yes very musical moments after all it is a barbie movie in addition to the handpicked cast margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings just with her eyes gretas direction and screenplay just amazing strong emotional empowering and very very feminist not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause but to open everyones eyes to a sisterhood,0.9455,positive
39,Snootz,7-Sep-23,this is an odd movie on the one hand the presentation of the barbie world and mattel making fun of itself is fantasticbut on the theme  plot  moral of the story side all i came up with is a big what the barbies are initially presented as real life dolls who all have vital roles in society but in reality are scripted airheads who live the same life every day the kens are presented as bumbling fools who live only to grovel at the feet of the barbies which is kind of how the toys really are i guess i can get the satirebut then we get further into the movie and the kens become pompous overlords and the barbies mysteriously for no reason whatsoever turn into kenworshippers without a real purpose of their ownsomehow this is all supposed to represent masculine vs feminine roles in real life but in truth dont accurately represent either the movie presents a real world in which all men are successful and in charge and all women are subjected and repressed while that does exist are there no female doctors attorneys real estate moguls business owners etc etcthe movie presents this as extremes and doesnt really do a very good job of it about 23 of the way through i cant tell whether the movie is against sexism or promoting it the roles of the sexes become clouded and like so many feminist movies weve seen men are presented as idiots and women revert barbie world right back to its femaledominated statusas a result although semibrilliant in presentation the movie is preachy heavyhanded bigoted and loses the element of believeability and relevance i had been told the movie is great but because of the questionable script its just so soi enjoyed it but in the end wondered exactly what the movie was trying to say and in the end the barbie doll joins the real world whats that all about perhaps they had some hidden meaning there but im not sure exactly what it wasi give it 6 stars better than mediocre because of the sets presentation and often enjoyable script lines but theres a lot of headscratching when it comes to the point this movie was actually trying to make if any,0.972,positive
40,tylertubisjr,27-Jul-23,i was not expecting this movie to be great im not into this kind of stuff but still i watched it and man it was great some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays like come on everything and everyone can be cancelled the overall acting of the cast is super great i love it almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie like this song by the way im just ken the production set for this film is majestic and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life and there can be something to learn from very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends,0.9904,positive
41,agjbull,23-Jul-23,i really wanted to enjoy this and i know that i am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow the film was very disjointed ryan gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play ken and will ferrell ruined every scene he was in i just didnt get it it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed a waste of some great talent it was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none margo robbie looks beautiful throughout the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didnt make much sense at all,0.6492,positive
42,mr_bickle_the_pickle,25-Jul-23,its an incredibly fun movie lots of laughs very campy over the top humour but also surprisingly touching my favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is margot robbie shines in the lead role ryan gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role but dont sleep on michael cera as allan i know a lot of people say that ryan gosling is a scene stealer but personally i thought michael wasthe soundtrack also works really within the film i dont know how many of them i would listen to separately i also wouldnt be suprised if either im just ken or what was i made for or both was nominated for an oscar speaking of oscars i think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design costumes hair and makeup  because visually this movie is such a treatnow i dont think all aspects worked for me i dont think the mattelceo subplot was needed there could have been another way for her to go back to barbieland organically i felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this chase scene didnt add much also glorias america ferrera monologue now dont get me wrong i think there is a lot truth to it but i just found it somewhat onenote it didnt exactly blow me away as it has for others and lastly i undertstand the importance of having ruth handler featured in the moviejust a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in mattel headquartersoverall i would definitely recommend the film youll laugh youll cry youll have fun this isnt just a movie it is the moment,0.9932,positive
43,kk-59333,6-Nov-23,the movie isnt as fantastic as it was hyped to be its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected instead it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of girls can do anything and find yourself the most controversial aspect of the barbie character whether it exacerbates womens appearance anxiety is hardly mentioned at all in my view its essentially a reiteration of the same old themes just presented in updated ways however considering hollywoods consistent conservatism and focus on profits i appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the worlds most profitdriven film industry,0.5078,positive
44,MatthewMichaelHoffman,20-Jul-23,score 9510queue the perhaps i treated you too harshly ive seen this movie 6 times now that is not a mistake and it did not happen on accident i love this movie and yes its not perfect but it is way better than i had originally scored it and continued to score it each time i rewatched it i think on my first watch i just couldnt get over how much of the film i had already seen from the marketing there was an overwhelming amount of the movie revealed in things leading up to the release the story is still lacking in some areas but this genuinely might be the most entertaining movie of all time the music is mesmerizing the acting performances are unbelievable and i never want to stop rewatching italso i like to pick out new things each time i rewatch it no one is talking about hockey barbie she might have been my favorite she is drop dead gorgeousoriginal score 7810letterboxd continues to be goated the pink heart is a nice touch maybe my expectations were a bit too high but could you blame me the marketing for this movie was undoubtedly some of the best that has ever been done the film wasnt bad by any stretch of the imagination but there definitely was a feeling of being underwhelmed which has to do with a lot of things first because the marketing was so amazing it felt like i had seen 75 of the movie already before stepping foot in the theater the story is good but i think it really struggled with straddling the line between being a social commentary and being goofy and funny it did a decent job of both but each side hindered the ability for the other to have maximum impact because of that it led to a lot of parts feeling forced almost in an attempt to balance out the levels at very inopportune times the timing was slightly off and created a couple awkward stretches where you were waiting for something to be funny but it ended up being serious for a bit too longwith all that said i still have a fun time with the premiere and im not going to let knowing of all the good parts take away from how good they actually were the songs were catchy the vibes were superb and the cast was amazing michael cera as allan and his involvement in the story was definitely a nice surprise however to no surprise the stars of the show me and margot robbiei mean ryan gosling and margot robbie killed it as ken and barbie as a man i thought the jabs at men were hilarious and warranted the best type of comedy is relatable comedy and i think they did a good job with it the references to other movies were also cool especially their dig at zack snyders justice league the film bros are going to hate this movie the set pieces for this film were very impressive and greta gerwig seems like an amazing human beingmy criticisms of this movie are not to be taken as me being disappointed or even that i didnt like parts of it i think i just saw the potential this movie had and it flashed it to us occasionally but ultimately fell short i am happy to be living in a time where barbenheimer is happening and we can celebrate cinema together but i have a feeling that oppenheimer is going to blow this thing out of the water no pun intended if you look at my perfect score ranking you will see that i am not shy to express my more feminine side and appreciate movies that maybe most men wouldnt i was really expecting for this film to be a huge hit for me but it ended up just being good which is okay i definitely still recommend for people to see it and i will be jamming to the songs of the soundtrack in my car well done greta and team,0.9993,positive

46,jacobarch,23-Jul-23,while the production value cinematography and acting were what you would expect from margo robbie and the supporting cast i felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity men and women cannot survive without each other but youd never know it watching this movie and me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater i kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came after the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda theyre trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that i thought she was proud day for me as a father,0.9186,positive
47,Lincsobserver,10-Sep-23,who exactly was this film aimed at most of the audience when i saw it were adolescents and there were numerous perhaps too many colourful song and dance scenes which might have appealed to younger viewers but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and interrelationships that would have gone over their heads particularly as these were delivered at a frantic garbled pace there were some good comic scenes and standout performances by margot robbie and ryan gosling but as the film wore on it all became a bit preachy the message seemed to be about finding selffulfilment rather than romance okay not every film or every life has to end in a fairytale romantic coupling but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak it also makes nonsense of the final confusing payoff line of the film,0.8573,positive

49,Leofwine_draca,20-Aug-23,barbie is a film i find incredibly difficult to both review and rate on the face of it the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place the audience i saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable like gosling bouncing off the plastic wave and missing all of the depth which is what i personally found appealing its very hard to take such a tongueincheek approach seriously but then you could argue that its deliberately bad deliberately plasticky not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of ferrera et al despite this the films skewering of the patriarchy is spoton and gosling turns out to be very good stealing the film from the others so its a film i appreciate some parts of and not others,-0.8915,negative
50,MaskedMinty,21-Jul-23,"let me start by saying that im by no means a conservative or traditional woman i believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems but damnthis movie is so corporate and shallow its clearly ordered and tailored by executives at mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls the movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good but then it just goes downhill the premise of the owners feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a persons life journey and then barbie and ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching this movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling they keep repeating the same dialogues patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism not even one time but multiple times these characters go into random rants like its a ted talk the chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe you cant root for them or feel their feelings at all barbie should have understood how kens had been feeling in the barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society just existing for the gaze of a woman man yet what do they do they manipulate them with a super nonsense plan and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality i guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh
i can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this people are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the not taking itself serious bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids the only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and margot robbie and ryan gosling have acted very well besides this they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and i would have respected the creators more pass",0.9726,positive

52,dmmart-28624,23-Jul-23,i was pretty excited to see this film and hope im not going to get put on a list for saying i didnt enjoy it that much the message of female empowerment was fine but didnt really speak to gender equality barbieland is the opposite of real world where barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories however the ending just puts barbies back on top and doesnt do much to equality which i hope is our goal the movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up you could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there they wanted ken to take the patriarchy back to barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the kens being bumbling morons the entire movie its all payoff and no buildup good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didnt make much sense i think this was a made for tik tok movie where theres 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together,0.8972,positive

54,tforbes-2,1-Aug-23,barbie is simply a mindblowing experience and in a truly fine way i was taken aback with the 2001 opening since i have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed but then it starts to unfoldand what we have is a combination of the twilight zone and 1971s willy wonka and the chocolate factoryit really focuses in on one barbie margot robbie who finds herself out of her element and her struggle to comes to terms with herself though the film has some weirdness to it it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shinesand its messages pack a wallopthe casting is top notch starting with ms robbie in the title role ryan gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well with a wide range but one actress truly deserves a best supporting actress oscar and that is america ferrara the other performers are likewise greatim also struck by how mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isnt always flattering and toward the end we have the barbie dolls creator ruth handler rhea perlman tell ms robbies character some facts about herself that are less than flattering that scene alone is incredibly powerfuland of course the visuals are something to beholdon the whole a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality highly recommended,0.9675,positive
55,AvionPrince16,19-Jul-23,im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest it was kind of weird and strange at the beginning we understand it later because we are in the barbie world so they played with the culture reference of the barbie the dolls and what they represent an ideal world with where the womans are in power things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems sexual remark womens and their place in society the inequality with mens i was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world its pretty obvious that they will talk about it i love also how ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in barbie land i understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial but i enjoyed that barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in barbie land i mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok and i still think its a great barbie movie the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design the colors the camera movements its good anyway,0.9946,positive

58,fernandoschiavi,22-Jul-23,despite the strong commercial tone it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by greta gerwig director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way  although in this case it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichs the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director  in addition to margot robbie herself as a producer barbie has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today and the film does it with a big heart the story is genuinely fun with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists reserving touching moments and provoking reflections especially in its final stretch debauchery is the great ally of gerwig and baumbach to deal not only with sexism but also with the corporate issue it wont be strange if you catch yourself thinking how did mattel let this film see the light of day laughing at yourself after all seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itselfin the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the barbie universe the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project in these changes of atmosphere we were able to appreciate the creative photography by rodrigo prieto  who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit  and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices such as costume pieces type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001 a space odyssey here well catch glimpses of the wizard of oz and the truman show well go through the fairytalelike artificiality of jacques demys films for the dance and choreographic performance of gene kelly for the visual and dramatic intensity of the little red shoes and all that jazz its a lot barbie is a well of enriching cinematographic referencesbut leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look in addition to addressing important points of todays society greta gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms barbie into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism the production is very much in line with a famous quentin tarantino interview in 2021 given to bill maher on his hbo broadcast real time in which he said ultimately ideology trumps art individual effort good entertainment unfortunately in this film this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war used as a puppet by political militancy full of language allegories open messages and ideological discourses the film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone to be a comedy and romance epic and it had the quality to do so but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrolthe film has an interesting premise thats undeniable and it flows most of the time but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn since the target audience here is females of all ages this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy criticism of beauty standards the hypocritical discourse against consumerism as if warner mattel artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales from selling new dolls etc manhatred all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idits gredy dmb or wanting power for themselves greta gerwigs goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard because the stereotyped barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy  the character sasha played by ariana greenblatt is the one who plays this role like the militant of today always connected and who knows everything about life where gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentionsthe truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate not love barbie here hates men capitalism fun and hates barbie doll herself calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll if youre a woman and you played with her as a kid according to the movie you supported patriarchy barbie cant just be a pretty blonde thin woman either after all that doesnt encompass the mandatory diversity and inclusion in hollywood today to resolve this issue they created a universe in which everyone is barbie we even have a barbie who was born a man yes a trans barbie  who by the way is a doctor the men in barbieland who cares are there to be mistreated and ignored ken is just an accessory when barbie and ken come into the real world everything changes ken discovers patriarchy a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot and likes that world barbie finds unbridled machismo if barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense romance between barbie and ken not at all after all that wouldnt be empowering at all ken even rejects the doll at one pointken represents the evil patriarchy everything in this film becomes one big lecture one big sermon barbie scolding workers who whistle at her police officers harassing barbie at the police station a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue that is victim of the toxic men of the world barbie still has to choose between flipflops and heels showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made follow feminism that is flipflops we also have the passage of the protagonist gloria cheating on her husband a fool by the way and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheatingall male clichs are portrayed here according to the feminist view because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time according to the films script here the barbies were coopted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the kens in a kind of macho dystopia everything ken likes is depicted as toxic evil and terrible stallone godfather horses zack snyder etc barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women women have everything men have nothing mattel executives are all portrayed as white straight men and still calls this type of profile conservative fascist for the director it is never enough to be a woman you have to be a mother a wife work and still receive criticism the unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies and that they cannot study work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work yes because apparently the evil businessmen hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job at the end of the plot glorias feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy kens are beaten because they are dmb the barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective ken jealous with another ken of course after all all men only know how to create wars destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid after all if men are stupid why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film a basic and inexplicable plot hole herebarbie is a great satire but when it touches on feminist issues it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men since women are portrayed as being totally perfect sasha and gloria are the main latin characters here and the barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas obviously the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and of course the popularity of the barbie doll that has been successful for generations in addition to having many merits especially in the technical part the detailed creative and extremely tasteful scenarios especially in barbieland are a spectacle in themselves in addition to the magnificent performances by margot robbie charismatic and incredibly beautiful and ryan gosling hilarious as ever the musicals on the other hand are horrible poorly performed and owing a lot in that regardbarbie talks about choices and changes in the hands of greta gerwig the typical behavior of dolls and dolls via imagination takes on a critical form and points to many paths visiting metalanguage politicalsocial relations patriarchy and feminism feelings including the arrogant and insensitive posture of barbie in front of ken as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend existential crises or acceptance of ones social and gender condition the work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a liveaction barbie that is undeniable the problem is that in the end barbie doesnt even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of selfdiscovery who is barbie,0.9966,positive

60,terryforma,24-Jul-23,i really enjoyed the movie the acting was amazing margot robbie and ryan gosling was amazing i just thought it was too on the nose like the message was literally forced in your face it seemed lazy to me i went in thinking it was going to be similar to the truman show and i wished it hadve taken some elements from it because it wouldve made it much more powerful if so im not going to spoil the ending but i thought the writers just gave up overall for me its a 610 good film but thats all definitely couldve been less preachy ultimately its nice movie to see and id see it again at some point but it wasnt great,0.9153,positive

explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of barbie a parody of 2001 a space odyssey and how barbie came to change the world barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of

sashas mother gloria ugly bettys america ferrera a mattel employee who is the person who was playing with her gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis she was playing with sashas old barbie

an inspirational speech about societys conflicting expectations of women and barbies selfconfidence is restored meanwhile the ceo and board members are making their way to barbieland with the assistance of sasha weird barbie kens friend allan michael cera a lone and discontinued character and other discontinued dolls gloria repeats her moving words to all barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours ken intends to cement the changes to barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution allowing men to become president and replace all other roles taken by

barbielands previous societal system they decide to make changes including better treatment for the kens and all outcast dolls barbie and ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without barbie she encourages him to find himself barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity she suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where

proust barbie rob brydon as sugar daddy ken and costume designer ann roth as the woman on the bench robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable stereotypical barbie going on an adventure gosling as the muscly foolish attentionseeking ken is splendid mckinnon is hilarious as the mangled weird barbie ferrera is good support ferrell is amusing many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific and the voice of mirren occasionally breaking the fourth wall is great gerwig and her cowriterreallife partner noah baumbach frances ha marriage story were given full creative freedom for the script they are unafraid to poke fun at the barbie world including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys and interesting ideas of feminism body image female empowerment the battle of the sexes and the human experience the visuals are sugarcoated and saturated with colour pink obviously most prominent with impressive set and costume design and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs pink by lizzo dance the night by dua lipa the original barbie girl by aqua does not feature there is the new version by nicki minaj and ice spice with aqua and fun song and dance routines it could have been a conventional girly barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy very good,0.9993,positive
62,moriumemoltre,20-Jul-23,i was really surprised about how much i liked ryan gosling in this i had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing the movie works there is definitely a moral message in this even though i believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by margot robbie and ryan goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed i feel like with a different script they could have created something truly greatover all its a fun family movie to enjoy together i watched this and afterwards oppenheimer last night and i am truly glad i did it in that order because i doubt that i would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if i had watched oppenheimer first,0.9887,positive
63,ThereelscoopwithKK,15-Aug-23,the casting for the roles is pretty well spot on margot robbie is an absolute superstar and nobody would fit the role of barbie better i liked the little joke when barbie says im not pretty anymore im not stereotypical barbie pretty and the narrator replies  note to the filmmakers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point even when they try to make margot robbie less pretty they cant really achieve it robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as wellthey also found perfect roles for ryan gosling and will ferrell the roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie the costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with barbies beforethe movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldnt ever really decide what it was this led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you arent sure whether its going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send the problem is especially clear when the two blurred together i wasnt sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a jokethe ending made it all even more confusing i dont mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went downoverall i would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy  but i suppose the filmmakers knew best since theyre the ones raking in the cash right now kudos to them great casting but is it satire or social commentary,0.9967,positive
64,russellquisenberry,26-Jul-23,im not a barbie fan the only time i loved barbie was when she was in the toy story movies but that changed after i saw the barbie movie this movie is not only greta gerwigs best film but also the years greatest movie so far margot robbie my favorite actress of all time is beautiful and portrays barbie with pure perfection and then theres ken played by ryan gosling in a careerbest performance robbie and gosling shine and are easily the years best duothe story starts with barbie doing her usual routine in barbieland a land filled with multiple barbies each with a different occupation the kens also visit playing the roles a woman would play barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death crying and flat feet she learns from weird barbie that the real world will have the answers to her questions barbie than travels with ken to the real world and find out many things  barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named gloria america ferrera in her best movie performance mattel wants to put barbie back in the box and ken learns about americas patriarchy and men rule the world all of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to bethe production design of barbieland and costumes of all the barbies and kens are oscarworthy the soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs ryan goslings 80s ballad called im just ken and billie ellishs emotional song at the end of the movie what was i made forthe direction of greta gerwig is finally put to great use in barbie as shes goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner noah baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy greatcomedy drama and emotional dramagosling gives his best and definitely deserves an oscar nomination as his role of ken is up there with the comedy greats of meliss mccarthy in bridesmaids and robert downey jr in tropic thunderthe real scene stealer is margot robbie robbie has been in multiple box office failures but barbie changed that shes been nominated twice for the oscar for her incredible performances in i tonya and bombshell my favorite actress is about to be nominated for best actress and best picture for barbie margot robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in barbie which is the best performance of her whole career go margot robbiethis movie is definitely worth watching i want to watch it again,0.9992,positive
65,arcelivez-753-983928,10-Aug-23,honestly i really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular again honest  i went there just for margot robbie im a married 34 year old male and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time and arguably the most talented one from my list and for that part it was totally ok but the movie absolutely doesnt deserve an imdb rating above 56 the plot itself was very simple absolutely nothing particularly special in it so if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of margot alone then why do her other movies dont get rated that well and get that much attention honestly i really dont understand and i think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason and i have no idea why for other movies that get hyped like that i do see the reasons why theyre getting so hyped so the movie is not awful but its rather average if youre not going there specifically for margot then i am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time youre reading this which are way more worth watching than this one,0.965,positive
66,sjw1029,5-Aug-23,let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isnt from the mcu or a sequel doing so well at the box office there is still originality out there this movie was very funny  the scene with ken and the doctor in la made me laugh very hard its weird and inventive it has amazing choreography so many talented people worked on this i didnt grow up with barbies so im sure a lot of the jokes went over my head but it didnt hurt the enjoyment it even manages to land a sentimental note at the end i can definitely see this being a movie people see over and overside note greta gerwig must be a fan of sex education  three actors end up here,0.9565,positive
67,gianthaole,23-Jul-23,my wife and i did the double feature of barbie and oppenheimer barbie started off strong and ryan gosling is very funny in the movie the problem is none of the barbies are in a comedy this movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy it maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder who is this movie for little girls wont enjoy this teenage girls wont enjoy this adult women wont enjoy this so who is the target audience who are the preachy moments for if you are thinking of watching something this month choose sound of freedom or mission impossible,0.4617,positive
68,saimariejohnson,7-Aug-23,barbie surprised me in all the best ways it was funny moving inspirational and all around ridiculously entertaining i mean that with every sense of the implication tothere were moments that everyone could relate to the film  at least as i observed and it was heartfelt in delivery and message some of the narrator quirks delivered by helen mirren are just perfect and i found myself laughing more than anything elsethere are so many nuanced things that make the movie so sweet but the best is probably the nod to the original creator of barbie and the reason the doll was produced to start,0.9729,positive
69,Rice-and-Beans34,30-Jul-23,this movie is many things one may say it is a story of strength and finding the beauty in yourself others may just not like it i am in the middle of all of that the movie was a little better than meh but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more i think margot robbie and ryan gosling were good but i really didnt like their characters mostly ken the musical numbers and camera work were amazing but by far three things stood out to me one the costumes design and sets the directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it my honorable mention is rhea perlman i thought she was phenomenal while anyone could play that role she really brought it finally america ferrara since her days on ugly betty she has became a household name but in this movie she was wonderful i enjoyed superstore quite a bit and wanted to see barbie mainly for her character her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple yet relatable mom,0.9824,positive
70,edwardrevans,28-Jul-23,i saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young children they will get bored as this is not a kids movie it is on a higher intellectual plain than that you could honestly say this is a movie for feminists now thats not a bad thing as i saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with barbie when she was young shes 23 now this movie has its moments of comedy and is well done especially when in the barbie world and has been well thought out and written cast very well as the two leads carry the movie and im sure there will be a sequel but remember this is not a kids movie,0.9856,positive
71,michelle-kissler,21-Jul-23,this film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast stunning costumes and iconic character however it failed to live up to expectations falling flat just like spoiler barbies heelsthe script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their barbie dolls evoking a sense of nostalgia barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields including stembased jobs she helped promote young girls interest in science engineering math and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields barbie encouraged girls to dream big fostered a love for learning and promoted selfconfidencebarbie symbolizes beauty and fashionforwardness allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls playing with barbies also promoted emotional intelligence empathy creativity and problemsolving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in roleplayingregrettably this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional barbie doll instead of embracing themes of friendship teamwork feminism and selfdiscovery the film failed to deliver the friendships between the barbie characters felt superficial lacking depth rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances theres a monologue by america ferreras character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today i thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman but it never didin the spirit of equality i also had high hopes this film would promote barbie and not just a girls toy but a great toy for any kid girl or boy it didnt go there at allone aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of barbie and kens relationship which verged on being toxic it was evident that barbie did not reciprocate kens feelings creating an uncomfortable dynamic the movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others feelings ken was extremely codependent and barbie just saw him as an accessory yet when the tables were turned she didnt really learn anything from thatin terms of humor the movie fell short of expectations most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact additionally the ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place adding nothing substantial to the plotline it came across as awkward and disconnected failing to contribute meaningfully to the storyoverall the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewersadditionally barbies journey of selfdiscovery felt underwhelming culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologists office it would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that barbie stands for with the real world friendship kindness perseverance selfexpression and imagination sure shes ordinary realworld barbie but that doesnt mean she cant have extraordinarily character the story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audienceoverall i had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book,0.9971,positive
72,willsfamily11,29-Jul-23,i am a massive and lifelong barbie fanatic i went in to this movie absolutely pumped i came out of the movie blown away typical of barbie she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message america ferreras monologue in barbie land had people clapping in the theatre i appreciated it as a mother daughter sister wife and human being the truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels i know you are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer idea that a barbie movie could be in any way profound i say to you you must not really know barbie then this really was if i think about it in true barbie fashion well done my lady well done,0.891,positive
73,DanLawson146,3-Aug-23,positives1 ryan gosling completely steals the film for me hes hilarious but also completely sells the emotional moments too a great performance 2 the film had several moments that made me laugh out loud a lot of the humour is very clever as can be expected from these two great writers i should also say that i think the emotional moments were written very well too particularly barbie and kens breakup at the end which i thought was the best scene in the film 3 the production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective oscarsnegatives1 there are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me examples include the chase scene in the mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2 the message whilst respectable in a way was just far too on the nose for me at times when it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3 the film felt quite dated for me if this had came out in the 90s or 2000s i feel like it wouldve been much more impactful and relevant whereas nowadays not many kids play with barbie dolls and the maledominated society is nowhere near as prevalent,0.9969,positive
74,baybaysulzy,27-Jul-23,this movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience its amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human making it a refreshing watch it was funny visually stunning emotionally resonant and engaging im not sure why some have labeled it as preachy or agendadriven because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today if these aspects were challenging to watch that might have been the films intent  to resonate with its target audience i appreciate that the movie reminds us what barbies original purpose was to empower girls around the world so to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you werent the target audience anyway highly recommend,0.9726,positive
75,dililith,13-Aug-23,it is funny it is deep it is nostalgic it is not about romance it is all the things the doll was meant to bethe narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush womens selfesteemthe movie is entertaining  it makes you laugh has so many characters you barely get to appreciate all of them i dont particularly love gosling as ken i find him too old for the role but plays well the partnow the important thing about the movie is the concept the whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant it is light enough so you dont get an existencial crisis while watching it but youll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problemthat scene with the old lady is endearing the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener and ohh that final joke bonus points for that endingwill definitely what again,0.8694,positive
76,hyllus-01262,23-Jul-23,the first half was pretty enjoyable fun light but it took itself too seriously by the second half no longer allowing the talented cast especially gosling to shine and make us laugh it felt like the talents of will ferrell and michael cera were also somewhat underutilized interesting concept had potential but later in the movie it definitely started to fall flat for meryan gosling definitely held this movie together for me without the laughs he gave me it wouldve definitely been lower than 610 i think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie some is fine but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate it felt forced and out of place,0.9741,positive

78,mohamed-elbehairy,28-Jul-23,i found the movie to be refreshing but its far from perfectryan goslings performance was the best thing about the movie his sequences were the most memorable for me which is something i never expected myself to say his character ken also happened to be well writtenon the other hand barbie was a disappointing character margot robbie was good enough even though there was nothing special about her performance she wasnt the problem its just her arc was weakly written the motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable her development at the end did not make sense she wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours during which she didnt go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end she didnt even save the day her owner did it felt like barbie was a supporting character in her own movieken stole the show for the most part also the song im just ken should be nominated for the academys best original song award its just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creativethe story overall could have been better,0.9869,positive
79,elihebdon,22-Jul-23,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man lm in my 20s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,0.957,positive
80,D4V1D2411,6-Aug-23, i feel confused about this movie probably like a lot of people on one hand i laughed as i hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing but on the other hand while not being an antimen movie and actually trying to have a deep message it feels at some parts like a tantrum the way it handles its feminist message is not the best because while it tries to give a meaningful speach it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization i say almost because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not while being bad theyre not terrible but this makes it sound like a bad movie which barbie is not at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides it is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous when you have a movie thats like that all the time i dont think it matters all that much and at the end of the day i took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me an enjoying fun time that is worth watching,0.9643,positive
81,afuschiaperfume,25-Jul-23,i knew this was going to be political going in but i thought its barbie so i could overlook it but it was too much i do not enjoy politics in movies whether its left or right i expected it to be more fun and feel good and it was for some parts but not enough at all ryan was great and so was margot but i did not understand why barbie didnt like ken its wildly known that barbie loves ken and ken loves barbie its iconic and it made no sense for everything else in barbie land to be accurate but not that another problem was the writing it was very told and not shown as well as wordy the scenery was great as well as the costumes but the story could have been so much better like barbie and ken take l a on a fun adventure and some selfdiscovery but it wasnt really like that the ending was confusing does barbie want to have a baby,0.9927,positive
82,jamalb-38618,29-Jul-23,i watched this movie expecting something else but after the movie was finished i was not expecting so much humor emotional rollercoasters and a lot of barbies with kens the last scene where barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears i felt different in the heart as well the soundtrack was also amazing as well i just wish that there could be more barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales if not blame mattel lol the mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up i couldnt have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer,0.9914,positive
83,ilikelickingeyeballs,23-Jul-23,the colors shots houses clothes were really amazingly done margot and rayan were amazing beautiful and acted well i will say that i find that the movie wasnt that good the story wasnt as entertaining as it could this was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but i didnt find most of the jokes funny i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle i wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more the ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters ken is a cool character i gotta say he deserves the world and to really find something more about him so i wouldnt say it was a bad movie its okay to watch more casually more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia i was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta sayps i find it weird that this is considered such a woke movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls once like cmon i had a barbie too,0.9788,positive
84,anniebleasdale-97708,23-Jul-23,unfortunately most reviews that ive read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film it is not antimen it does not portray men as stupid take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century  oh yes just as ken is here the movie exaggerates this yes that is the point to clearly and humourously highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed stop being offended by something that isnt offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watchedthe film was fun emotional moving sad and empowering in many ways i must admit i hadnt expected to enjoy this film but wow what a surprise,0.8997,positive
85,jfgibson73,25-Sep-23,i thought the storyline of this movie was not well structured the first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor we see barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life when she decides to go to the real world it disrupts life for the residents of toyland we also learn that many girls resent barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females then the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the barbie world and treating the women poorly so now there are two competing storylines and as the characters work to resolve both issues we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself it gets very muddled and isnt much fun at this point i thought they should have kept it simple because they seemed to be on the right track early on,0.2462,positive
86,threenails10,20-Jul-23,its really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films i caught references to fight club 2001 space odyssey lego movie and others i cant think of at the moment but yeah this was a special film i dont think as many people will like it as it probably deserves but i did love most of it sometimes the tones felt off at times but its definitely recommended to see the satire works great here and the production design cinematography and acting intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects are all perfectly done here though overall the music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the lego movie in some ways ryan gosling and margot robbie are both pitch perfect here as well definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance i wouldnt say this is a family movie but i think families with older kids would work perfectly for this not sure this will be in the oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs,0.9961,positive

99,enigma49,20-Jul-23,first of all margot robbie is great in the role of barbie and i also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish both the pink dominated barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinionunfortunately there isnt much more to the movie than that the story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women thats it thats allthe story revolves around the word patriarchy with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween none of which really worked for me whats left is the empty feeling of lost potentialthe main plot element of the first few minutes the fact that barbie suddenly isnt perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection that sounds interesting right is almost completely ignored in favor of what i pointed out above the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this perfect barbieland in the first case yes theres the running gag with will ferrell as a ceo and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best it will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story if youre lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mindthen in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues how can anyone enjoy this 410 for the style and the acting,0.9867,positive

112,EUyeshima,15-Aug-23,theres a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director greta gerwig manages with stylish aplomb she and partner noah baumbach have taken the barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time however this is neither a treatise nor a polemic its still primarily a fun freewheeling farce with dayglo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective margot robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical barbie ryan gosling gives ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity the rest of the cast appear equally game gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candycoated girlhood memory,0.8885,positive
113,olcare,11-Aug-23,theres so much to say about the movie so many points to touch on that i dont know how to express it correctlylet me start by discussing a few parts that i really liked first of all ryan goslings performance was amazing it overshadowed everything in the film a masterful and remarkable performance while not margot robbies best performance she did quite well too i didnt find the other actors or actresses quite as impressiveanother aspect i found impressive was the costumes in my opinion the film definitely deserved an oscar for them they were the best costumes ive seen in a long time similarly the color coordination was superbi also enjoyed the production most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint the comedy in the film was of good quality and there were scenes that i really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watchingnow moving on to the things i didnt like and the area id like to emphasize the most  the screenplay after watching a strong first half i became very invested in the movie but the ending suffocated me trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless the film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner i understood the message but i ended up leaving the theater feeling frustratedin addition theres a part i absolutely disliked barbies convincing kens with their beauty and then reclaiming barbie land it felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie it definitely could have been written more cleverly moreover the metaphorical scene of classic barbie talking to the creator metaphorically and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed it was emotional yes but personally it felt heavyin short summing up the technical aspects and acting the film scored a 65 to 7 from me however the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed women are our treasures we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other lets love one another lets love our women  they are our mothers they are all invaluable and so are we hopefully one day everyone will be equal just like barbies aim and you can achieve your goals just like ken doesnote regardless of everything people should stop comparing barbie and oppenheimer  barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign and its necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts,0.9952,positive

121,isabellacatgirl,8-Aug-23,as someone who played with the dolls growin upthe injokes and references to some rare barbie variations and playsets are funny the political message gives barbie a new dimension i never thought would go to i felt a hidden antiwar message in it actually which is deep for a toy i never thought would be taken that serious makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchises historybut on rewatch ill fast forward to the cheesy funny parts would i watch it again probably especially after eating a pot cookiebet this movie would look crazier after watching i feel im on a barbie kick and searching for the toys,0.6124,positive
122,Imaculata,30-Jul-23,the barbie movie is a very mixed bag it tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor margot robbie does a fantastic job as barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of barbies world where its houses are all open and have no stairs and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries all that works fantastic but mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo which makes for a strange mix it isnt until after the first act where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys that it kind of falls apartthe barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience even men to think about but if you are a male viewer and if all you took from this movie is that it hates men then you completely missed the point the movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be it pokes fun at it while never completely turning against barbie as a product this is a barbie movie after all that this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film is a good thing including criticizing gender stereotypes but the execution leaves more to be desiredthere is plenty to critique about the barbie movie that is valid the barbie movie tries to do a lot of things and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess the movie could have benefited from a bit more focus instead it is all over the placejust the plot of barbie and ken being confronted with the real world probably would have been enough for a whole movie but to the movies credit it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a barbie movie i would argue too muchtheres the plot of mattel trying to capture barbie with the awkwardness of a mattel product what this movie is critiquing mattel it never feels entirely earnestthen theres the plot of barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her this plot works the best but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going onthen theres the side plot of barbie meeting her creator which at first feels like a random easter egg but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie without really fitting in with all the other plots the barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not at first it seems as if barbieland is the place that is magical and unrealistic which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor once barbie and ken visit the real world the contrast leads to more humor but then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world and things become very messy such as mattel having a mysterious floor where barbies deceased creator is still alive this is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line but that doesnt quite explain it either the movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building it was a side plot we didnt need in the first placethen there is the plot of ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes and then bringing all that back to barbieland this plot feels a bit disjointed it ends up dragging the third act back to barbieland when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act everything with barbie trying to make the other barbies remember who they are and revisiting ugly barbie should have been cut it feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going onall in all it is a bit of a mess storywise this script could have used a bit more editing also it ends on a joke about barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist which is a bit of low hanging fruit when you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls this is probably not the line should end on suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more senseas a comedy movie you cant aim for a high bar story wise when your movies comedy is aiming for the lowest bar it doesnt seem to work,0.8274,positive

125,justakidwritingreviews,9-Aug-23,i saw this movie right now and mostly enjoyed it the good parts are really enjoyable but sometimes i was just bored i really dont know how they did it but near the end of the movie some scenes were the peak of cinema and some were just uninterestingthey arent subtle with the politics the political stuff is very preachy but my biggest complain about the political stuff is that the movie is not entertaining when they bring it upi expected a funny quirky movie but i got to learn about political stuff which wasnt that good however the movie is good when they dont talk about it,0.1971,positive

127,lvsargeant,2-Aug-23,honestly its ryan gosling that made this movie for me and no not just the holy cow hot body hes got such a great sense of humour so funny him and simu liu just bounced off each other so well its a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh im still trying to understand will ferrells character though it was very lame and i know hes supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for methe sets and the costumes were fantastic exactly how i imagined my barbie used to live i think they could have dug a little deeper and done multiera costumes regardless it was just a lot of fun to watch,0.9682,positive
128,julietteshinta,11-Aug-23,barbie made a strong start really loved the characters loved the production design and love love the acting of margot robbie and ryan gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusingcertain characters portraying mattel exec were added in but in the end they dont really represent anything because their characters doesnt evolve and for me it feels to forced to put mattel in there as a character because of course the would like to look like they are neutral or even a solution to which we thought was a problem however since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question do we really need to see the mattel executives in hereit certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated convoluted and confusing for general folks like me is it really satire or is it not why are the kens treated like secondclass citizens at the end and why the barbies,0.9712,positive
129,brodyderek,5-Nov-23,the barbie movie left me with a deep sense of disappointment in my cinematic journey from my perspective the film failed to captivate and provide an entertaining experience and its storyline appeared to lack depth and substance regrettably it seemed to target a younger demographic leaving little to engage more mature viewersin agreement with my sentiments my mother shared a similar disinterest in the movie finding it more irksome than enjoyable the overwhelming acclaim and popularity of barbie remain a puzzling enigma to me as i perceive the film as overrated and lacking the qualities that should warrant such fervent admiration,0.9176,positive
130,nathanholt-67152,21-Jul-23,i think i laughed maybe twice michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here nothing made sense there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch i think it was supposed to be comedic there was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of manly overall it was just super weird and not that funny,0.8803,positive
131,luffha,23-Jul-23,i loved the music  and the fun starta bit of cheeky humor  and dance choreographythe story was quite confusing it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end  the ending was quite weird  and switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense  the character from the mattel management did not add any value to the story  if they were edited out  i think no one would even notice a difference the main male character has done a good job  especially in his macho phase the female main character was lovely  absolutely gorgeous and well played ,0.9645,positive
132,Sh31kh_H0kv5,7-Sep-23,no way on earth this was possible but thats the thing it was possible that the actual barbie movie was so inspiring that i just had to make it the movie of my month despite all odds theres like no way im hell that it would surprise any one all the hype worth it all the praise worth it and behold all the stars worth it everything barbie is just golden sorry platinum just to be precised in my opinion its like am the only one who feels this way but thinking about how awesome all the connections sums up its just so magical from the story to the history infact just see this movie am a feminist so thats all thee more reason,0.9658,positive
133,mDanHam,11-Nov-23,the opening sequence is such a precise deadon parody of 2001 a space odyssey that i had to give that segment alone an a which factored in to my overall rating and upped it a notch actually the first fortyfive minutes to an hour of barbie is pretty funny with some good satire and surprisingly dark undertones like stereotypical barbie mysteriously having thoughts about death so that helped tooproblem is when barbie  ken margot robbie  ryan gosling journey to the real world the social commentary turns too serious and practically grinds the movie to a halt sometimes youre not sure if its still parody or if theyre trying to make a statement and that pretty much takes the fun out of itbarbie is best when it makes fun of all prevailing gender stereotypes instead of zeroing in on how women are oh so burdened being as they are unfairly expected to be all things to all people  yada yada yada giving the former ugly betty america ferrera an opportunity to lecture us on the subject by delivering a preachy monologue there are a few noteworthy moments in the second half involving a ken insurrection a kensurrection perhaps and a side note on barbies origin with a nod to the dolls reallife creator ruth handler rhea perlman but by then the damage has been donewatch the first hour for incisive clever satire after that beware of banality or if youre a movie buff at least watch the first five minutes,0.8259,positive

135,bobbygordon-92171,24-Jul-23,the movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end the beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off margot robbies feet the movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but i felt like it had too much hype also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was will ferril the villain or was ken there were just somethings that didnt need to be in this greta gerwig is a great director wonder woman proves that its just this movie could have been different i manley started reenjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle sorry if i have wasted your time but thats my opinion,-0.2846,negative
136,frisoflorentinus,19-Jul-23,i was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and i have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non barbie fan barbie is the role robbie was clearly born to play ryan gosling and simu liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines  barbie is a brilliantly executed incredibly fun brightly colored completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season ultimately barbie is so many things a stereotype a toy an idea a vessel of imagination a cultural relic but in gerwigs trusted hands this is barbie like youve never seen her before,0.944,positive

138,daniel-smits-03179,21-Jul-23,barbie was an entertaining movie but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film the messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird the movie also meandered from place to place and didnt seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run timeryan gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in several of the cameos were also greathad fun but wouldnt really recommend it as a must watch mostly watched it as the first part of the barbenheimer meme so it was worth it for that reason at least710,0.9187,positive

anything no this movie doesnt hate men if anything it understands mens struggles just as much as womens i was scared that the movie whould demonizes ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from with him always being in barbies shadows and all thatspeaking of barbie margot robbie is the perfect barbie she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action barbie and look im not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now its the one i liked the most",0.9852,positive
140,SexyActorsJunkie,24-Jul-23,i went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because come on who is more perfectly beautiful to portray barbie than margot robbie and whos more attractive to be ken other than ryan goslingthis movie was too long too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children which is odd since its about the most iconic doll of all timethe creation of the barbie world was awesome sets and props but the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didnt impress and neither did the resolution of the story how about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble also they didnt have to pointedly throw in that barbie was drinking cow milk cow on the label in all caps are the writers anti vegan at least they mentioned in the film to the audience that ken was wearing faux fur but it was like a condescending little note because i guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows anyways the best parts of this movie were ryan gosling all the way gorgeous funny singing and dancing the conflict between the two alpha kens and introducing me to simu liu and issa rae despite its flaws im glad i followed the hype and saw this movie but i doubt i could sit through it again its just too silly and canned preachy,0.9748,positive
141,spiderman-55910,17-Sep-23,the movie starts off great and has hilarious jokes throughout for me ryan gosling stole the show as he had the funniest lines and scenes some folks are mad about the womens empowerment themes not me men have treated women as less than equal since the dawn of time who are we to complain when they rightfully mock that i dont mind the shots at the patriarchy or even the fact that theres not one intelligent male character in the entire thing what i dont like about this movie is barbies existential crisis its like they forgot the audience majority are children and it feels like a pathetic bid for an oscar that arc was as offputting as it was unnecessary had that element been replaced with more humor or at least a wholesome resolution i wouldve given it a much higher score they just took it to a place where its less relatable for the children watching,-0.2725,negative
142,mollyt-73422,16-Aug-23,this movie is not for people who cry a lot it was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic goldstarting with barbie land it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy while the barbies are in control there is a lack of violence between the kens and the barbies the most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between ryan goslings ken and simu lius ken although the kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like beach which is a role reversal of the human world barbies entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see barbie spiral out of controlside note the whole concept of weird barbies house is amazing the discontinued barbies and kens are hilarious especially when you realise their backstoriesthen the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through we also see barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit this is when ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more the sequences in the human world arent as interesting as barbie world but still keep you hooked inthen going back to barbie world we see kens patriarchy unlike the barbies matriarchy it is completely toxic the barbies are all maids and stupid only ever caring for the kens and then the kens actually start a war with eachother over the barbies however the kens are actually stupid and clearly dont see what they want ryan goslings ken then explains to barbie that he didnt like how he was treated before and he doesnt like the world hes built for himself now and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world the barbies still run everything but they give the kens more opportunities the kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions this is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote nowfinally the ending where barbie is taken away by ruth is beautiful this made me cry the most watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out this movie is a masterpiece and deserves the oscar this year more than any other,0.3675,positive

145,mieriks,19-Jul-23,this movie about barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence is a good fantasy moviei liked the concept and it reminded me of the toy story quadrilogy 19952019 the dolls were living dolls but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours the sense of humor were present and i noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways its satire was well used and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime the attention to details was fantastic because of the script the action the minor details like eating and drinking and last but not least the sets and the effects  every visual element basically the characters behaviors were like they were controlled by kids but we didnt see the kids hands or like that they acted like they were played with and that was well executed i thinki think the story was alright the outer story in the first and third act was good the beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of barbie and how barbie has affected people before but also how barbie should affect us in the right way today its all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others shoes because thats how to live as a realistic selfcontrolled being the second act is a big part of a movie and i got mixed feelings about that act in this movie it had its meanings but i think much of what happened especially in los angeles was sometimes messy and unnecessary it was much smalltalk and i sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time anyway it didnt ruin the overall experiencein conclusion this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story the attention to detail from the script to the visual elements enhances the overall experience the movies satirical approach appeals to both children and adults making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences while the outer story is wellcrafted the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing nevertheless the movies exploration of barbies impact on peoples lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable despite minor flaws the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others,0.9977,positive
146,gilliandawe91,10-Aug-23,wow i saw this movie on july 23rd and ive been thinking about it ever since right off the bat the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design the backdrops the houses all of the set decoration in barbieland is perfection all of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative i would love to believe that barbie can help usher in a new era where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage without so much cgi set dec is 1010next i have to talk about greta gerwigs clear love of cinema from the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001 a space odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed to a hilarious matrix reference and then the overarching clear love of old hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals the dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute blastthen there is the acting it almost feels wrong to say it but theres no denying that ryan gosling steals every scene he is in his comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we havent gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty margot robbie is absolute perfection the most obvious casting for barbie ever in the history of the world but dont let that fool you her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here she really is one of the best actor of this generation the rest of the cast also absolutely kills it america ferrera simu liu kate mckinnon michael cera will farrell etc etc etc everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance acting is 1010the music it is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original barbie album for this film im not always a hard pop music kind of person but it went so perfectly with this film that i had to order myself a vinyl copy but best of all ryan goslings performance in im just ken the dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious i can only pray that it is nominated for best original song at the oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem can you imagine it music is 1010and finally the script see how i managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on this script is hilarious so smart and witty and deeply poignant and emotional it hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years i love that even though barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywherei personally did not find that to be the case for me i was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll all of her careers the fact that there was an astronaut barbie before there was a woman working at nasa etc then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy if anything in this movie seemed false or offended you i dont even know what to tell you this felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman so many women have shared america ferreras monologue and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie and i say that as a big matchbox twenty fanall in all this movie for me is a masterpiece its stunning hilarious emotional and the most fun i may ever have had in a movie theatre cannot recommend strongly enough easily my favourite movie of 2023 cant imagine how anything else could come close,0.9993,positive

150,osianwiliam,24-Jul-23,amazing to watch and delved into womanhood using incredible references weird barbie was such a humorous touch but every part of humour managed to add to the true meaning of the film even weird barbie highlighted how barbie was exploited by some users for their enjoyment using her ridiculing and yet shes seen as ugly despite the true fun and amusement shes brought to the world amazing soundtrack aswell though i felt some songs couldnt be heard very well at all amazing performance from margot robbie but as helen mirren said she was the wrong person to cast for sympathy during that scene where she calls herself ugly,0.7964,positive
151,jjankel123,22-Jul-23,honestly not too sure what my partner and i were expecting but we figured it would be a fun empowering and sweet movieinstead we got a preachy confused mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring wayunfortunately i think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience the message seems dated and naive at best its a bit of an eye roll at worst its an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought processacting sound track set design and some bits of comedy were really good and there is some genuine cinema in there,0.8484,positive
152,yeswestan,25-Aug-23,leading up to the day i went to see this movie i avoided as much advertising as i could as to avoid spoilers and go in entirely blind but that being said i learned very late that greta gerwig was the director of this film and therefore was not prepared for the emotional journey i was about to be taken throughthis movie was unique creative fun and so special the music was excellent the cast was wonderful the costumes were amazing it was funny and the choreography was funas for its flaws this movie did have some uneven pacing i felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary namely most of the mattel chase sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential the ending felt abrupt and there was little justice by the end of the movie though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless feminist fighti was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience from growing up to objectification by men i was shocked to see ken claim to love barbie only to objectify and hurt her later on it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and i enjoyed it a loti didnt expect to cry during the fun silly barbie movie i had been so excited to see but im glad it was as emotional as it was,0.9966,positive
153,ianshumway,22-Jul-23,for starters this movie was made by women for women i was not the intended audience which is fine but i feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here or there could have been one that everyone could have really likedthe movie is well made i could tell that the people who made the movie liked barbie and knew their stuff and that bleed into the movie it has a cool set lots of creative choices and has good actors with some genuinely funny gags and jokesthe cons some movies are great pieces of art where you cant nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say the classic disney movies like beauty and the beast peter pan pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themesthen there some films like atlas shrugged where you know exactly what its trying to say from the getgo this is one of the those films except it doesnt just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another this film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it upi dont think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be and it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical and all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way there was even this car chase scene in middle which i believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for chevroletalso there were some very weird parts of the movie where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways ill just give one example and finish on that at the end barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have but she is wrong everything she listed werent women problems they were people problems thats life i sorry but its not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss go talk to machiaveli these are problems everyone hasanyway thats my review i hope its balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is ,0.9918,positive
154,boyd-03573,13-Sep-23,the good  its bright and colourful  rhea pearlman shows genuine heart  helen mirren is fine as the narrator  the bad  i didnt laugh once this is a complete wet rag as a comedy in fact it is not better than an epitome of mediocrity in all departments and it is embarrassingly over sentimental in places   the music is dreadful you cant tell one piece from another  if this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days  then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards hollywood ai probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them  you need to learn that if you write stuff to satisfy the cultures all around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest then you write stuff that doesnt satisfy anyone  this had immense possibilities but instead turned out to be a geriatric barbie who had lost her dentures,0.0482,neutral
155,sandy777,21-Nov-23,barbie a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends what could go wrong a lot apparently it started with voice over narration and went downhill from there there was too much telling rather than showing most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how i should feel about it the writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles there were some funny moments but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle i never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing the story lacked stakes i didnt care about barbie or ken in the right hands this movie could have been fun but barbie didnt seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell,0.791,positive

158,anthonywltrs,21-Jul-23,this movie wow just wow this was unlike anything i had expected going in to seeing barbie earlier today i figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between barbie and ken with it ending with them getting together beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterboy was i wrong holy moly barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking at least to me it was deep and thought provoking i mean seriously this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times but the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following  self identity discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life it is ok to be imperfect to be weird kooky dark its ok to not live up to anyones expectations in life or those around you just be you and only you self love willing to accept change even if you dont like it theres also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixits funny heartwarming filled with unexpected surprises and im sure for all the hardcore barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant moviemargot robbie and ryan gosling did an exceptional job as barbie and ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time ryan gosling as ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as ken,0.9931,positive
159,abeburnett,21-Jul-23,oppression is a state of mind even when objectively you are oppressedthe biggest problem with this movie is that it leans hard into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by men as if were some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugatedtalk about intellectually lazy and the only acceptable man is an allen wimpy effeminate man this movie couldve provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes or how men and women complement each other but no instead in the final act it chooses sides and the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side the equity side the side of well do unto others as you feel in your hyperoppressed feeling state theyve done unto you you feel like the kens have done you wrong so you oppress them in return never mind the barbies oppressed the kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie and the entirety of the first act but no the kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay equity demands retribution so all men excuse me kens must paywhile i laughed and enjoyed the first two acts in the end i felt thoroughly disappointed angry nauseated if they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it wouldve been a 1010 but they couldnt resist making it propaganda i guess the jokes on me for taking our girls to italso theres a monologue in the third act which couldve been brilliant if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how all humans feel not just women men too every man ive ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society from women from other men its not just a woman thingoh and then the last 510 minutes or so were almost like a different movie it just didnt line up with who barbie was and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occurin the end this ken me cannot recommend this film to other kens unless youre the kind of liberal  progressive man who believes the whole women are oppressed narrative then youll probably love it every other guy though or the women who love them id recommend taking a pass on this one or watch the first 75 and then leavebottom line this is every bit as toxic as some forms of masculinity this is just toxic feminism and i say that as a feminist,0.9106,positive

163,zoeyrea,27-Jul-23,i have seen this film in theaters twice now and i can safely say that i thought it was amusing entertaining and fun however i wont lie to you and say that its really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim while this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow i am not saying that this wasnt a great film as said before it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a good movie with now i cant say that i wasnt entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something the longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient people that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and womens issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner however i feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone the creators of barbie stated that this was an everyone movie that this film was designed to cater to all viewers but did it have to the laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message dont get me wrong all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation even after watching the movie twice i still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of barbieland where is this really set why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world why do barbies know theyre toys i might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused overall i think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating i really didnt want this movie to be below a 9 i was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to do anything to see it in theaters again but it turned out to be just ok a word i can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic but it just fell flat in that department would i recommend yeah why not but would i jump at the opportunity to see it again ever probably not,0.976,positive
164,SoumikBanerjee1996,10-Nov-23,when the execution banks on shrewd humour and clever writing the movie thrives as a vivid spectacle as a lighthearted entertainer but whenever it delves deeper than the surface and enthusiastically seeks for the hidden underlayers the psyches of barbie and ken their understanding of the world and their impaired perspectives the output just becomes so much fuller the film comes to be something else altogetherhowever the emotionally motivated instants seldom come out in the open as the narrative for the most part leans on the fun humorous side and frankly speaking it was bound to be like thatafter all its a feature that is made mainly by keeping younger audiences in mind its just that greta is a great storyteller and i think highly of her directorial skills thus i expected to see more of her,0.9866,positive

166,billygonzalez-48596,22-Jul-23,barbie was a very funny and cute movie however the movie had more fluff than substance the plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing lego movie and barbie goes to the real world on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there the movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach i say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots instead we got a monologue from america ferreras character telling us the problems but never showing us any for this reason i feel it was hard to build a connection with barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie there was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters the kens never truly got a resolution like the writers couldnt come up with a good solution will farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie overall it was a very funny movie but not a very solid one the message felt like it was preached rather than shown the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like i was watching a super bowl half time commercial,0.9623,positive
167,walfordior,30-Jul-23,barbie is no longer just a toy rather this idea of barbie has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time it is so much more than merely a toy it will not longer be just a toyi must admit as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing i had my doubts so many things scanned through my head one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a comedy and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me boy was i wrongwhere do i startto start off with this is not just a comedy movie would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedythis movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot a plot that touches everyones heart a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the moviebarbie focuses on the story of stereotypical barbie  ken barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue when reading this plot it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy action simple film etc however this is only the plot the storyline is very differentthe opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood stereotypes a new generation etc with barbie margot robbie appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film it is is symbolic in the sense that the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with it may also represent girls smashing or declining their dreams due to female stereotypes a topic that is heavy in this film  i liked that gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightlygood comedic scenes are present throughout the film such as the jokes about alan however even though alan being on his own and not many people caring about alan are seen as comedy  i feel that there is much more behind alan and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier and that gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall that being alan may represent women in the sense that in this maledominant world women are constantly feeling pressured and alone and not listened toi like how gerwig didnt make a whole new concept of barbie this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity i particularly liked how when barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car this was symbolic as when young children play with barbies that is how they get their barbie doll down too they bring the barbie down as if it is floating i really liked this detail had innocence to itfurther on in the movie the topics start to get heavier for example when barbie meets sasha sasha described first world problems such as feminism here gerwig had suddenly brought in these topics without warning again i liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding womens rights and how quick this world is to judge womenkens storyline was also an intricate part of the movie the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on ken wanting to not just be ken and barbie but wanting to feel important in the end ken realises that he is important too gerwig does this really well although this movie highlights topics relating to womens rights the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal and that was a nice message to finish the film offthe ending montage of childhood barbies children etc was a really heartwrenching moment a great way to end the movie gerwig played with emotions here spectators started off the movie laughing and ended in crying great way to showcase opposing topicsall in all fantastic movie,0.9972,positive

175,hmbrisbo,26-Jul-23,this might just be the best movie ive ever seen the more i think about it the more i realize just how genius it is i mean they really thought out every little detailmy favorite part is that if you love this movie you get the movie and if you hate the movie you also get the movie it truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it its for everyoneid like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment we start off in a matriarchal society however its a society created by little girls so the barbies are not violent towards the kens they just arent obsessed with the kens the kens are just in the background this is representative of how children girls feel then we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society but not just any patriarchal society its a society created by adults so we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies then we go back to barbieland and ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him he creates a toxic meninist movement which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer we cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes the kens start to become violent even towards each other this is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world we cant even rely on each other sometimes women can be hateful towards each other as well finally the movie comes to a close with barbie taking a small step in the right direction she says it doesnt have to be barbie and ken its barbie and its ken now heres were people start to get pissed barbie just got done saying that the barbies and kens need to start living as equals but when when of the kens asks to be on the supreme court the president barbie says no thats too far lets start with maybe a cabinet member or something wow how could they just kidding youre supposed to be angry about this this is an accurate representation of the real world the movie literally ends with the barbie world being an exact replica of the real world only with the gender roles reversedanother thing id like to point out is that even ken says at the end that he didnt really like patriarchy anyway he just wanted to ride horses again this is because he is a doll in a world created by children i think theres a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the pov of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything even mattel is kind of shown as a bad guy in the movie but even they say they didnt make barbie for her to become a sexualized standard they made barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother with barbie they can be anything they want to be it wasnt until adults came along and taught us to sexualize barbie that we started to hold her to a different standardi think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it i think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it every person ive see criticizing this movie im like youre so close to the point youre basically running head first into it that is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie its a trap you cant say hateful things about it without proving the point of the movie,0.7437,positive

180,mgumsley,16-Aug-23,this film had to be more than advertising mattels famous doll which set the standard for playthings fiftyodd years ago and getting greta gerwig to direct a movie about barbie seems to have been a creative masterstroke as expected she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes muchderided doll and its a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightlyit looks spectacular with barbieland depicted with so much pink it could be nauseating but the camera is moved around very skilfully so that images are fleeting with most of the characters being ken or barbie it is easy to follow and the audience knows that margot robbie and ryan gosling are the pair to followthe plot is simple enough with barbie suffering a trauma that causes her to visit the real world where some shattering illusions cause her to rethink her role as a female icon robbie is stunning in this role she has always shone in playing over the top characters and barbie has given her plenty of scope for this she is matched by a superb ryan gosling clearly enjoying playing a downtrodden male who gets a chance to avenge his status and the rest of the cast are all good as well particularly america ferrera as a mattel employee who sees through the barbie dream and will ferrell being the usual will ferrell as the boss of matteli really enjoyed the film but the second part was somewhat overlong gerwig also couldnt resist getting into a preachy mode as the ending approached i docked two stars for that but otherwise this film was the tonic the film industry needed there have been too many mediocre films lately this isnt one of them,0.99,positive
181,mateosilie,28-Aug-23,lets start with what i enjoyed the scenery costumes and music were very nice but i believe that this movie was way overhyped i expected barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few funny jokes here and there instead i was greeted with an overly dramatic some would say cringey movie that sounds badly written it seems that this movie doesnt fit in any category it is definitely not a drama nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable but for the wrong reason the moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated but just isnt suited for this type of movie a pink doll travelling between the barbie world and the real world wasnt enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women if you are not into barbie this movie is definitely not for you,0.9697,positive
182,themurphys-11710,26-Jul-23,great visuals but the plot felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadnt really thought through a real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing societys gendered expectations for both men and women instead the writers chose our existing system  but with women in charge  as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative this was not a kids film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic i fell for the marketing campaign though it it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket but the bait and switch nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed,-0.311,negative
183,chadwick-86955,17-Aug-23,barbie is such a unique movie it will probably become a very popular movie at least a cult movie great songs  it was a musical at times  great talents the jokes were embedded everywhere in the movie the phrases the tshirts the signs i will have to watch the movie again to pickup on more of themthe movie starts with the individual issues with barbie and ken and then kens feelings for barbie and the lack of feelings that barbie has for kenthey are dolls so some of the premise of the movie is really inconsistent  and so many people including myself are trying to latch on aspects of the movie that they want to champion folks are now getting serious about the movie and its messages those folks must be too young to have gone through the 70si am not a movie fanatic so i am not aware of the possible meanings that the writersdirectors hadimo this is a gynocentric film but it is supposed to be a spoof the barbie environment was created in a time of typical malewomen roles but exploited to an extreme barbie was always slim white and had some room for possible growth ken was a complete airbrain only to accompany barbie possibly so she wouldnt look like a promiscuous womanmy daughter had no desire to play with dolls especially barbies nor did i want her to she had her favorite doll not a barbie but it was more of a companion she was not its mother my son did not play with toy soldiers he had no interest in them nor did i want him to nor playing with toy guns probably not for the typical reasons when he got older it was limited to lasertag with a clear distinction from realitythe movie skips around with kens understanding of his lack of value barbies lack of affection for him barbie and ken then learn about the real world barbie of course is devastated when she finds that real women dont have the same life as in barbieland where women control the world in real life they dont do anything they have no influencepower important jobs which can include just about anything and are completely and utterly controlled by men right that is realistic the kens find a completely different life as well they actually can act like idiotsthe kens then go off on some idiotic campaign to overthrow the barbies  stupid but funny great musical numbers the kens have been ignored for years the barbies objectified this is when the film goes off on a gynocentric bent only concentrating on the oppression that barbies have had forget the kensthe film apparently wants to get more philosophicalgenuine at the end this is ridiculous there are booths at the theatre where photos can be taken merchandise purchased etc this is nothing more than a moneymaking opportunity keeping the same ideas so now girls should be supporting this theme getting pictures taken with barbie wearing the pastel pink clothing that has been proven medically as causing epilepsy a joke  i am not sure what new information the movie has for folks  if any reading comments some folks are actually considering the movie to exposing the problems of today i hope society has progressed a bit further than the original barbie concept for both the barbies and the kensthis movie will become a cult classic,0.5626,positive
184,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,10-Aug-23,in my view theres two ways to watch  interpret barbie first watch it with a critical eye about how mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to normalise barbie second just have fun both work it is genius quite frankly mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that theyll be quids in with a new flat footed barbieyou should watch it and work out where you stand to refuse to watch it because its about a doll is missing the point in my view its a great movie to just watch and have fun with but equally you could watch it with a critical eye and work out where you stand,0.4767,positive

190,kezerian-casey,23-Jul-23,i think barbie has always been about women empowerment and im glad theres a barbie movie that doesnt tiptoe around it to spare feelings this movie was not marketed towards kids it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with barbie its an important message and it was told well the cinematography was also incredible loved the costumes the casting everything about it margot played a literal perfect barbie i loved the scene where she was supposed to be ugly and the narrator made a joke about margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as ken even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable,0.9665,positive

194,lucasferreracoimbra,1-Aug-23,the barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea using scenery that rivals classics like playtime and a cast that was clearly handpicked with stars like margot gosling and farrell the movie features an astonishing soundtrack including ice spice dua lipa tame impala billie and much more barbies presentation is topnotch and some might even say it couldnt be any better i wouldve agreed however the writing itself doesnt quite match its other impressive traits despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed this led the director to piece together a selfexploration story with a modern world outlook topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective with a side dish of a womanly critique of society safe to say not every point got across as intendedthe plot starts in barbie land where we witness robbies characters journey and her existential quest concerned for her designated childs fate due to the villainous scholiosis the tall blonde takes action the movies second part shifts to reallife segments offering hilarious situations with ken  barbie the perfect doll believes shes found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land nobody admires loving barbies and the kens are the ones in control in contrast the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia after finding her true partner in the childs mother and returning to barbie land the toy discovers its destruction under a horseloving mojo dojo casa house living and beerdrinking government with a pep talk from her former playmate she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl powerand this without the inclusion of matel and the ending it tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes but it has the wings of icarus represented by its 2hour runtimethe main three themes are the search for ones self the media prying on those who are deeply insecure and the question of womanhoods position in society however not all themes were treated equally the search for ones self for example had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others becoming weird as the movie put it and ending with the pursuit of reality not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully on the other hand the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end taking away from the main conflictthe movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between barbie and the child of her owner showing that barbie isnt as glorious as she felt however after this nothing truly develops the kid joins the journey and sees that barbie is a woman just like her which doesnt really correlate with anything before that to be honest it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing but i guess that is what solves the big kenland problem the middle ground gets taken by the character arc of ken and his performance steals the show but the way its solved pretty much trivializes the issue ken was facing making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to men are big dumbdumbs is extremely unfortunate as it was in my opinion the most interesting part of the movie however you cant really rival i am just ken partsomething even more unfortunate was farrells character hes such a good actor but he was incredibly wasted in this role i understand that its a barbie movie and kids will be there and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles however couldnt they you know not put farrell his role doesnt really scream expertise and other than that they arent even plotrelevant i feel like if they just cut this part entirely the movie would have had a lot more to gain besides the movie is pg13 so they dont really need to consider slapstick comedy sorry for offending mr bean fansin conclusion the barbie movie is surprisingly more than kenough it provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances however it didnt deliver that well in its plot points i wouldnt say its a mustsee but you might be missing out if you dont watch it,0.9878,positive
195,atomeckova,23-Jul-23,to me barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men i wasnt really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time it pains me how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and funmen aside i do think it healed something in me however clich it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it would definitely show it to my future daughter if i planned to have one i think its an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else 3,0.877,positive

197,yftdmvzz,5-Aug-23,this is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever the plot is forgettable and alot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate the kens were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them also the barbies had no objection to the kens instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought they were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side characters superficial problems to bring them to their senses these issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly the movie has some plus points being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8 ratings an excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter wait for this one to release on dvd or streaming platforms,-0.8836,negative

199,Jithindurden,21-Jul-23,barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved an existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described its very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable great message even if it gets preachy a little bit which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too it also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition the selfawareness works to a point too but the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless i mean i get it that mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this,0.9887,positive
200,huey2088,11-Aug-23,i was never into barbie as a child because i thought shes just a boring toy the operative word being  toy so when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist sky high beauty standards white skin and blonde hair i thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because theyre just jealous at someone elses success its easier to blast someone elses hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing itthe way children perceive toys remain unchanged a young child who picks up a barbie will not immediately think if at all they must aspire to have the dolls physique children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination they dont think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy the politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest ruth handler created barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll she wasnt into politics or trying to change cultural standardsgerwigs barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many many lectures to the masses the movie looks like its for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite this is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control pointing out that its a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiotsthe portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping barbie robbie goes into the real human world and shes heckled by men at the beach and if thats not a clear enough message she visits a construction site where you guessed it the men starts to make derogatory comments as well then theres the mattel hq where its of course run by men in suits who are naturally idiots one of the lower ranked male employee swindells even say im a man with no power does that make me a woman whats with half of the sex education actors cast in this movie the brilliant ncuti gatwa playing a hetero kenat just under two hours you can guess why that is  theres not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point youre wondering if this is a movie or a music channel the second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boringrobbie and gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given barbie is an iconc doll and thats all she is a toy  so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining and in case youre so numb from all the preachiness the trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many isms as possible by using barbie as a prop,0.9375,positive

212,liefie2000,20-Jul-23,how did i go to watch barbie only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health the plot made no sensefor someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics it was a disappointment most women like to watch feelgood chick flicks as an escape from reality and for the same reason girls like to watch barbie but it was nothing like that and instead i left the cinema feeling literally depressed as a little girl not a single part of me thought the old barbie movies presented a barbie who wasnt a strong figure and yes you can be strong while being in lovethe way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art but the plot made no sense despite them trying to constantly spoonfeed it to usin barbie land the women the barbies are in charge and have everything while the men the kens are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies they dont even have houses when barbie enters the real word she realises its the complete reverse youd think that barbie would then realise that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens then go back to barbie land and fix it instead when she goes back to see ken turning barbieland into kenland because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to manipulate the kens into fighting each other so they can take back their power then instead of apologising to ken who was genuinely in love with her and had no true bad intentions the entire movie  he thought the patriarchy was about horses about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds she simply apologises for not spending some time with him then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to find himself then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect  and i get what theyre trying to achieve here but i thought there would be a deeper reason perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable such as having empathy or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulitei get the intention of the movie but it really didnt have to be that deep i really just wanted to have fun at a barbie movie the last thing youd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women politics patriarchy death depression and anxiety the beginning of the film was fun but that fun didnt last long but people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals,0.8813,positive
213,fedepa_21,28-Jul-23,for sure would be better rated if there werent so many insecure men missing the entire point of the movie or rejecting it because it is not the same old narrative that has favoured only them until now i dont think is too preachy as other comments say is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day even ignoring the message it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows had great music good acting creativity good visuals all in all great movie i like that it didnt have a typical love story ending which would have ruined the whole point of the movie a fresh movie that is needed,0.9881,positive
214,valadas,2-Sep-23,this is the story of old doll barbie since many years ago but presented here as a young beautiful woman she is suffering a crisis about herself and her existence and wants to go to the real world to have it solved we see nice images from the real world and the barbies world and see several other barbie doll types all along the movie this story develops itself by a lot of conflicts mainly because at a certain time her lover ken betrays her and tries to be the leader of barbies world which makes barbie and her allies to fight him and his followers till the end in several intricate scenes till he is defeated and barbie becomes a real woman with the help of ruth her creator not a particularly good movie in terms of story but technically excellent,0.0299,neutral
215,jasoncrespo-56276,8-Aug-23,honestly barbie turned out to be a pretty good film the concept was already a good one and the execution was really good the movie did feel a bit long though a few scenes that felt dragged out i like the mother and daughter they were like the audiences soul within the moviethe quote where mothers stand still to show their daughters how far theyve gonemade it was really beautiful my mother cried during that sceneryan gosling shined a lot during this film and i liked that since he represented men in a way opinionoverall really super enjoyable movie for all ages more so for the adults in my opinion great message for the barbies and the kens of our real world,0.9881,positive
216,micheleiodice,13-Sep-23,a very confusing plot underdeveloped characters and a haughty attitude to glorify the plastic doll in all possible ways mixing patriarchy feminism womens rights gender equality sex etc etc mattel did everything they could to ruin a good concept but i am sorry its just a plastic dollthere are some interesting points like the emotions of barbie and ken when they visit the real world for the first time but they quickly move away from it and is not fully developed the way they move in the barbie world is it children moving them in the real world and speaking for them notdeveloped the weird doll what happened to her how does she feel notdeveloped the mother and daughter role whats their purpose notdeveloped the ceo and cfo whats their story whats their purpose notdeveloped that alain dude notdeveloped,0.6812,positive
217,661jda,26-Jul-23,this is not a great movie  when you get down to it its not even a good movie its a popcorn movie at best the best thing it has going for it margot robbie as barbie she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down you genuinely feel sorry for her at the other end of the scale  ryan gosling as ken gosling is good at stretching into roles but no matter what  ken was an androgenous doll and gosling cant stretch the role anything more than that he looks like a character out of zoolander and whenever he is on the screen i was cringing in my seat there are definitely funny moments my favorite when ken runs into the ocean to surf definitely a womans movie from the first preach to the final cast roll  it got old fast and the screenplay didnt seem to have much substance after the i am woman speeches i thought it was me but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well sorry greta  this is not your ticket to the oscars,0.9696,positive
218,miriamkheirom,6-Sep-23,i have been a barbie lover since i was a little girl and when i knew they were going to do a barbie movie i was really excited and looking forward to watch it especially after all the hype the attention and all the marketing and everything but i ended up being really really disappointed with the movie very boring movie from the beginning till the endthroughout the whole movie i just wanted the movie to be already over thats how bored i was and how much it wss not interesting i really got bored during the movie there was really nothing fun or exciting so yeah it was pretty disappointing,-0.9543,negative
219,kadiarula,10-Aug-23,barbie comes to life and is surprised by all the possibilities after a life predetermined she goes on an adventure in the real world with new friend madeline the film celebrates finding oneself and believing in ones potential with barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story the film takes barbie out of her traditional dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time this allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on barbies journey of selfdiscovery in a real world setting shes unfamiliar with,0.836,positive
220,PaperCoffins,22-Jul-23,i really dont know what to say about this movie  everything was colorful the humor was there  the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do  i went in there with low expectations because its a barbie film but i was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching  margot robbie as barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled  everybody had a good time  i should give this score maybe a bit higher but i just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together i was watching a parody episode of south park which is not a bad thing  i though it was the right direction for a movie called barbie  it was weird to me but in a very good way and lol at the ending  made everybody laugh  check it out  i say its worth a view in the theatre,0.9904,positive
221,drarzudogru,5-Aug-23,no movie ive seen lately has made me feel this happy i went to the theater thinking i was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy but as i watched the movie i started to think about what popular culture has done to people the costumes are exquisite the location designs are incredible makeup and jewelry design is perfect and the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie a movie for the summer months you feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home you are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world i thank everyone who contributed i hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second barbie movie will not be made,0.9788,positive
222,accountwell,24-Aug-23,started well including the scene where barbie removes her feet from her shoes and remains the same shape as per the trailer but after barbie and the characters were introduced the script began to lose its way as though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout if you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor dont expect too much i think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other actors were all good but the story just let them down hopefully not a trilogy on the way,0.97,positive
223,tfpdbbxck,25-Jul-23,i went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it when i exited the theatre i was shocked by how good of a film it was i didnt expect it to be so funny so well written i just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads as well as some of the references one of the most fun films of the year to experience especially if you are depressed after watching oppenheimer it has moments of sadness laughs and so much more overall 1010 great message great acting great movie,0.9894,positive
224,jgeorge4,22-Jul-23,this was a very fun very engaging premise i dont know if id call it groundbreaking since its a little derivative of toy story and extra guy but this definitely works the scenery and cast are great and the movie bristles with energyi just wish they kept this a little more lighthearted and a little less preachy there are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events but how many great comedies are there these days how about for once just keeping things light and entertaining the patriarchy seriouslyregardless i think most of the audience loved it and i think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the moms big speech its a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power and you will probably be glad you went,0.9946,positive
225,julian-heinz,7-Nov-23,i am a big movie fan and watch a wider variety of movies i sit through nearly every movie i begin watching because in most cases there is a twist or a catch at the end that explains weaknesses of the movie in the beginningbut barbie movie is one of the few i turned off after nearly one hour into itthis movie is just nonsense a waste of time better spent with cleaning the house or doing other loved or unloved thingsi dont understand why this movie is hyped so much it is nothing more than a gi joe for girls which is sadly at least not as less entertaining as gi joei guess even for barbie fans this might be hard to watch,-0.7343,negative
226,samann888,10-Aug-23,wasnt sure how good this film was going to be but the trailer suggested something magical and the film fulfilled my vision congrats to the director whos also the writer with her husband i believe to the great production design to the actors especially margot robbie and ryan gosling who continues to amuse and surprise with his ability to switch characters and add humor and a little bit of fun to his roles and he gets to sing again recommend for all ages really but certainly any kid thats over eight or nine should be able to understand half of whats going on and the parents or friends can explain the rest enjoy,0.9933,positive
227,fernandoschiavi,22-Jul-23,despite the strong commercial tone it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by greta gerwig and the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director  in addition to margot robbie herself as a producer barbie has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today and the film does it with a big heart the story is genuinely fun with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists reserving touching moments and provoking reflections especially in its final stretch debauchery is the great ally of gerwig and baumbach to deal not only with sexism but also with the corporate issue it wont be strange if you catch yourself thinking how did mattel let this film see the light of day laughing at yourself after all seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itselfin the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the barbie universe the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project in these changes of atmosphere we were able to appreciate the creative photography by rodrigo prieto  who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit  and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices such as costume pieces type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001 a space odyssey here well catch glimpses of the wizard of oz and the truman show well go through the fairytalelike artificiality of jacques demys films for the dance and choreographic performance of gene kelly for the visual and dramatic intensity of the little red shoes and all that jazz its a lot barbie is a well of enriching cinematographic referencesbut leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look in addition to addressing important points of todays society greta gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms barbie into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism the production is very much in line with a famous quentin tarantino interview in 2021 given to bill maher on his hbo broadcast real time in which he said ultimately ideology trumps art individual effort good entertainment unfortunately in this film this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war used as a puppet by political militancy full of language allegories open messages and ideological discourses the film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone to be a comedy and romance epic and it had the quality to do so but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrolthe film has an interesting premise thats undeniable and it flows most of the time but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn since the target audience here is females of all ages this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy criticism of beauty standards the hypocritical discourse against consumerism as if warner mattel artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales from selling new dolls etc manhatred all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots greedy dumb or wanting power for themselves greta gerwigs goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard because the stereotyped barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy  the character sasha played by ariana greenblatt is the one who plays this role like the militant of today always connected and who knows everything about life where gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentionsthe truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate not love barbie here hates men capitalism fun and hates barbie doll herself calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll if youre a woman and you played with her as a kid according to the movie you supported patriarchy barbie cant just be a pretty blonde thin woman either after all that doesnt encompass the mandatory diversity and inclusion in hollywood today to resolve this issue they created a universe in which everyone is barbie we even have a barbie who was born a man yes a trans barbie  who by the way is a doctor the men in barbieland who cares are there to be mistreated and ignored ken is just an accessory when barbie and ken come into the real world everything changes ken discovers patriarchy a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot and likes that world barbie finds unbridled machismo if barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense romance between barbie and ken not at all after all that wouldnt be empowering at all ken even rejects the doll at one pointken represents the evil patriarchy everything in this film becomes one big lecture one big sermon barbie scolding workers who whistle at her police officers harassing barbie at the police station a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue that is victim of the toxic men of the world barbie still has to choose between flipflops and heels showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made follow feminism that is flipflops we also have the passage of the protagonist gloria cheating on her husband a fool by the way and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheatingall male clichs are portrayed here according to the feminist view because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time according to the films script here the barbies were coopted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the kens in a kind of macho dystopia everything ken likes is depicted as toxic evil and terrible stallone godfather horses zack snyder etc barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women women have everything men have nothing mattel executives are all portrayed as white straight men and still calls this type of profile conservative fascist for the director it is never enough to be a woman you have to be a mother a wife work and still receive criticism the unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies and that they cannot study work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work yes because apparently the evil businessmen hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job at the end of the plot glorias feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy kens are beaten because they are dumb the barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective ken jealous with another ken of course after all all men only know how to create wars destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid after all if men are stupid why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film a basic and inexplicable plot hole herebarbie is a great satire but when it touches on feminist issues it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men since women are portrayed as being totally perfect sasha and gloria are the main latin characters here and the barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas obviously the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and of course the popularity of the barbie doll that has been successful for generations in addition to having many merits especially in the technical part the detailed creative and extremely tasteful scenarios especially in barbieland are a spectacle in themselves in addition to the magnificent performances by margot robbie charismatic and incredibly beautiful and ryan gosling hilarious as ever the musicals on the other hand are horrible poorly performed and owing a lot in that regardbarbie talks about choices and changes in the hands of greta gerwig the typical behavior of dolls and dolls via imagination takes on a critical form and points to many paths visiting metalanguage politicalsocial relations patriarchy and feminism feelings including the arrogant and insensitive posture of barbie in front of ken as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend existential crises or acceptance of ones social and gender condition the work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a liveaction barbie that is undeniable the problem is that in the end barbie doesnt even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of selfdiscovery who is barbie the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity,0.9953,positive

229,khadafimusaad,12-Aug-23,i like frating movies to know and understand women especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario and of course there is no doubt what makes it grate gerwig although this time there is no saoire ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films this work barbie comes set in barbielands fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman the moving plot of the barbie fantasy world conflict increases when entering the world of reality and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story which is a red herring type of plot what is meant is that the author diverts the audiences minds as in this film barbie has to correct flat soles but it is not the essence of the basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase with an amazing fantasy idea between the difference between the world of reality and the world called barbielandi went straight to the point which was the first time that barbie like women in general felt insecure she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach this is my favorite scene because it reminds me of my childhood when i saw my sister crying because her barbie doll didnt stand up straight i got the meaning from that scene that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places in this film barbie is a womans childhood imagination playing with barbie dolls thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll this adds up to barbies wish to go to the real world to repair the soles of her feet and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character barbie played by margot robbie this is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment in order to eliminate physical deficiencies regardless of the morals contained in her even though she is margot robbie toothe scene between the world of reality and the world of barbie in this case my analogy the world of reality is represented against liberalism and the world of barbie is imagined conservatively this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of barbie by feminism while the opposite of reality there is control of the world of barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner then the scene of an elderly grandmother namely ruth whom barbie first met accidentally sat next to ruth my intuition at this moment seeing the happiness of an old woman whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences thinking that beauty can disappear and thats what barbie feels when she looks back at ruth and also makes barbie aware of her question about death in the musical scene at the beginning of the film  this is where barbies maturity signifies when she returns to barbielandso that at the ending point the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman and the slogan shes everything hes just ken i interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable experience social phenomena that occur want to try new things until they get their point of freedom the purpose of life is understanding everything pride in being a complete woman who is in expressing herself in a complex environment  especially women who live in a patriarchal environment finally barbie realized the meaning of girl mother grandmother and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men in this case kenoverall the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value plus sarcasm scripts that contain in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor regarding production design without a doubt maybe i championed this award was obtained by barbie at the 2024 oscars because from that side it really broke marketing the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches i give barbie 75100,0.9966,positive

232,KevinHartsRedheadedStepSon,22-Jul-23,this is a weirdly complicated film i wish i could say that was meant to be a compliment but i found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveledthe basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny but then you introduce real world characters into the movie after the first act as shown in the trailer and it seems to lose its way add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the females expected role and youre left withmushagain it has some decent satire one moment but then also attempts to show heart the next one example is how ken discovers masculinity but the way a 10 year old boy might trucks and horses yet barbie sometimes spouts off a simpletons take on camus or neitzche honestly at some points theres a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth but ken is kind of a moronanyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapyi wanted to like this more than i could,0.9789,positive

235,darksun3,3-Sep-23,i saw this film with an open mind i was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way either visually through the actors perhaps a fun story or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with unfortunately it struck out on all accounts the much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast the actors were so clichd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch as you may have heard ryan gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name the movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes in fact it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writerdirectors personal concerns we were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the endmost concerning is that barbie was clearly modeled after the first matrix movie but in all the worst ways barbies world is a binary place composed of barbieland where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call the real world the real world is name of the place they travel to in matrix as well but in barbie its not a dark hellish landscape run by machines instead it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company mattel also the men are all shown to be domineering rude and chauvinistic its clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that its as unrealistic as the one in the matrix a man walking by barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside she then gets arrested for defending herself what while shes being arrested the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more the toy company executives all wear suits like the agents in the matrix and work in unrealistic barren industrial looking cubicles they also drive black suvs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world we get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in the real world and i lost count of the number of times the word patriarchy was used i know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world in the matrix there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in barbie there was mostly sadness in both the movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible the bright colorful happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark depressing and irredeemable if it was meant to reflect our real world well its so far out there that it doesnt even come close if its mean to show a fantasy world the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available it was difficult to complete watching barbie because it tried to say so much that in the end it said nothing at all it was a fantasy film with only an unhappy sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded,-0.9948,negative

240,FilmSchoolFlunk,13-Aug-23,the much anticipated barbie movie its unreal to see a packed theatre 3 weeks after release what a summer for moviesthis film was so much fun i had a perpetual grin on my face the entire two hours only growing wider with every joke im glad i experienced it in a theatre setting laughing along with others is a great feeling  and there was plenty of laughs to go around genuinely one of the funniest films ive seen in a while the adulttargeted culturalsocietal humour really really worked theres not much to say about the set design costume dept hair makeup and sets other than its nothing short of aweinspiring the production design is pretty much flawless also the movie references and homage payed to classics like 2001 and the matrix was very very much appreciated my only complaint would be the third act of the film i feel like the fast satirical humour of the first two acts worked perfectly challenging and poking fun at cultural societal and political norms but doing so in a clever way which serves the story and script  gracefully the third act throws this creative ingenuity out the window by way of heavy handed inyourface monologues,0.9917,positive
241,salexandria_f,9-Aug-23,i went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism but i found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie i interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that todays feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven leader boss bitch to have a meaningful life this movie voices that sometimes women while respecting the women that do dont want to be a leader whos a mom and has the career sometimes we just want to be average and thats ok i also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and gg did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie while i agree that it was annoying how the kens were treated at the beginning of the movie i felt the ending tied it all together overall i enjoyed the movie as humans i think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was i made for and even though this was referring to barbie it can be very relatable,0.9804,positive

267,felix-64582,21-Jul-23,first impressions of the movie where mixed the script is pretty much garbage it sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossiteit tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than womenthe movie is about laughing at how basic stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is if you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what im talking abouti must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points it was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen i went to see the movie making a double session after seeing oppenheimer so that may be why i notice the difference about the audienceif you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problemsbasically if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad if you are a girl taking over a guy then its all good the movie supports the extreme left politically btwat the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they dont need each other and can live by their own its a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl it tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when barbie gets cellulitis its then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes also lets include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason lets not include fat ken or paralytic ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit clearly not bodyshaming guysif you are wondering why i havent spoken about any of the plot well thats because there isnt one besides vibes and ideologiesi was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi comunity if there is a movie for it its this one but im glad they did not force any of thatits sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it i came out of the movie worried about where society is going and i think that was not supposed to happen,0.9945,positive

276,torichall,24-Jul-23,i must admit growing up ive had complicated feelings toward barbie in the beginning she was fun my favorite was one of the mermaid barbies but growing up i distanced myself from the pink toy it was no surprise i wasnt excited about the movie until i heard greta was involvedthis movie is exactly what i would want from a barbie movie its extremely campy throughout but also recognizes that life is very much complicated its not easy being an adult woman or man do you want to laugh watch this movie do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries then go and watch this movie,0.4149,positive
277,Miphed,13-Aug-23,i heard so much about the movie thanks to all the marketing and the controversy not sure what it was and finally watched it it seemed fun at first loved the whole production the set designs and costumes but the movie dragged in parts and it just got worst towards the end i wish they had a solid and fun ending but they tried to go a different way which didnt sit well with me dont want to really comment about the feminism empowerment i am all for it but it was too in your face and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie ruined the entertainment for me being a women there are of course many issues faced in reality but this one didnt really nail itamong the performances ryan gosling was really good as ken margot is very likeable in the movie and looks gorgeous will ferrell was fun to watch and im glad he was in the movieoverall a confusing plot i wouldnt watch it again the movie was a little less than 2 hrs why did i felt it longer,0.9859,positive

279,marisofigia,16-Aug-23,this movie is like an interesting conversation you strike up with a stranger touching on all sorts of things but never really going deep into anything i guess you can see it a trigger to discuss gender roles and existentialism with your friends after watching it unlike the barbies though most people tend to not form a life outlook after one powertalkthe cast and the art direction are immaculate with ryan gosling shining bright as a scenestealerthe plot doesnt flow though the main issue is that the movie lacks balance between contrived and raw storytelling so the whole endeavour seems clanky at times,0.8847,positive

283,Guadalupapi,7-Aug-23,male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships as it tends undervalue any other form of love it results in a current and big social problem straight men who have zero valuable deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love thats why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend a husband a providerken and barbie had to enter the real world to realize this among more important and focal problems related to feminity and the place of women in society which were precise but i dont write about because as a cisgender man i think is more valuable if i talk about masculinity and male problems they question their identity and ken realizes he doesnt know himself or his place if he doesnt have barbie by his sidethis is not something that i see discussed much in commercial cinema so im glad it was and thats why i focus only in that subject in this review because it was my favorite message related to the male characters with the rest of the movie there are many things that couldve been done better such as the self critiqueparody and the metairony but the good elements surpassed the negatives ones in my opinion its a fun movie its very simple but you know sometimes less is more and i think its better that way in barbieits not the movie of the year and its definitely not gerwigs best or deeper film but its worth noticing the biggest commercial flick of the year to be a sortof gender issues 101 to people who might havent even question their gendered role in todays society beyond men work women shelter and thats screwed up its as feminist as a hollywood commercial film can bemy favorite barbie is hari nefs doctor barbie,0.9888,positive
284,cj-farnstrom,19-Jul-23,making a barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea having barbie comment on the patriarchy just like animal farm about communism and wall street about capitalism its admirable and the message gets throughthe problem is that the actual movie is so bad even though you buy in on the two worlds etc etc in the end it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel normally the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels here everything is spelled out from a a teachers desk and the whole film comes across as bit thini would not watch this movie again,0.7723,positive
285,rlabraaten,25-Jul-23,it was nostalgic hilarious esthetically orgasmic and very moving it covered all generations of barbie which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid it also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming wonderful way i felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well awesome soundtrack amazing sets and wardrobes the cast was amazing the writing was perfect such an original unique stroy line if youre going to criticize this movie for going against your political beliefs then you dont deserve this movie anyways women are allowed to talk about the female experience and barbie was a great way to do it i just saw it 2 days ago and i really want to see it again,0.9887,positive

be age i knew that it couldnt be a bad movie since it has a very good director luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story it is a criticism using humor about feminism machismo patriarchy about what women face i had never thought that barbie was nominated by women however her mistake was wanting perfectionism about existential doubts the world dominated by men on many occasions the relationships of mothers and adolescents the daily routine trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate i think it is a film that being well analyzed has very good components and a very good plot something that one never imagined from a movie about barbie",0.989,positive

308,annelauremilleville,4-Aug-23,as of todays date i would say this is the film produced by luckychap entertainment that ive liked the least despite a more than promising trailer despite a perfect cast margot robbie  ryan gosling seem to be born to play these roles and the adorable america ferrera  emma mackey are always a delight to have on screen  sets  atmosphere that exceeded my expectations i wasnt convinced by the storytelling at the end the first half of the film is great but things get complicated when barbie  ken leave barbieland and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes when i think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that domination never serves anyone in short the film is worth seeing but i have to admit that given my expectations of it im a little disappointed even if the costumessettingsacting are stunning,0.1029,positive
309,meepsonic,25-Aug-23,youll never going to hate this movie as soon as possibleso i finally watch the new barbie movie in theatres but as soon as i watch the movie im very shy to see her in reallife at this point me and my niece and my cousin went to the mall to watch this movie mario movie is for kids but barbie was not either made for kids though but its a liveaction movie i rate this movie a perfect star 1010in under a span of a month its official the barbie movie will surpass mario bros which is still standing on top of the box office so now im tired of people saying positive things about the super mario bros movie and this is why the negative reviewers are getting crapped on because our reviews are our opinion that they dont like,0.6807,positive
310,arungeorge13,13-Sep-23,my onlyever memory of a barbie doll was the one my cousin sister once owned and i secretly sabotaged owing to some temporary argument in our childhood i do remember that it was a stereotypical version with blonde hair and a pink or some shade of it dress i made that oncegoodlooking doll into crazy barbie by drawing weird shapes on her face pulling some of her hair out and twisting at least one of her plastic limbs i also remember hiding away some of the crockery tea cups and the like shortly after well this film brought back that repressed memory which i dont think i apologized to her for of course i did so afterwards and thats how rewarding the movie felt for methe first act of barbie was deliberately plastic as if gerwig was trying to reinforce the idea of how a perfectly feminine world exists the hi barbies were starting to get a bit annoying and the unabashed celebration of every night being girls night and women basically holding all decisionmaking power came across as gerwing trying to impose the blunt idea that if women are involved in everything the world automatically becomes a better place  no questions asked when you perceive this through a mans lens its actually pretty brilliant this is exactly what women must feel at least frequently when they see us celebrating masculinity even to toxic levels robbie is the perfect choice to portray stereotypical barbie and thats purely because she can make us feel for the characters existential crisis just as much as we can adore her looksthe films binding strength however is ryan goslings ken as the film progressed it almost felt like if this were a movie about barbie questioning her existence and just fighting mattels idea of corporate villainy that wouldve been clichd kens presence adds an intriguing layer  when he and barbie make it to the real world and concludes that men rule the real world he becomes the antithesis he gathers all kens in barbieland and makes them acknowledge patriarchy at this point as much as i was entertained by kens antics barbies realizations and the wonderful production design costumes and soundtrack i wasnt sure how gerwig would tackle the final act the first two acts came across as both sides being somewhat toxic what with the sidelining of the opposite gender for no apparent reasonbut the final act is a masterstroke other than gerwigs decision not to fully antagonize the corporate that manufactures barbie dolls and their excessive product placements because well they coproduced it the writing is brilliant the fact that they allowed gerwig to go this far itself is refreshing it acknowledges errors on both ends and understands how a balance is entirely significant it asks ken to stand on his own two feet without having barbie by his side always it also pays tribute to barbies creator for all her faults including tax evasion adding a couple of conversational scenes featuring her and margots barbie that gives the latter some level of character closure this is how you make a film based on a toy and give it the depth it wholly deserves shine on greta ,0.9595,positive
311,anniegaybis,24-Jul-23,first off let me say  i couldnt wait to see this got tickets for myself and friends we all wore pink the leads were terrific the marketing campaign was completely misleading the first 40 minutes at tops was what we all came to see  then it became very heavy handed it became confusing mattel who was one of the producers of it should feel shame for i think they ruined their good name with how they let themselves be represented it was pg and right at the beginning when they have the little girls smashing i mean smashing their dolls to bits cause now their is barbiea couple of little kids in the audience got very upset to see the dolls smashed this is not a kids movie it wasent my kind of movie either one of my friends said it was about an hour too long their were these meanings and symbolism tht didnt need to be in this and whatever the writers were trying to get at it didnt work at least for meneedlessly having ken sing and thats the least of itreferring to the line some of my best friends are jewishcompletly wrongeven though i now know the history of the doll just wasent necessary i cannot recommend i feel i wasted my friends time and some of mineit really hurts your soul when you so look forward to seeing something and it turns out to be blech,0.6382,positive
312,gregorydickens-99515,22-Jul-23,this film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set costume and prop designs however the film shoves its agendas down our throats like its thanksgiving dinnerthe marketing team played it off as just a fun harmless selfaware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism mockery of the entire male species outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experiencethe movie contrasts barbieland as femaledominatedcontrolling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something likewise in the real world men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff the film shows half the human population the men as utterly and irredeemably horribleand by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team nope the kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the barbies go back to their girlpower or ruling everything without thinking twice about it it feels like they almost had a good ending but simply just couldnt help themselvesin front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking is it almost over multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene do not take your little girls to this one truly a wolf in sheeps clothing using a kids toy as a trojan horse for feminist messaging is just ridiculous,0.99,positive
313,liamjd-36600,3-Sep-23,i heard it was preachy before going to watch it but still expected it to be a fun easy watch i feel like this is being rated higher because people think theres an important message in there but this shouldnt distract anyone from the fact that its a very very bad film with a terrible storyline after a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable the storyline is what youd expect from a poorly written childrens film but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly only highlights were margot robbies performance and michael cera and kate mckinnons small but funny parts,0.2674,positive
314,felicianoelle,24-Jul-23,i will keep this as spoiler free as possible when i heard greta gerwig was directing the barbie movie i was instantly excited to the fear of everyone around me i would tell them greta gerwig wouldnt do a superficial barbie movie it would be more it would have message to my surprise it was all of that and more it was funny and clever it showed the problems with barbie the toy but also the dreams for barbie for young girls it was campy in the best way and america ferreras monologue deserved a standing ovation and i even teared up a few times so please ignore the low dumb reviews and go see the movie and make up your own opinions at least for me it was delight to be seen and i hope you feel the same,0.9607,positive
315,Steve9920,25-Oct-23,the cinematography is eye watering literally you may need sun glasses pinks and blues have never looked pinkier or bluier yellows are more yellowy than a yellow thing to such an extent that when it goes on to the real world scenes it makes you kind of disappointed as to how bland everyday reality can be inevitably there is a lot of green screen effects which is still not perfect despite modern day digital wizadry but thats nit picking this is a feast for the eyes  margot robbie includeddamn just objectified did i learn nothing from this movieas expected the soundtrack throbbed along with some good upbeat and downbeat tracks though it all sounded kind of safe with nothing to really get the heart pumping imoplot and script were engaging enough though there could have been a bit more jeapordy or maybe a real villain to booo and hisss at  a big orange idiot of a character maybe yes it turns a tad preachy at times and those of a certain political viewpoint may roll their eyes or huff and puff a bit but there are learning lessons and points of recognition for most i imaginei am not the target audience but enjoyed it nontheless,0.9399,positive
316,bryvill,1-Aug-23,as we all know the title of the movie suggest fun tons of cheesy moments drama and a lot of imaginations i entered the theater expecting the same and placed all my expectations low and just go how the film flows surprisingly it has a lot of funny moments in the film at times silly but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining margot robbie as barbie was surely a perfect role of her while ryan gosling as ken did the same and he was more funnier as expected visual effects were cool to watch and soundtrack was for me a phenomenal people do see mixed reviewed after seeing it but do see barbie as a film and enjoy its ride,0.9854,positive
317,nathaliacardozo,21-Jul-23,the movie was very good it had comic moments impeccable costumes and exceptional acting as well as necessary political dialogues however despite these strengths the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted leaving a sense of dissatisfaction it felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the wellcrafted narrative while the movie has its merits the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again however it is worth recognizing the films strengths and the thoughtprovoking discussions it initiated,-0.2209,negative
318,allipthomas,21-Jul-23,this movie is everything and more its comedic colorful entertaining heartfelt nostalgic and has such a truly meaningful message thats fit for everyonewhile the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy its a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone not just women where ryan goslings ken was struggling to find who he really is because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity theres also the more obvious example of the barbies being brainwashed into servitudeas marvelously played by margot robbie barbie feels the struggles that many women face  where we feel lost at some point in our lives america ferreras monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary this movie positively shows the beauty of womanhoodbarbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come,0.9783,positive

everything is so horrible and wrong for women today and most men hate women now as a woman watching this movie i felt as if i was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked and how much men have stolen from me which is not at all the case ive had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything ive ever accomplishedi had a few laughs but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction it seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything wow sounds like sexism to me id prefer equality which is something that we currently have",0.8774,positive
320,gianmarcocibella,21-Jul-23,its hard to say this movie isnt great even if you dont agree with the third act feminism part i mean margot robbie nailed it and ryan gosling come on i was expecting so much from him and he was even better than i tought so freaking funny and always on point the set production and costume design are of course oscar nominees alreadyoverall i liked the message the social critic the perfomances the production the jokes were very funny the references whats there not to like such an enjoyable movie perhaps the part played by america ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way but that doesnt ruin the movie at all i think its a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well,0.9642,positive
321,ariannakerber,21-Jul-23,this was a great movie for the type that it is yes is cheeky  cheesy over the top its also heart warming fun and really original i loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female young or old it truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel they also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children the casting of mr as barbie and rg as ken were such perfect choices the kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings perfect balance of nostalgia and today highly recommend it,0.9937,positive
322,sophannista,28-Jul-23,i have questions when the kens take over barbie land they see the barbies as just accessories but then when the barbies just swap places every ken still had a barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening i just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd i guess i still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing will ferrells character was just cheap laughs nothing new for him hes too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails also the parallels between this and dont worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion an unclear driving force of why this is happening now  randomly thinking about death i would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out glorias yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls,0.9089,positive
323,liorkorobeynikov,3-Nov-23,as i stated in the title of this review first and foremost this movie is absolutely worth your time especially with a rather short runtime that is an hour and fifty minutesthis movie has a ton of soul behind it and it shows many of the scenes are just fantastically made and you could feel they arent just corporate copypaste pieces made to create a filmhowever i do feel like barbie suffers from the same issues that movies like jojo rabbit do while having the movie have a nonserious feel to it at times and switching it around certain scenes it really diminishes the value of both sidesdespite this this movie is still kenough like all of us,0.8874,positive
324,sofiaboneva,30-Jul-23,the movie is great everyone says its very preachy but i actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner it makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to  for example why most cash has famous men on them and not one woman with some exceptions around the world of course it also presents ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry  clingy confused a bit inadequate annoying etcits smart its very funny its interesting and it deserves the hype,0.0348,neutral

are the advanced primate and humans their chattelsi hated the movie as a boy in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film could it happen i wondered where humans could become inferior to another species if it did would we deserve it the film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure i have never dared rewatch itthe 2023 movie barbie looks nothing like planet of the apes its cinematography is an exercise in highoctane kitsch as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell yet it too explores role reversal here between sexes rather than speciesbarbieland is a quasimirror image of realworld the films moniker for presentday california barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy the barbies for they are multiple live happy fulfilled lives they prosper at the top of every profession and public office they never age bodily imperfections are impossible and life is a perpetual merrygoround of choreographed parties infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood the men  the kens  are decoration they are unable to perform even basic functions physical and sexual they lack genitals their muscles are impressive but purely for show they preen on the beach but surfing is beyond themone day classic barbie margot robbie awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her highheeled shoes she no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes but on flat ordinary soles to the collective horror of her sisterhoodrobbie realises something is wrong and  following a revelation from her compatriot weird barbie  sets out to realworld to resolve it classic ken ryan gosling stows away in her car the duo eventually arrive in santa monica via a series of rosetinted vehiclesit isnt long before gosling discovers that realworld is unlike barbieworld here the power is held by men gosling surprised to be treated with respect becomes fascinated with patriarchy and quickly warms to the paradigm for robbie the experience is the opposite people mock her daily life is threatening not fun her selfconfidence warps into selfconsciousness ken precedes her return to barbieland and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into kendom a toyish grotesque of realworld where the kens are in charge and the barbies retained as ornamental servantsmuch ensues we race and chase suvs with the motheranddaughter pair who own robbies doll in realworld theres an overlong musical sequence in which gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in la la land mattels allmale csuite led by the onedimensional will ferrell provide limited laughs and add little to the plot beyond an admirable modicum of selfawareness products are placed  even chanel  with abandon still we are being entertained and mostly engagedthe final act sees barbie and friends manipulate the kens and prevail there are no suffragers in barbieland and following a unanimous referendum of an allfemale electorate the natural order of things is restored a dark compelling twist looks imminent but it never arrivesrather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative director greta gerwig retreats from it instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into welltrodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism i die therefore i amrobbies barbie eventually opts not to live in barbieworld but as a real imperfect woman in los angeles this is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary barbieworld might itself become but because she likes the idea of being human how do the remaining barbies perceive their homeland do they support gynocracy are they comfortable with the kens being sidelined the passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that for the first 85 minutes hammers home its message relentlessly and preciselythe narrator helen mirren assures us that one day the kens might enjoy the same status in barbieworld that women do in realworld it is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised given the kens are gainlessly employed politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary barbie and ken experience equality in neither barbieworld nor realworld in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other perhaps barbie ultimately prefers la because despite its manifold flaws it at least has no pretence to being a utopiain planet of the apes we discover in the final reel that hestons destination is not a dystopian otherworld but earth itself through nuclear war mans hatred greed and hubris has caused his own downfall the oppressor has become the oppressed perhaps man deserves it in barbie gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion instead she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of hollywood and mattel,0.0108,neutral
326,bbreee,17-Aug-23,was just okay the acting is super ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think and margot is a perfect barbie she ate her role up this is not a kids movie has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting most of the humour lands for me honestly i thought it was cute the diolouge isnt best but its a movie about barbie what were any of us really expectingit was kinda confusing towards the end the begininng was really fun maybe a little bit annoying but thats just me like i said not my type of film the colors were great the barbieland set was cute after they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me i thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up and everythings fine they tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way it seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene i feel the feminist point of the film wouldve come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then boom big monolouge it was just a lot but empty at the same timeand i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think like point proven all women have had that happen to them it was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfyand nothing was ever really resolved in the real world besides the mom and daughter with barbie and then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel first female ceo feminism but no shes just going to the gynocologist yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didnt take itoverall much different than expected this dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for thought it was going to be lightheartedso idk it was cute i may be too hard on it cause i enjoy movies that make you think and have deeper elements all the elements here were blatently there also im saying all this as a young adult female i know i was one of the target audiences for this,0.9945,positive

328,vazran,14-Aug-23,so i just wanna say that i was very hyped for this movie but after i watched this i was a bit disappointedthe movie has a lot of cringe scenes one of them are funny too but at some point this is just cringe and too muchabout the message of this movie i agree with it and i like it because in our world women are really disrespected harassed and so on but at some point it was too much i say this as a male but one of my friends who is a girl has the same opinion but the other one with the mom and the teenager rebonding that was amazingthe sound tracks are really good tho to include artists like nicki minaj ice spice dua lipa billie eilish and so on is a great move to make this film an iconic onethe cast is great and i think margot robbie played barbie perfectly with her acting and her appearance tooin conclusion i recommend this movie because i think this is a film that anyone has to watch because its a barbie one and it can also teach teenagers a lesson despite the cringe scenes,0.9898,positive
329,izzy-80478,21-Jul-23,this movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society to barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world the movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual to me the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and i felt it had such a deep message to be proud that i am a woman it also referenced how just because toy ken is an accessory to barbie that doesnt have to be his only personality trait which i believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about womens explorations and feelings but mens as well,0.9617,positive
330,felipedesouzarosa,24-Jul-23,barbie is a curious film and i believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average the film tries to criticize several things at the same time  criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on selfknowledge besides that i assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often its not clear what the movie really wants to be about maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better anyway the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason i hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on,0.6899,positive
331,ericvankeimpema,2-Oct-23,we saw the movie because everyone was talking about it specially the rebirth of barbie and the political message feminism were supposedly great well after 10 minutes we already wanted to walk away fromt he movie its totally overhyped bad script sort of these typical teenage american football humor movies which is very cheap and dull to watch there was litterally nothing entertaining or nice about the movie the scenes in the matell headquarters were overly childish maybe one truth was well demonstrated in the movie everything was pink the houses in barbieland did not have walls and the drinking cups and shower had no fluids in them oh yes and barbies car had no engine,-0.398,negative

339,adibshahriar,23-Jul-23,at the interval i was surprised of how much i was enjoying barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism the overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age but it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up ryan gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times margot robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film but i expected more from barbie and greta gerwig didnt satisfy me she should have tried for a different sort of ending,0.9615,positive

341,Boskjoss,22-Jul-23,"i went in there with o expectations but boy it was cunning and audacious to say the least it is one the most original movie made in terms of writing filming cinematography in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plotbarbie speaks to alot of women and
men about feminism patriarchy consumerism and existentialism in its own weird sometimes cringe but mostly funny wayfull marks for casting top to toe perfect casting for barbie and ken but movi is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwisetotally skippable in the theatres its not worth the hype tbh",0.7711,positive
342,theamykeown,30-Aug-23,it was not as lighthearted and fun as i was hoping i wasnt expecting such a deep message to be told to me by a barbie there is a lot of satire in the film that i feel some will take to be truthsbut costumes and sets were on point i hope that team gets all the nods for their accomplishments the soundtrack is lacking too maybe i do not have many nice things about this film other than it wasnt for me instead of it being a cute comedy i became more depressed by watching the movie margot and gosling played their roles well and i applaud them but the other all content was just too deep and not fun,0.425,positive
343,zwbnmzrqk,21-Jul-23,i never cared for barbie but the movie is really good i think the casting is perfect and the music and who they got to do the soundtrack i also love how they made the barbie world a separate land and it was brighter then the whole world and i love how they went to the mattel head quarters and the people trying to take her away and barbie and ken being in the real in the real world also the marketing team did amazing on the promo and advertisement on the movie with all the companys collab with barbie and etc so overall the barbie movie got a lot of hype and well deserved excellent film and amazing for people who love barbie,0.9947,positive
344,avemerillo,23-Jul-23,started well had some great moments and acting was goodhowever the point of turning kenland back to barbielandwhat was supposed to convey that barbies aka women actually want to live looking like barbies in their almost identical barbiehouses that its women against men and men their dreams are stupidi found the mattel team going to barbieland totally out of context and it didnt add anything either to idea or humor of the movie men leading the patriarchy in real world were made to look silly and idiotic which didnt add anything to the ideas but felt embarrassing rather than funnyi found the movie weird confusing and not empowering at all,-0.3919,negative
345,dvlbr,23-Jul-23,what a cinematic experience the mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination i dont know where to start i feel like greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in hollywood this film is iconic using the character and icon of barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do throughout the film i was always connecting it to disneys soul due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message barbie experiencing the real life for the first time life is unique a beautiful gift that its worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering  using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics patriarchy feminism life as a woman in all its aspects all in a really enjoyable beautifully crafted comedic way barbie and the married writers manages to unite different kinds of genres musical  ryan gosling is sublime in musicals you know what i mean  bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer in a special way this movie is near to perfection the epilogue really adds to that perfection with a heartwrenching soundtrack by billie eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by margot robbie its her year and she deserves all of it to summarise the film i am kenough,0.997,positive
346,qrawbr,26-Jul-23,im only saying it could have been better because of the hype i was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film firstly ill say that margot as barbie and ryan as ken were great individually a large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen i found watching ken discovering patriarchy to be the most hilarious part of the film however one of the first critiques i have is that it felt like the movie didnt spend enough time in barbieland the serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the perfect life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and kens this also would have made me personally feel more like i care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that barbie and ken were experiencing when they went to the real world secondly its use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about i think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate i understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone and it was however it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used it just felt in my personal opinion to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message finally which brings me to my third critique is that the movie didnt seem to be for kids but at the same time it was my first argument for why perhaps the two critiques i have made might not be valid is because its a kids film and in that sense it would well make sense but then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldnt be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children dont get me wrong i love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at which i argue shrek did very well for example however the script of this movie im not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points i madenevertheless it was an enjoyable film and good in its own merits ken as a character made a lot of sense given his whole purpose as a doll in real life and that essence i think they captured well 710,0.9816,positive
347,inacarunderwater08,25-Jul-23,such a silly beautiful wonderful movie this is truly a cinematic masterpiece it has heart soul and lots of laughs ive seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch im looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well this will definitely be one i watch a lot ryan goslings ken is everything and hes absolutely perfect this entire movie is perfect i dont want to say too much and spoil anything for those that havent seen it yet so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it what are you waiting for p s isnt not sexist its making a point and people that have a problem with what its saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards,0.9907,positive

349,abskate,23-Sep-23,walk into this film not completely knowing what to expect but came out pleasantly surprised good set designs a lot of good shots throughout the film pretty solid humor throughout the film so overall good experience but now in terms of casting margot robbie was a great choice for barbie but man does ryan gosling really steal the show almost makes me wish he was in more comedies will ferrell also makes an appearance and theres a pretty good job and in terms of the overall message definitely wasnt as preachy as most people put it out to be so i dont think the overall message was as bad as some people had it out but overall a fan film would recommend,0.9938,positive
350,amandakelly-44326,21-Jul-23,the only good things about this movie were the actors felt like i was watching one big commercial for barbie constantly plugging outfits and what barbie really means for young girls i guess it was produced by mattel which says a loti was hoping for something smart and satirical like the lego movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humourthe nostalgia is the draw card for people including me i loved barbie growing up but it wasnt enough for me to enjoy thisdont waste your time the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together,0.9294,positive
351,brendan-63701,8-Sep-23,barbie opens with an homage to 2001 a space odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning artificial reality of barbieland where the sky is a painting and the food imagined its colorful the set designers display fully realized artistic visionsits nice to see a movie that isnt over sanitized for a mass audience a movie that doesnt play it safe you can see the influences greta gerwig wanted to include from old hollywood all over the place margot robbie is the star as barbie fully embodying the perfect barbie life until cracks start to form in barbielandbarbie presents two dystopian worlds one a bad version of the real world and barbieland where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power it was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class ken is essential to the emotional core of the film hes how we see the injustice of barbieland the movie isnt manhating it uses the poor treatment of the kens by the barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are significant spoilers after this pointthe movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from gloria thanks to america ferreras excellent performance that we dont have to be perfect we can embrace being ordinary she doesnt want the perfect barbie life either she wants an ordinary barbie thats also a mom loves her family and embraces her imperfections as good things the concern with insecurity caused by barbie is made less tactfully by glorias daughter who goes on a screed calling barbie a fascist you cant tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at gen z self righteousnessrobbies stereotypical barbie also learns these values shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of barbieland this is why its so important she leaves barbieland at the end of the film she rejects the reimposed female domination of barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in barbieland barbieland is not the good placethere were some significant negatives for me though i thought the movie had some humor that fell very flat in parts the scenes at mattel didnt do much for me the movie was at its weakest in the real world where we spent a lot of time some of the characters had rushed developmenti am kenough,0.9752,positive
352,musajasna,20-Jul-23,well scenography is nice wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty the plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something its not  a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails i didnt have any expectations coming to the cinema i just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead i got a speech about patriarchy and mens world not to say it isnt but its not something you would expect from a barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy moviedevelopment of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation,0.9217,positive
353,barbett-1,8-Aug-23,barbie is a fun little movie that is at its core a satire on traditional gender roles in society thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom if ever lives up to our youthful expectations some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive antimale agenda but i cant see it that way its simply a movie based on a toy that dares to actually not take itself seriously look at other films in this genre such as battleship gi joe and the transformers films all take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark realism barbie doesnt do that it reveals that its a joke in the very first sceneis this a great movie absolutely not but it is fun entertaining summertime fluff margo robbie and ryan gosling both look and act perfectly plastic the set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace see it and enjoy,0.9893,positive

357,ghoshi-kol,23-Jul-23,the real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this friday one was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema the former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a mans world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics to address the elephant in the room oppenheimer beats barbie on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight irrespective of what the box office figures might denotethat said barbie is a good film a fun watch that could have been so much more the first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime it was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant colourful world without any trace of morbidity the barbie houses the beach the house of the weird barbie the roads the netherlandslike fields the sea  they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that gerwigs vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow to conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our barbies the barbies come from all walks of life hold important positions and stay at the frontline of barbie life  a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash at the center of all these barbies is margot robbies stereotypical barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety she is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned hence the stereotype about her the kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities all was well until the real world began messing with the barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner barbie should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in the last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done ken song  one of my favourite moments from the film gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision for the world she has accomplished in this film for the infinite ideas she has established  feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes she has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression if only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much betterbarbie packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy sadness existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed issa rae as president barbie and kate mckinnon as weird barbie are two other standouts but the real star of the show is ryan gosling  his kenergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout just look at his incredible comedic chops when ken visits the human world you just cant have kenough of goslings ken la la land showed that he could dance really well a skill he has put effectively to use in the ken song tooin the end gerwigs film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena it could have had a little more of the muchness as the mad hatter would say in alice in wonderland in the fun department it dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavyhandedness drags it down to an extent alas,0.9952,positive
358,Mateo-EGC,20-Jul-23,ryan gosling as ken i loved too much but margot robbie as barbie is perfecti understood the message very well its great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a pretty person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live and after all men and women and every living being deserve to be happyone of the scenes i loved aside from the opening reference is the just ken exclusive scene i would have loved to see more of ken and dont forget that you can be whatever you want to beby the way i absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand,0.97,positive

366,priangshupaul-03412,21-Jul-23,first id like to clarify one thing barbie is not an antimen or a menhating movie in any shape or form instead it is a very thoughtprovoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as identity selfdiscovery existentialism ethics feminism gender roles consumerism materialism beauty and body imagebarbie feels like a satirical take on the real world the world we live inthe opening scene of barbie was very similar to the opening scene of stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey then we get introduced to the barbieland the most perfect ideal world according to the barbies everyones happy everyones joyful and cheerful and most importantly everything is being run by the barbies everything ken is just a supporting character there wont be a ken with barbiebut then things start to change barbie talks about death mind you nobody dies in barbieland they get discontinued by mattel then barbie embarks on a journey of selfdiscovery accompanied by kenone of my favorite scenes is when barbie and ken are in the real world and both of them get catcalled the stark contrast between the reaction of both barbie and ken to the catcalling was portrayed very accuratelyken learns about patriarchy in the real world ken used to live in a world where everything is run by barbie but in the real its literally the opposite ken takes all he has learned in the real world back to barbieland and changes everything he literally changes barbieland to kendom landmeanwhile barbie is trying to find answers to why she doesnt feel perfect anymore or why she doesnt feel pretty anymorewe get a glimpse of the mattel corporation as well and how literally every working person is like a dollthere is this one monologue in the film which stands out the monologue which helped barbie get out of her existential crisisthe last 1520 minutes of the film are perfect the set designing the dialogues everything  it was perfectif you are someone who loves great films and enjoys great storytelling youll love barbiegive it a chance and youll not regret it,0.9949,positive
367,californiadreamer1432,21-Jul-23,this movie touches on complex themes the way the truman show and west world were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women barbieland vs men the real world it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide what i appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a barbie at their side to feel successful it occurred in barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds its easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals theres a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the ken experience curious what men thought of it and if they could relateset design and visual humor were awesome everyone played their role with a lot of heart my soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well it was just wonderfully entertaining,0.9958,positive
368,ninab-76974,27-Sep-23,i watched the barbie movie a few weeks after it came out so i was expecting to experience all the emotions people raved about on twitter overall i thought the movie was wellproduced but i think its marketing was misleading now i know that this movie couldnt be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of barbie not a barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original with that being said i think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to societys standards etc is nothing we havent heard before which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this another question i have is why did ken have a song it didnt benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition i wouldnt say i was disappointed in this movie but i think it was overhyped just a little bit,0.652,positive

372,patrickgillavila,6-Aug-23,i saw this movie in theatres and i found it kind of underwhelming each and every act of the film feels so different and disconnected from the other and by the end it feels like the plot looses traction but that doesnt mean i thought the movie was bad i thought it was funny and charming all throughout but i guess my issue is that im in the wrong demographic near the beginning and near the end theres a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman and as a man i cant relate as a result i had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments and on top of that halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring but overall id say its a solid 710,0.3612,positive

376,thaomytran-21068,19-Jul-23,barbie movie was alright some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all jokes here and there were sexually but that was it nowadays i believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color what is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the barbieworld to the real world and vice versa besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out i wouldnt definitely watch this movie again though i would watch it as a drinking game whenever someone says barbie you have to take a shot cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times,-0.692,negative
377,olgakastritsi-81359,22-Jul-23,firstly ill say that im the movies target audience a female in her 20s even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies which i 100 agree with and the right to choose what you want to be in your life it felt uncomfortable it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated in the world of barbie all kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes i wont give spoilers but in this perfect barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only barbie but the ken dolls are also doctors scientists politicians etc etcmargot robbie and ryan gosling went above and beyond i enjoyed their performances some scenes were also very funny but personally i did not like the ending,0.9386,positive
378,wirsingleon,31-Jul-23,"margot robbie is perfect as barbie
john cena and america ferrera deliver hilarious performances
the movie tackles feminism and patriarchy in a funny and unsubtle waybarbie movie is an inventive comedy that works both as a love letter and deconstruction of barbie as a concept
the movie is fun creative and goes in unexpected directions
it has clever messages about manhood and redemption
kens character is redeemed and barbie apologizes to him for ignoring him before
the movie portrays how isolating manhood can be and ends with the kens finding fulfillment in being their own people
the song im just ken is catchy and perfectly integrated into the final battlebarbie is a movie that explores the struggles and joy of womanhood
click to collapse
seek out female perspectives on this movie to understand its message about womanhood
the movie is extremely funny welldirected and has wonderful sets and costumes",0.9887,positive
379,ysszhb,22-Jul-23,every one  man and woman should watch this movie with an openmind and introspection about current society barbie was one of the most real complex insightful trippiest thoughtful and educational videos ive watched in a long time this movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning to get the full experience of the art of the movie you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layersi came in expecting a lighthearted fun and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical barbie brand but the movie brought so much more depth and substance be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions,0.8885,positive
380,michela-54051,24-Jul-23,the movie started on the light side and fun but the longer it went on the more preachy it became it seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie this gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing where you are laughing a little not a lot but then the movie goes into a long life lesson on how men are bad and not very smart but somehow they run the real world women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match barbie world this changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson which takes a lot of the fun out of it too bad,0.7676,positive
381,ActionMovieDude,20-Jul-23,greta gerwig has had a hit or miss career her film little women was fairly entertaining but i found her film lady bird to be completely obnoxious same goes for margot robbie i enjoyed her in wolf of wall street and once upon a time in hollywood but really disliked i tonya and birds of preynow comes barbie based on the long running series of dolls from mattel now as a guy i never played with barbies prefering to play video games over dolls however my sisters enjoyed playing them and thats the question about this film who is the target audience for this film because on one hand it looked like a film designed for sixty year old women who never got over playing with their dolls and on another hand its advertising is aimed at little girls even though some of the material maybe offensive to a lot of familiesthe plotline which is extremely thin involves barbie living the perfect life in barbieland where barbie dolls of all types live and where all the kens hang out at the beach then all of a sudden barbie escapes to the real world where she is treated like a dog really hammering home greta gerwigs misandryi can see this film having a decent opening weekend but expect it to drop like a rock in the following weeks when people realize this film is really just a one trick pony the pink sets look nice but the screenplay and the annoying script are definitely going to divide audiences and this film really doenst have mainstream appeal at all most of all will farrel as the ceo of mattel is about as annoying as ever and the misanderyt stereotypes are about entertaining as watching paint drya one on a scale of 110 save yourself the headache and see the much better oppenheimer instead,0.9876,positive
382,KFstudios2009,3-Sep-23,barbenheimer who is the winner actually when i thought about it their are two completely different movies both of them are great i will tell you why this movie is great but the main point is that you cant just compare this two movies anyway greta gerwig did an absolutely amazing job and i was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was this is not made for kids even if you could think this would be for kids but no some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand the good things about barbie is the valuable moral itself they show you that the world and humanity isnt perfect and it is never going to be perfect you just have to focus on how you are now they showed how women were treated in centuries and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women strong reckless and to never show their feelings that is something i wouldnt expect from this movie i was very surprised and the representation of men ken just ken as the main ken played be ryan gosling he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour margot robbie was the second big star or the first both of them were amazing but she played with such a feeling and emotion when barbie the main barbie played by margot discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect and that not everyone are like her she was completely off margot robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in besides the actors the storytelling scenography and music soundtrack was amazing sometimes it was a bit too much screaming but thats not the point this movie was awesome this is a movie for everyone if you like barbie this movie is for you if you dont like barbie this movie is for you this is a movie made for everyone everyone can enjoy it and i cant really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden this movie offers you so much moral entertainment and i think this was a great movie,0.9968,positive
383,ldrago-99471,30-Jul-23,i thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous taking the mickey out of the whole barbie phenomenon that it isgreat colour and cinematography and i even laughed in some parts then something strange happened about half way through it got all serious and made ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured which i agree to be true but didnt fit where i thought this movie was goingnot quite sure who this movie was intended for but i walked out disappointed the males all ended up being either bad or stupid or both not sure if this is a film that the great will ferrell can hold his head up high for as his role served very little purposethe acting and cinematography saved it,-0.2076,negative
384,alicianora,21-Jul-23,barbie was hilarious emotional and exciting i loved the wardrobe and props  very colorful and exact replicas of what i played with in the 90s i have to say i was pleasantly surprised with this movie  casting was perfect i especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre this is definitely a feel good movie and i hope they continue the franchise i have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner in good way there is a lot of action dancing and surprise ha ha moments this is perfect for families and adults really go see it,0.9934,positive
385,marianacastro-54554,23-Jul-23,i enjoyed the creation of the barbie world the costumes set design and i think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant the script however was not that solidthey were going for a direct transparent explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue but it often had a hard time landing particularly at the beginning some things felt spoonfed to the audience as if they werent going to understand the givens of ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in barbie land we visually understand it but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessarythe pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times you also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles even though margot roby and ryan gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch youre following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world but it was exactly the most profound which is fiiiine its a movie about a doll afterall but if they were going for this pov they shouldve dug deeper in my opinioni love all the actors involved and the work of greta gerwig and the work of noah baumbach but this wasnt their best worki would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion you can still enjoy the world the acting and have a laugh here and there also for people who have never taken a look at our binary sexist and patriarchal society it could be eye opening for my part i often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others particularly women so i wanted more out of the argument of the movie deeper,0.9666,positive
386,aanyasingh-90695,21-Jul-23,i loved to watch the movie it had all elements one would have want to have seen the journey of barbie to the real world was something i was really looking forward it and i am quite satisfied with it completely  the movie had lovely humour and i was completely mesmerized by ryans character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it it seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show,0.9765,positive
387,andrewdamian-06370,22-Jul-23,honestly this is the weirdest movie i have ever seen it is definitely a good movie but im not sure what to make of it the message was so convoluted that you didnt know what it was trying to saywarning the movie is not like enchanted where its a fun romantic comedy the movie is funny but it is convoluted with allegoryryan gosling and margot robbie both are fantastic american ferrera also shines will ferrell was mehmy biggest thing was wondering why they chose to make mattel cartoon feeling while at the same time trying to portray the real world youre going to come out of this movie either hating it loving it or like me wondering what the hell you just watched,0.9429,positive
388,chriswalls-08218,5-Aug-23,rarely have i seen a film that can be so heavy handed with its messaging and at others totally confusing the script is an utter mess and i felt sorry for the poor parents that brought kids along to what was very much an adult film the real world was no more real than barbieland and can anyone explain the point of will ferrells character or why he needed to go to barbielandvery few films have i every wanted to end so badly and this one ended so so badly with the inclusion of the ghost of the barbie maker just to hammer home a few more points in case you missed them just dont believe the hype or the positive reviews this film is the worst film ive seen since in a long long time,-0.9716,negative
389,coolkiasha,7-Aug-23,its a good movie worth the watch but nothing special it was really overhyped worldwide and although its a good movie its nothing special i believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better and this is below that however it tells an important story and is a somewhat fun and education movie i would rate it 65710 even though its a barbie movie kids under probably 13 wouldnt understand the movie well the moral of the story isnt just barbies and their fun little world its somewhat serious and kids would only see the barbie part and not understand the point of the movie,0.956,positive
390,bojanasormaz,20-Jul-23,i expected a funny easygoing movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone i was amazed by the depth of the story feminism done right without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases a must see if youre capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world  wasnt sure about ryan gosling as ken the match seemed off but after seeing the movie i think he did great helen mirren is the narrator which is also amazing beautiful story abour equality feminism finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world,0.9814,positive
391,gnturibi,28-Aug-23,the movie is colourful fun and had a message about the state of the world as it is today i get the feminist message but it feels like a little exposion on how the events of the plot panned out would have helped complete itthe first half went along pretty well in tems of the stirling but in the second half of felt something was missing in the conflict and eventual resolutionthst said margot robbie was born to play this role and did it marvelously and the supporting cast was great too america ferrera did well as dis ryan gosling in a convincing ken characterhowever i saw kids in the theatre and probably over 10s would get it more than younger children,0.9786,positive
392,greasefreak,21-Jul-23,this movie was fantastic leave it to the writers greta and noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well the details on the set were outstanding it even addresses some of how barbie was created being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant momenti will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater know your director this was not a film created to advertise for barbie this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for oscars they know what they want to say and why the target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie but dont let this deter you theres enough music humor and and character development for barbie and ken to keep the audience entertained even if its over their head,0.946,positive
393,anabeatriz-85741,22-Jul-23,barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way you have to think fast between laughs amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs we never goin to forget what it is see margot and ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for greta all my reverence its breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didnt expect anything different from her oscar winners here we go,0.9847,positive
394,jerankin1,21-Jul-23,although the barbie movies funny bits were good for one viewing and there were several funny bits throughout the film i think the writerdirector wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat the parodies were funny and the contrasts with real life were funny but the writers just didnt know where to go with the story in the end a lot of greta gerwigs films are like that disappointing i wouldnt see the barbie movie more than once which is sad because ive seen dial of destiny four times and i am going back for a fifth viewing that film did not disappoint this one could have been a lot better,0.8067,positive
395,cydshelton,22-Jul-23,so good but the only part i dont like is the scene when the boys take over the town apart from that its perfect barbie is a heartwarming family movie with great actors and a great freaking plot its my favorite movie and its highly recommended for a family but there some bad words like vagina and penis i think it should be recommended for 12 and over the rating 12a 12 adult  and it is 1h and 54m if u dont like comedy movies  im sure u like comedys than this movie is not for u thank u all for reading this review and i hope u read my other reviews by the way my reviews have spoilers,0.9811,positive

397,giot_lol,21-Aug-23,its impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a wellknown brandthe movie addressed a range of great themes skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytalelike presentationone of the key messages is when barbie talks to ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship exploring personal preferences and selfawareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership developing a strong selfrelationship is a foundational step before building connections with othersthe movie also transforms the traditional barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while barbies serve them this shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchya particularly touching moment is barbie creators monologue it resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of selfconfidence and fear of taking control of their livesthe film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models leading to personal dissatisfaction barbie has beenstill is an example of those models however if our real lives start being reflected into the doll we will notice how miserable and depressing we all areits sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages,-0.6124,negative
398,sarahsoderstrom,19-Jul-23,with all the hype around this film my expectations were high and were initially met the film begins as a selfaware lighthearted critique of its own legacy but as barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities whilst funny and original at first it doesnt take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script as the film transitions into a fullblown battle of the sexes despite these flaws the casting is wellexecuted with ryan gosling delivering a brilliant performance as ken unfortunately even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot,0.872,positive
399,leeyagam,21-Jul-23,"this movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman and the grief we might feel growing up as one i was so incredibly touchedmargos acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for barbieas well as ryan perfect castingi genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around methis movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen not only as the girl boss and other outdated feminist catchphrases but also as the depth we have and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasnt as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy
the thing with these type of movies is that a womans perspective and a mans perspective are completely different most women i know that watched the movie felt as i did  love grief touched and understoodthe men that have watched the movie did love it as well and some hated it because of toxic masculinity but most of them werent touched and i think that made me a little heartbroken
other than that  its truly is a feminist masterpiecei will definitely will be watching again",0.6106,positive

401,jamyejc-99032,2-Aug-23,i genuinely had planned to give the movie a 5 because it wasnt bad but it wasnt good but then the longer i have had to think after the movie i still feel that way but also like the movie was a waste of time and money i really had hoped it was going to be amazing it is barbie for crying out loud and while i have never been a huge fan of playing with them they are iconic i also felt they cast ken and barbie perfectly however the movie made little sense their are no really good amazing lines to quote and the ending was blah it wasnt very fun or funny either so i decided it gets a 2 instead of a five,0.9149,positive
402,StarzChick,6-Aug-23,the movie is fun silly and entertaining saw this in the theater which is the first time ive been in one since 2020 most people including myself for dressed up everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout after the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers thats a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll i told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that ken sings but not necessarily the one that barbie does will ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable,0.8638,positive
403,imagama,3-Aug-23,7510 very goodthis movie is very strange but also very fun it is well crafted well acted and the humour is amazing but where this movie fails is when it tries to make itself seem like a very important movie in some parts when the overall tone is lighthearted comedy the scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong but those scenes are funny as is the rest of the film i also enjoyed the direction it took with this not really being a childrens filmoverall i really enjoyed this movie it has great humour and great performances but some scenes go on for too long a very good and funny film,0.9969,positive

409,mnrmagicalstar,25-Jul-23,i enjoyed the movie a lot with many jokes and sarcasm the characters keep throwingit was interesting and unexpected view to face that barbie is a matriarchal concept on the other hand miserable but thriving kens lives with various music was very comical and fun such a landscape and worldsetting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social powermeanwhile the storyline is pretty straightforward it is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans so in that sense there was no sequence of surprise as such however it was a movie with a good length of about 90 minutes to casually enjoy watching with your family and friends,0.9749,positive
410,HorrorFan4life,5-Nov-23,i wont waste too much time but save your money its amateur storytelling and whatever message exists is terrible hands down one of the worst films ive ever seen not sure which i hated most the performances the nonsensical plot or the songs the writers kissed pretty much any worthwhile mark you could have had with this material its like the writers never heard of character arcs or bothered even writing an outline this was a hot mess i dont understand anyone liking this film almost 2 hours and 20 ill never get back on the positive notes i liked well ill think of something will farrel was wasted in this film too ugh,-0.9226,negative
411,jayceenhoward,21-Jul-23,walking into the theater i was expecting a silly outrageous fun contrast to the competing new release of oppenheimer but instead i found much more not only did this movie have incredible humor but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman the light it brought to the deep connection to mothers and daughtersespecially the moment shared between margot robbie and ruth handler was nothing short of a tearjerker not only that but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls i have seen some critics who hate magic fun and women be quick to hate on the heavy speech america ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet sure it didnt fit the theme of barbielands perfect pink atmosphere but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater i was ini left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel it spoke to me in ways that cheesy relatable lazily anticapitalist and cheap feminist media could never do this movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself i felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it i went through the hassle of making a damn imdb account and writing an essay that wasnt required by a teacher or school project i actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving kens of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie it is beautiful and a must watch,0.9945,positive
412,aprydem,11-Aug-23,honestly i loved it the colors were brilliant the usage of popular artists and actors as really well done all of the characters were brilliantly casted the it was intriguing and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences i think because of this though it just didnt hit as hard for me the messages within the movie were quite profound and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end good overall stellar for younger audiences and would 100 recommend to a younger child not my color palette so it was a bit bright not riveting just good,0.9856,positive

416,ojford,22-Aug-23,the first half is excellent it starts with a 2001 dawn of man parody with robbie as the original striped barbie in place of the monolith then shows us barbieland barbie is overrun with morbid thoughts so travels to the real world with a stowaway kenat this point it starts to lose its way  it gets bogged down in preaching against patriarchy  a word used so many times you could sip lowalcohol beer every time they say the word and be unconscious by the endcharacters give long monologues on how its literally impossible to be a woman and the barbies turn the kens against each other bizarrely by using their sex appeal to evoke jealousy is that really a feminist messagewhatever they were trying to say here it doesnt come across well its preachy onthenose and too unbelievable to communicate a real message other films like gone girl with its cool girl monologue or comedies like bad moms make the point this movie seems to be trying to make much more effectivelybarbieland looks amazing and the first sections there are fun the whole patriarchy messaging was wisely cut out of the trailers it would have been better to make this a fool triumphant story like legally blonde where stereotypical barbie as robbies barbie is known is seen as an airheaded bimbo in the real world yet proves herself,0.9676,positive

422,efe-49832,20-Jul-23,as i said at the beginning of the article i lost my expectations before watching the movie because of the trailers it felt like they were going on a story especially one that would end up with big problems in the future i will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions but barbie is hiding with a pretty wellwritten script he uses drama in the parts that should be serious and humor in the parts from that moment on the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better moreover when the editing is at a fluent pace you watch the movie breathlessly the fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years,0.8674,positive

424,coraloughreyobrien,31-Jul-23,i thought all the jokes were really funny and i felt a bit sorry for ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken ryan gosling wants is to be noticed by barbie margot robbie and when he goes to the real world and discovers that its all about men and horses and he freaks out  i also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde  i also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met ruth and ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie  everything was pink i can see how there was a shortage of pink paint  and it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie  so to all the cast directors  singers  producers and people involved well done  it was amazing and it will give girls a lot off confidence for a long time ,0.9824,positive
425,nsbsnvp,20-Jul-23,i watched this over the weekend and i can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful this is a darkgritty wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon themes of feminism social roles corporate greed aging legacies and divine intervention it reads like a piece from epic poetry as if the gods themselves had come down and made it this is definitely the movie of 2023 and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing i had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and i loved margot robbies take on barbie loved this movie,0.979,positive
426,pakeeyaraj,14-Aug-23,barbie is not just a stereotypical hollywood film to celebrate the wellknown brand but it dives in deeper into more self existence gender equality and journey of life the messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all barring the mattel company staff scenes and characters that doest not land they are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film  the third act feels overbloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start the actors  robbie gosling  ferrera are standouts,0.9052,positive
427,mmeikle-35241,11-Aug-23,this movie was a pleseant surprise it managed to strike an excellent balance between adult and child themes and essentially all of the humor lands welltowards the end it gets a little preachy with a certain characters speech which takes away from the movie a bit the speech itself just felt odd and was a bit on the nose compared to the rest of the movie but they managed to tie it all up at the end of the movie fairly nicely so i am willing to overlook that i really enjoyed the overall approach they took to the barbie movie and it had many little humorous surprisesid highly reccomend the movie it was a fun time and even now the theatres are still packed,0.965,positive
428,trade-44842,1-Aug-23,i enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters sympathy than for the confusing message is it that ken should understand he was created to be barbies friend forever is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place i hope i can read the actual purpose of the story from the writersbarbieland is shown as a happy monotonous humanlike world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world please if anyone finds out the actual message let me know,0.9488,positive

the over the board marketing and publicity esp about the ip products
lack of subtletyfeels too preachy at some pointsthe mattel scenes were little too sillylike
satire hits hard most of the timeunapologetic and audacious approacha strong message and way it is deliveredthe motherdaughter dynamics at most timesproduction design and color palletsmargot robbie and our guy ryan almost perfectly playing their partsgreta gerwigs directionnow onto some spoilery biti think most people just want to gets triggered without putting much thought behind this they missed the main pointwe have to remember that it is a satire and both the barbie land and real world are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need i think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more importantalso i support how at the end how they didnt just give the kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment in that fictional world the barbies were more qualified by design to hold those positions and all the kens have just been are side characters with no real talents other than being the eye candys to the barbies upliftment on basis of gender and not merittalent is never a sign of a healthy society  but from now onwards it will not be barbieand ken but its barbie and its ken i think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world355  05 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale it will be a 3rd4th in my list of greta gerwigs work",0.8143,positive

432,willphelan,11-Nov-23,margot robbie is the best possible choice to play barbie and ryan gosling is terrific as ken its a very interesting story and not one i would automatically expect from a barbie movie but i love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles it shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have female in barbie land and male in the real world and we see why its important to try and understand everyones perspective i also love how this movie dives into mens mental health with kens arc its something that gets overlooked in society and i adore how we got to see ken learn to come to terms with who he is without barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself the movie gives a great arc to barbie as she tries to understand her purpose she realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isnt what she wants anymore there are so many beautiful scenes where barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human at first she starts off thinking that shes a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to she becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real its a great story and greta gerwig did a brilliant job directing the set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful the movie is also very funny and the details and references to barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie the music is incredible there are so many songs in here that are great but ryan goslings performance of im just ken and billie eilishs what was i made for are my favorites they do a great job representing the themes of the movie if i had some complaints i think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall barbie is a success 810,0.9987,positive

437,hobbsdavidwork,6-Aug-23,a movie that delivered a great few laughs with gosling taking the show margot was fantastic really showcasing her talent as an actor however for the main character of the show it did not seem that way  ken took most of the limelight rightfully so with ryan playing a stellar partthe story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy while granted in this day and age theres a limit to the level of guff one can takea colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be probably not a good idea to bring young kids as the premise and message will go over their heads,0.9261,positive
438,justpronouncedkiiddo,23-Jul-23,"i saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience however ive needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that i wasnt sure how to feel about first ken the character himself was hilarious and ryan gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice i loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking like the guy just wanted to learn about horses but pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere so ken being naive just falls into it as well as the societal expectation of needing to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent leading into incel ideologythe thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end after he became his normal self it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again like i still dont wanna be rooting for this guy seeing peoples response to him as a character after the movie had me confused i understand ryan gosling is so fine but ken is not your babygirl he still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologizedthe plot with the realworld mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me it was funny dont get me wrong but it just kind of happened and i wasnt sure what to glean from it at one point i found myself thinking like what happened to those guys and then they just kinda showed up at the end i also know it was meant to be commentary on mattels predominantly male leadership but like you are mattel you have a male ceo like thanks for addressing it but you have no room to talki think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point couldve been used to touch a bit more on body image issues because that is a huge criticism of the barbie brand like okay you had one token fat barbie with an otherwise entirely straightsized cast but some of the jokes were just like pregnant people are weird  and they never entirely said hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens
i think they tried to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across i think it couldve been pretty easy to incorporate a scene like when barbie tried tea for the first time to be like wow indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral valuedespite my criticisms i would say this movie is a mustwatch the points it makes are really important and i actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe which is rare for me with these types of filmsmore of a 7510 than a 7 if i had to say",0.9978,positive

440,thedarkhorizon,26-Aug-23,i found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic satire story telling again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity by the end i was moved to tears for barbie and ken it represented to me many issues of modern times and things i was confronted with in real life the candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer i found the barbieworld of course mesmerizing melancholic and so well done i hope apart from all the social media hype it will do some good in the world heals girls women boys and men and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth it is and was the hardest lesson to learn for me,0.9524,positive
441,livioborio,23-Jul-23,the films marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers had i not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film i would have been taken aback expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventureinstead barbie turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society while the central idea is commendable the execution fell somewhat short for me the plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed and i could foresee the unfolding events and the movies conclusionundoubtedly the movies core message is strong but i couldnt fully embrace its realization i agree with the critics observations regarding the onedimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending despite the intentionsstill barbie has several strengths the visual style is captivating and the beauty of barbieland is truly enchanting in addition the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characterson the downside some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior which detracts from the overall balance also the treatment of the kens raised some concerns and left room for improvementin conclusion barbie tackles an important and relevant issue but it could have been executed more effectively despite its shortcomings the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances,0.9935,positive

455,venompool-68826,26-Jul-23,at the beginning it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal but not merely as a reversal both gender groups retain their essence and the ending isnt about one groups victory over the other but about working together it encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself its not about feminism patriarchy or gender confrontation its not about stereotypes or perfectionism its about gender equality embracing individuality and mutual understanding this movie isnt exclusively for women it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou middle school syndrome in both genders outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichs,0.9408,positive
456,frankiek33,5-Aug-23,very entertaining and fun does not take itself too seriously very good satirical acting props and set building is very creative and indepth ryan gosling is great and really funny the plot and message are annoying though starts from the beginning with a very delusional message and does not let up even though i tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout the ending makes no sense barbie herself ends up not solving her problem still being confused and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie that makes no sense whatsoever the very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too the director obviously did not know how to end the movie,0.8297,positive
457,andrapreda,22-Jul-23,this movie is nothing like i expected and i love it greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama i laughed i almost cried and it was just the best experiencehaving moments when i just loved seeing the interpretation of the barbie world moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry there was nothing i didnt love about this movie and i cant stress this enoughoverall this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and i wish that everyone could have the same experience that i did,0.9798,positive
458,kimberlyconner-30872,26-Jul-23,the barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable the costumes and sets were great and added to the barbie nostalgia ken was probably my favorite part watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love and finally finding himself outside of barbie at the end of the movie i even enjoyed the overthetop portrayal of the patriarchy it was hilarious however i felt the ending fell flat maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse but i felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the kens to the point that it didnt feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all it felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the kens and laughing it off as funny sure they gave them some minor administrative role at the end but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong like it ended with the barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth it happened as part of the finale the final focus of the film overall i highly enjoyed the movie but the ending really made me leave feeling let down,0.9882,positive
459,javierfcontreras,25-Sep-23,the only thing you can save here is how good margot robbie looks other than that this movie is more than sad i really have a hard time understanding why ryan gosling accepted to play such a pathetic partshallow pointless and ridiculous they really had a good cast and the script is full of endless nonsense and pointless conversationsit mixes intentions to try to make barbie look good but at the same time makes adult like comments that dont make it kid friendlyi wish the money could be returned because this was not worth it better luck next timethe 71 review on imdb is completely deceiving,0.6141,positive
460,aruminger,21-Jul-23,this movie is awesome unexpected in so many good ways addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun fair and thoughtful way what a joyful blend of comedy music color and memories from childhood every frame is filled with so much visual candy and if you ever owned a barbie or ken or skipper or alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets the actors editing directing writing and set design are a solid 10 i dont think the previews do this movie justice it was so much more than i expected mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off kudos to the believers of this script it is so worth seeing once twice three times and then some,0.9864,positive
461,ang_swee_boon,1-Aug-23,barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist the main standout truly is the costume design highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the barbie concept borrowing elements from the chanels haute couture collection to some of the rarest outfits from barbie it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art even the extrasminor characters were wearing beautiful pieces some of the best costume design ive seen over the yearsthe plot was rather textbook but definitely enjoyed the witty subtle jokes which created good tension and suspension wellbalanced and great character development for most characters except for sasha who changed opinions just too quickly for my taste,0.9828,positive
462,nenasarec,22-Jul-23,the production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful same goes to the most of the cast with beautiful attention to detial uncluding actual cars and houses that we played withbut the message of patriarchy is bad seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men and i dont believe in battling hate with hate dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering world dominated by men but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal which the barbie word is pinning us against each other is not helpful as we should work together to reach equality one cannot work without the other what could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste,0.6633,positive
463,nmiodrag-40072,16-Aug-23,"as far as im concerned the first half of the movie was simply boring to me and the attempts at humor on that level were just ugh yes the message is fine though very simplified  men bad women good i agree that equality is important and i liked the conclusion that kens need to find their own purpose of course i didnt miss the gay undertones with the kens flexing on the beach with beers and the greaselike choreography where a black and yellow ken give gosling kisses on the cheeks and then shake it off with a what was that  id gladly pay a ticket for that action  and theres also a gay vibe with allan and the cubicle guy from mattel i also liked weird barbie and ruth the mattel board was a very coarse caricature to meall in all a mixed bag  there are good moments but the bad ones outweigh them for me i dont regret watching it but i wouldnt do it againits symptomatic to me that an oppenheimer barely collects 650 million and these guys double that and itll probably be even more
and that bit at the end with the gynecologist i expected barbie to get a job at mattel as the new ruth but no the message to the girls was to go to the gynecologist facepalm",0.3266,positive

first of all i really loved this movie i think its fun and entertaining and i really think its done with a lot a passion for the original material the references are clever and i couldnt help but smile each time i saw a barbie i had as a child specially midge i loved her its a very colorful movie and its so refreshing to see that specially with all the gray movies we get nowadays the characters in barbie land are fun and innocent it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way its filmed the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child plus i really loved ken and i think ryan gosling did a great job he was hilarious the kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for mehowever this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasnt for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the moviefirst of all the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this partthe scene where a man simply smacks barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings more so the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and i really didnt like them coming to the barbie world the deprogramming all the barbies was too forced for me and i would prefer if barbie herself did thatwhich leads me to the final part the politicsafter seeing the real world patriarchy ken a character that lived his whole life just to please barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that is he right no of course not but i think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment and for me the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end but it didnt i mean it did a little bit but not enough in my opinion it would have been awesome if the barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them but instead they chose to make a joke that the kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world it really missed the point of making barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and womenanyway this my review of the movie and in conclusion close kenough to a perfect movie",0.9987,positive
465,kacpermrugala,7-Aug-23,good movie but nothing special good quality funny and this all after leaving the cinema i had the feeling that i was watching a long corporate propaganda about barbie but that was probably it clearly mattel wanted to improve the opinion of barbie dolls based on feminist themes and the problem of gender inequality however there is a strong feeling that this topic was used as a marketing manipulation good cast and acting film for both children and adults lots of references to barbie doll jokes margot robbie played really great here without her this movie would be much weakerif you go to the cinema you will probably be satisfied but if you dont go you wont lose anything strong 6,0.9773,positive

468,shakyblakey,22-Jul-23,barbie was certainly unique it has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience it does have moments of comedy but dont expect any other sorts of genres both ryan gosling and margot robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always greta gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable this movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves if you have young children they will certainly enjoy it but if not i wouldnt recommend it to you,0.9795,positive
469,vicky_vance,18-Sep-23,the film is an enchanting mixture of sitcom satire on consumer society and philosophy where they dragged in everything they possibly could from pinocchio to the bible at the same time the movie seems like a sketch from a talkshow that parodies cliches associated with the barbie subcultureall the most important things happen towards the end when barbie faces a dilemma on a universal scale to remain a doll in an ideal doll world or to become a real ordinary person there is no single correct choice here you either live in a delusional bliss or face the harsh realityin general the impression of the film can be expressed in a phrase they wanted to say a lot of things at once but along the way they also got lost in their grandiose attempt at philosophy nevertheless the film turned out to be funny adults will enjoy reading the philosophical ideas hidden here and for children there is a bright dynamic story and several smart ideas presented in understandable language,0.9652,positive

471,saxonlydon,24-Aug-23,while this movie is worth seeing and contains some humorous moments as well as ryan goslings im just ken being one of the highlights i wasnt a fan of the men vs women portrayal and the plot wasnt the best for example why did the mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the kens brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long however it is worth noting that the costume and set design was astonishing and enhanced the experience of the movie,0.6085,positive

474,ramon-vermij,24-Jul-23,up to 80 of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities reflecting and criticising society the cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scenes came in the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then the songs had real impact it made for some good fun and laughsas for the remaining 20 it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose,0.9407,positive

479,ChungusAficionado,25-Jul-23,this movie has an absurdist quality about it that i cant really explain almost like early 2000s ben stiller movies like zoolander or tropic thunder that makes you feel as if you hallucinated the whole thing in that regard another comparison is monty pythons flying circus and the sort of delightful wittiness of the showbarbie is profoundly silly and strange and an extremely high effort production reflected in the spectacular set design ryan gosling is absolutely perfect for the role so much that he steals the show the result is that barbie is almost completely unlike anything else you would see at the cinemasi don t think the film is perfect or anything the ending for me felt a bit unsatisfying for ken at least and the film also contains a car commercial for some reason at the end of the day even if you disagree or have problems with the feminist argument that the film makes the film will have you smiling like an idiot most of the time in a way that not many other pieces of media can,0.7629,positive
480,ed-12055,22-Jul-23,i loved the set design acting and personal development of the characters the nuance and meaning but didnt like the rushed storyline production obviously invested a great deal in the set design barbie dream houses and wardrobes it was pink everything with blue beach with a plastic vibe it was cool how they incorporated the barbie box and different outfits something i loved as a child i also thought tv barbie was a blast from the past 90s baby here and learned about other dolls like midge skipper and alan also they didnt do poor midge any justice she was played by a terrific actress so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character i thought alan was played very well thoughi thought that margot robbie and ryan gosling played their characters perfectly capturing their characters development and different nuances you could definitely see barbies transformation into a human but margot did a good job at keeping barbie at her core even in human formsome of my favorite storylines included the war of the kens the discovery of patriarchy the brainwashing of the barbies and the takeover of the barbies  againhowever the switch to the real world and back felt rushed as well as the relationship development between sasha and gloria and barbie really what should have happened was a two part movie to fully tell the story or a 3 hour movie i also felt they spent too much time in barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting boredfor example sasha and gloria meet barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to barbie world i felt like barbie should have had to work to make them believe her making the discovery of barbie world by sasha and gloria even sweeter and barbies transformation into human even more complex i wish i got to see her learn more about becoming human i absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end but felt that could have been earlier in the movie with the scene with ruth at the endi couldnt discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism it could have easily been both if there was more time spent on barbies transformation to human maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to barbie,0.9979,positive

482,hassisrus,31-Jul-23,hilarious fun poignant smart and satirical as a middleaged mother of 4 i related to gloria so much and i cried boy did i cry much like everyone everywhere all at once i felt seen for all the critics of the movie my response is 1 quoting jack nicholson you cant handle the truth and 2 its satire folks but like most satire it flies over the heads of many many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way but others are subtle not going because you dont want to support what youve heard is a political side well thats just ridiculous give yourself more credit than that,0.6044,positive
483,heccafast,26-Jul-23,the social commentary was pretty heavyhanded albeit this is to be expected in the barbie movie however it was genuinely funny a lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm there were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once plot was a cute but could have been smarter its nice to see a new movie that isnt just a remake or a sequel but i fully expect to see a franchise for this i appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism in one the of the final scenes the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is,0.9795,positive

487,faithfedericaojo,23-Jul-23,barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects from its comedic moments to its unique charm the world it presents is filled with vibrant colors whimsical settings lively music and a sense of fantasy and extravagance visually speaking the film is truly unmatched the actors delivered commendable performances with special applause going to margot robbie and ryan gosling however i must admit that i personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film they struck me as particularly funnywhere the story loses points is in its confusing message while the film clearly aims to promote gender equality the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative it wasnt so much the fact that the pep talks were about women but rather the way they were integrated into the story i want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism as a woman myself i appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtlyi found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film such as alan and several of the barbieskens lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes additionally i would have liked to see more exploration of barbie land and its unique characteristics on a positive note the message about the transient nature of ones life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting,0.9847,positive

491,Gmanthemoviereviewer,26-Jul-23,opposite of my expectations overall i thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny ryan gosling was fantastic as ken and the kens as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie the set design was knocked out of the park it was the perfect look of barbie land and it really immersed you in it lastly i thought the little details in the movie were awesome like as if somebody was playing with barbie like when she floats down from her house the shower water is imaginary and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary i love little details like that and gerwig killed it with thosebut just like everyone has been talking about id like to talk about the message this movie is pushing i overall didnt feel like they were straight man hating but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didnt take away from the overall experience for me the part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic ahole was a bit much for me i am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit imagine you take your young daughter to see this its gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing upthe characters of america ferreras daughter and the mattel higher ups were absolutely worthless to the plot i mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b to barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the diversiontwist that her mom is the one that needed barbies helpmy main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending ken comes back from earth with patriarchal ideals and takes over barbie land and i honestly couldnt tell if they were supposed to be the so on villains of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie because i never really felt like they were bad guys ken was treated like crap by barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him the end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast its like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull womens emotional stringspsa this is not a kids movie definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women most of the humor in it is adult level humorbut overall i came into this movie thinking i would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it,0.9518,positive

493,hardday-48075,22-Jul-23,"im only writing this due to the misperception of this movie i saw the movie opening night with my gf who loved and still loves barbie she is stereotypical barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time if youre a fan of barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love itin fact if you are a fan of barbie i suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experiencehowever for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men i would like to ask if you watched the same movie neither men nor women were the target in this movie this movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general it is established quite early on that the barbies and kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance as soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie that is aside from the inclusion of ordinary people by mattels introduction of ordinary barbie which seems to serve as further evidence of mattel claiming self awareness hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making barbie in the first place finally barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of mattel  an old woman honestly ladies this is your real enemy in life lol men are pretty useless as depicted old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress youthe movie however seemed to say these things through mockery
1 if you treat men like the barbies treat the kens you will become one option of many as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends2  when your old like barbie you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina however even though ken is old and unbelievably dumb and useless he still gets to live in barby dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful barbys which just seems to reinforce the supposedly patriarchal concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women3  if youre young and pretty for women or just pretty for men you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with real problems4  there in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality as long as your good enough you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in realitythat being said the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie aside from america ferrara we do not like her as an audience lol superstore proved this her patronizing speech is an insult to womens intellects and the low point of the movie goslings accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight i dont understand why men are upset by this how gosling was portrayed in this movie is exactly how i have seen him my entire life lolid rate barby as sublime",0.9799,positive
494,officialerrt,21-Jul-23,people who followed all the lawsuits and all the barbies throughout the years it broke every single hollywood law in the books mattel made satire out of their own overprotection of the barbie product margot robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in barbie this is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely hate barbie it is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movieknow your barbie history before coming to the movie know the lawsuits which mattel brought to those who used barbie as satire 64 years of history inone hour and fiftyfour minutes,-0.7125,negative
495,aidandrain15,24-Jul-23,going into the movie i went in mostly blind and didnt expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline cast was starstudded and everything seemed to be in place nothing off there however to me the movie couldnt decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline i think the humor was wellexecuted but the movie leaned too much into both sides by doing that the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished excellent individual performances from ferrell gosling and greenblatt,0.852,positive
496,ryanm-63239,27-Jul-23,"it has great moments the beginning might be the strongest ive ever seen unique the soundtrack has a few songs that fall flat but overall it was very strong cinematography was unreal calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool the writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times its not dark weird and crazy to have thoughts about death that was just a strange choice margot robbie had the best performance by fari really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a womanrun government i get what theyre doing i get its not a real place but then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts when four women sit on the supreme court today joke about them just not being able to be president or something if you want it to hit homei think when people call this movie preachy theyre mostly talking about america ferreras speech a lot of the points are valid but idk aboutand it turns out in fact that not only are you doing
everything wrong but also everything is your faultnever fall down never fail never show fearmaybe in finance bro world i still think the movie is wellintentioned you should and they do preach equalityi think legally blonde handled the same message better you see people not taking her seriously throughout it felt more developed like yes all these things are disadvantages that should change but youre already overcoming them while not shedding any femininity you may enjoy",0.9895,positive

498,lizzie_francis,22-Jul-23,i would probably feel more positive about the film if it hadnt been hyped up so much in the marketing and press junketsthe first half of the film is essentially the trailer and the second half doesnt deliver anything profound i was disappointed the conversation on femininity and what it means to be a woman didnt develop past what is already in pop culture yes we know there are high standards for beautythe second half of the film becomes a mess with the meaning that theyd set up in the first part of the film falling apart the scene dedicated to breaking up with ken was plain confusing to me the part where she becomes a human even more so and then the gynaecologist appointment ugh i probably needed to have a very different sense of humour to watch this film despite the fact i find ryan gosling hilarious in other thingsi got the to the end thinking is that it,0.6697,positive
499,yellowsub10,22-Jul-23,this was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times also the product placement and clear control from mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times honestly it is unique and not something really done before so it gets points for that its a lot though just a lot going on and not all of what was going on was necessaryalso ryan gosling is not the best singer or dancer it was cheesy and over the top im glad i saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service id probably turn it off as it was so weird its worth watching so youre in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become,0.9391,positive
500,Batsy1501,4-Sep-23,the script is wellwritten with engaging complexity a remarkable script that transformed into an excellent film all of the castings are top tier i cant imagine another barbie other than margot the sounds and visuals are admittedly not too prominent but it also contributes significantly to the emotional orientation which was done nicely however the film could have done better in developing the supporting characters its truly amazing that a film like this could do so well at the box office compared to other billiondollar movies and i think im not the only one hoping that there wont be a sequel its much better standing alone,0.991,positive
501,tiheimbaugh,5-Sep-23,barbie is gerwiglite just far too selfaware for its own good to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics gerwig and baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience hey were aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but were still having fun which fine but gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to political astuteness doesnt make for very entertaining or memorable film dialoguealso i long for the often hintedat version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly although i guess the ending sort of posits it as not for everyone but again you see my point as to how overwritten this is the production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe the soundtrack is rife with bland focusgroup pop and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all hollywood movies postcovid seem to have i suppose plastic is appropriate for a movie about americas favorite doll but i watched some of the thin red line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans were able to make beautifullooking movies its indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyones said it is but it could have been so much moremajor points deducted for uncalledfor digs at pavement and the godfather plenty of women love both,0.9878,positive
502,keehntara,26-Jul-23,the movie started out fun and strong i agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent set design superb etc however the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better directionwhat i liked it emphasized how with barbiedolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything unfortunately in the real world patriarchy exists and were limited i liked it didnt marry barbie off to ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happywhat i didnt like the stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in barbie land that things got confusing and hard to follow why exactly were all barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical barbiei wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the kens and the barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs maybe ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over barbies dream house he gets acknowledged and gets his space too maybe he hooks up with midge because he moves on maybe he gets a beach house so he can beach off whenever he wants i dont know it was funny i laughed out loud several times glad i saw it just wish they went some different directions,0.9859,positive
503,klretheridge,29-Jul-23,great film which has a good balance between politics feminism and film making it was funny sad and exciting with great acting to pull it off the set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line the ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they werent necessary to be discontinued overall a great film and good to see with the family it would be really recommended if you have younger children they should love it,0.9853,positive
504,leila-73758,6-Aug-23,i was super excited to see this movie but im coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed the marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what i expect and so my expectations were very high there were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message i think this film is a little late maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesnt add much value to the feminist cause its worth seeing as its definitely of cultural interest but i wont be rewatching it,0.9895,positive
505,myrthewoddema,27-Aug-23,most movie buffs have hated modern trailers for quite some time now its annoying that it often has to contain such an epic version of an existing pop song but the worst thing is that they often show the entire film in short  and then also exactly as it goes in the film the creators of barbie understood that the first half hour contains enough material to use only its footage to capture the audiences interest what follows next is a wonderful surprisebarbie is a mirror to a major problem in society that many people dont even see in its entirety because its so deeply ingrainedthanks,-0.6174,negative
506,Comics4U,18-Oct-23,i was deciding on a movie to watch when eventually i decided on the barbie movie because why not i went in thinking this would be a childish type movie but i was actually quite surprised to say the least i can see where people are coming from with all the negativity but i personally did not mind it the camerawork was pretty good the acting was good though it can get cheesy at certain times the story wasnt bad but it wasnt perfect or amazing but the best thing about the movie is how fun it is you can sit down after school work stressful or busy day and you just lay back and have a good time i do recommend it to people who want a fun experience although if your looking for a serious action filled 10 star movie this is probably not for you,0.9786,positive
507,ninadenonaadi,1-Aug-23,everything was just so perfect the cast margot robbie is basically my fav person and ryan is also nice ig i love how they added some actors from sex education like emma connor and ncuti the design was unbelievably perfect as well the soundtrack the message everything i just loved this movie so much it was so fun to watch it felt relatable felt so many kinds of emotions at once which was an amazing and unique experience loved it greta and margot did so well i also loved how there were so many kinds of barbies like transgender barbie allan which i think is nonbinary and more,0.9938,positive
508,juliadillon-13606,24-Jul-23,i went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything this movie turned out to be everything a barbieloving thirtysomething needed twenty years ago expertly cast the barbie movie is hilariously selfaware and has no dull moments though the micheal is obviously mainly about barbie ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplotthe movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end the attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you make sure you wear pink we would see it again and again,0.9549,positive
509,hjs44,17-Sep-23,its a fine fun movie but will never be a classic one like 2001 or matrix that makes you want to watch it repeatedly imo but definitely not a bad oneid like to share my perspective on the end part that seems leaving some ppl confused even after showing all the difficulties obstacles and overcome between the two sexes the only thing that matters is that we can procreate as humans otherwise all the messages homages jokes history and thoughts shared in the film will become meaningless without human existence i dont know much about the director but even if she is a truly thoughtful feminist or not the challenge of sublimating all the human themes to the simplest message at the ending scene should be evaluated properlyas it went a bit dull and clichelike throughout the film it really looked like barbiebarbara was going to have a job interview or something in that scene so was a nice unexpected ending blow to me yes she seemed happy being pregnantat least she didnt look like she had an std to me and it concludes the story neatly,0.9867,positive
510,mwcrunner-81576,23-Sep-23,now i know a lot of people especially women like barbie a lot but this movie was just too cringe to me the story was weird the acting was a bit off not very many characters were likable and it was also very weird seeing ryan gosling sing a song in this movie and hes not even that very good of a singer i dont think this movie should even be nominated for an oscar for best picture its probably likely that it will be nominated for a razzie for most cringe movie ever the ending wasnt that great either sure we got to meet barbies creator but it still wasnt very good 3 out of 10 for this,0.5445,positive

513,HarlequeenStudio,8-Aug-23,this film quickly loses the plot and so do you i feel like the writers decided to put everything in it and address every audience everything everywhere all at once 2022 does it successfully so does the matrix 1999 and when it comes to visiting parallel worlds or escapism beauties of the night 1952 or even alice in wonderland 1951 are far better paroles paroles paroles thats what barbies all about actually everything in this movie sounds old tired and stale people will talk 1951 still sounds fresh comparing to this or kiss and make up 1934 that also deals with malefemale relationships and beauty standardssome of the films about empowerment and diversity that beat barbie on every possible level are the iron jawed angels 2004 million dollar baby 2004 boys dont cry 1999 amelia 2009 amlie 2001 little miss sunshine 2006 the heiress 1949 mildred pierce 1945 kitty foyle 1940 ninotchka 1939 9 to 5 1980 working girl 1988 precious 2009 the color purple 1985 hairspray 1988 my beautiful laundrette 1985 midnight in the garden of good and evil 1997 the first wives club 1997 alien 1979 halloween 1978 trading places 1988 and the list goes on hilary swank is in four of them so give that girl an extra cookie also all of katharine hepburn glenda jackson bettie davis barbara stanwyck mae west marlene dietrich and joan crawford films exude empowerment you dont have to figure it out it will simply posses youthe visuals in barbie seem ai im not a fan of digital effects so maybe thats why i wasnt impress i grew up watching classic hollywood musicals the choreography the dancing  singing skills the costumes and all of that in technicolor or in beautiful black and white was so much more effective than this all that jazz 1979 american in paris 1951 gentlemen prefer blondes 1953 the red shoes 1948 lady in the dark 1944 all of fred  ginger films and those choreographed by busby berkeley are far more spectacular and better produced than barbiethe characters are not sympathetic to me and the cathartic moment in the film when barbie achieves her humanity by discarding ken is also the moment when i dont care what she does the movie has already been too long there has already been a lot of senseless running around in and out of barbieland like watching too many episodes of the latest turkish soap opera with your mum the drama the subversion the subversion of the subversion the flat feet the cellulite the arrest the chase with the men in black the meeting with your maker i wouldnt care if the two of them ended up going on a holiday with slavoj zizek though that would be something so in conclusion if you want to see a heartwarming movie about a doll that becomes human i recommend pinocchio 1940,0.9865,positive

517,marsege,20-Jul-23,if youre making brand films each of his directors reveals his own vision and that vision generally lacks some points however i think greta gerwig knew all aspects of barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly margot robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes in fact when barbie is mentioned the role is wellaccepted of course barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie by writing ken as a onedimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story he significantly increased the directors of the movie games ryan gosling had a great acting frankly he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen for the other barbie and ken players the states didnt show much of a performance maybe kate mckinnon there were no such important scenes anyway but america ferrera didnt do a great job despite having a very available house i wouldnt say that i played badly but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion,0.8215,positive

534,asderei,24-Jul-23,barbie the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of barbies objectification falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes while the films attempt to address social issues and promote selfconfidence among girls is commendable its approach feels onesided and counterproductiveon the positive side barbie does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively the movies soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes bilie eilishs song what was i made for sang by margot robbie and ryan gosling performance in im just ken are the standoutsunfortunately the film takes a heavyhanded approach in addressing gender issues instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding barbie seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progressthe portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush by portraying all male characters as either stupid childish immature or disrespectful towards women the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes alienating a significant portion of its potential audience including male viewers and responsible male role modelsadditionally the excessive focus on harassment groping and dirty looks that barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movies message instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics it leans heavily on extreme examples potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address,0.7506,positive

2023s barbie from writerdirector greta gerwig has blown expectations out of the water and not only become the highest grossing film of the year but has captured the zeitgeist to become a veritable cultural phenomenon the film is a fantasy comedy starring margot robbie and ryan gosling with significant supporting roles going to america ferrera issa rae kate mckinnon simu liu rhea perlman and will ferrell the movie is cowritten by gerwigs partner noah baumbach there have been more than a few animated barbie films but this is her first foray into live action as august 2023 comes to an end barbie has set box office records becoming the highest grossing film of the year the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman and is in the top twenty highest grossing films of all timerobbie stars as barbie technically stereotypical barbie and gosling is ken most commonly referenced as beach ken they reside in barbieland which is a matriarchal utopia where many variations of barbies and kens reside in perfect happiness along with a few odd discontinued barbie models these real life dolls are under the impression that life in the real world reflects their happy unencumbered existence in barbieland thanks not in small part to their very existence and the example they set out of the blue barbie begins having odd feelings of morbidity and her perfectness is deteriorating it is determined that her malaise is a reflection of the child playing with her in the real world and she must journey there and set things aright if she is to get her perfect barbie groove back ken joins her and together they venture to the real world which is not the carefree paradise they believed along with that barbie and ken discover the nature of the real world patriarchy which ken attempts to bring back to barbieland threatening its very existence it becomes barbies mission to not only save the girl who has her doll in the real world but also restore barbieland from the lunacy of the kens burgeoning patriarchywhen i first heard barbie was being adapted i was more than a bit skeptical i was intrigued after learning gerwig and baumbach were attached as they are at the forefront of some of the more intelligent film making coming out of hollywood these days still how exactly would barbie play this could be a silly film that turns into a financial disaster instead it walked a hyper intelligent line of silly comedy mixed with incisive social satire and feminist messaging it doesnt do it in a way that talks down to or belittles men though which is also key to an overall success it taps a similar vein that black panther tapped a few years ago for the black community here though it taps the often under served female portion of our population from the opening scene that is a pantomime of the famous 2001 a space odyssey opening it is clear that this is a film maker in control of her craft and the story she is about to embark on especially in this day and age a very blatant feminist core message might not sell but it does its task in such a fun and subversive way encased in a bright candy coated shell with catchy music that it is hard not to get on board if there is any misunderstanding though the message certainly becomes clear in the epic diatribe that is delivered by america ferrera as gloria on what it is like and the expectation placed upon being a woman in our modern society barbie does an excellent job of dissecting the seeming dichotomy of barbie itself that is on one hand the dolls are meant to be empowering for women as the myriad of different barbies come with different careers and different skin tones and are meant to show young girls that they can be anything on the other hand barbie has become a negative stereotype for a perfect unattainable idea of womanhood that contributes to many normal girls feeling inadequate in themselves for a myriad of reasons it has hilarious and pointed commentary on the nature of the patriarchy as goslings ken put the concept in place in barbieland to both hilarious and appalling effect about the only thing that didnt work for me in the story is the mattel board of directors they are yet another example of the real world patriarchy headed by ferrells character the problem is that the real world is set up as more or less a realistic depiction of life in direct counterpoint to the fantasy world that is barbieland the exception to that appears to be mattel and its board of directors which skew towards slapstick lunacy and seem out of place in the primarily real world setting that aside barbie is fun and insightful i think it is clearly targeted toward women and girls especially those with barbie experience but it clearly becomes about women as whole along with that it is accessible to men who go in with an open mind and realize that even as the struggle for equality and self fulfillment has come a long way since 1959 that road continues on and does not dead end in the present",0.9977,positive

how wonderful it is that margot robbie was chosen to perform this role she did it perfectly",0.991,positive
566,zfrjdfd,21-Jul-23,i loved this movie more than i thought i would i laughed cried and honestly loved the message all the niche references made me smile toonormally i do not rewatch movies while they are in theaters but i am planning on taking my sibling this weekend so they can experience the same joyi dont understand the people who are upset over ken being an accessory to barbie it is literally pointed out in the movie how misogyny is a huge problem in the real world and they are upset over one validating movie unbelievable please ignore the antiman reviews this movie isnt antiman if anything its antipatriarchy and makes fun of it,0.836,positive
567,mfgkqwcx,25-Jul-23,outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline gosling once again shows that hes in a class of his own barbie started out fun but shortly into the film the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse the room changes from lighthearted laughter excitement and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily our fun and bubbly barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche hashedout stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from ryan gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story,0.9779,positive
568,flotreri,27-Jul-23,it exceeded my expectations truly an amazing film everything was gorgeous the actors were perfect for their roles the music was awesome im just ken is top tier the plot was super interesting the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed orand got cancelled through the decadesit think its a movie that has a significant impact after watching is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand i recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy i cried twice during the film and great sense of humor but if you are a kid you can also watch it even though you will not undestand it a 100 is visually pleasant,0.9726,positive
569,joshwb-31737,1-Aug-23,barbie was so much better than i expected it to be i thought it would be fun but it definitely nailed everything it went forwhile not taking itself seriously as a comedy it still manages to touch on important topics like inequality it holds up a mirror that will make some people feel uncomfortable and this can be seen by some reviews calling it preachythe performances were so perfect for their respective characters and they did a good job of establishing everyones role in the story the story itself had great pacing and kept you interested the whole way throughoutthe great thing about barbie is that it touches on worlds dominated by either men or women are both wrong and the key is finding balance and equality the barbie showing opposite sides of the real worldit also had great positive masculinity especially during the ken fight they could have just gone for a generic case of them fighting each others and looking like they cant control themselves instead they had them overcome their differences and appreciate each otheri also appreciate they gave ken a good ending too having his character not be defined by being with barbie and instead being proud of just being himself which again parallels the pressure on women being defined by their partnera certain crowd wont understand any of the points made by this movie and will just call it preachy some reviews ive read on here have definitely not watched the movieits a fun comedy that will make you laugh and also think overall a great experience and will likely be the film of the year,0.9981,positive
570,elijahfcludlam,23-Jul-23,greta gerwigs barbie is a very interesting watch for a person like me im the type of guy this movie makes fun of in its twohour runtime i enjoy zack snyders justice league and the godfather and it certainly was a weird experience so yes barbie obviously isnt for me but im going to do my best to give my actual complaints about the film without making it sound like im butthurt about its jokes about the patriarchyfirst of all it gets far too preachy gerwig couldve kept the message of feminism in barbie but she couldve made it so much subtler than it is there are constant speeches about feminism and patriarchy i mean it gets crammed down your throat about every fifteen minutes the worst one was when a tween yes a literal twelve year old started preaching to barbie about consumerism fascism and capitalism like she was jaden smith talking about the political and economic state of the world it was insane and laughablesecond of all the messaging was really messed up and concerning the end of the movie felt like it was setting up for an actually sweet and heartwarming ending about equality but it was ruined when the barbies refused to give the kens any equality what the heck was the movie even for then the barbies went through literally no character development while the kens were actually funny and had the only development in the film also the way the barbies regained power in barbie land was baffling no joke they ended up making it look like they were cheating on their ken boyfriends to make the kens jealous of each other so they would fight there were absolutely no reprocussions the barbies had to face for doing this it was insane the movie basically taught little girls they should manipulate guys and make them jealous of each other to get what they wantthird of all will ferrell is wasted he is a big part of the first half of the movie but just kinda disappears in the second half its almost like gerwig forgot about his character but then said oh yeah its will ferrell we should probably give him a quick scene at the endthe only part i really enjoyed in this film was ryan gosling and all the other kens he is an absolute scene stealer no one clapped when the movie ended but people including me clapped when gosling finished his just ken song it was hilarious you can tell he was really having fun with it but all the other actors are just meh margot robbie looks like barbie yes but she doesnt really do anything else to stand outoverall barbie is just wasted potential what a shame,-0.6318,negative
571,julieshotmail,19-Nov-23,on the surface barbie looks fun and light but nothing could be further from the truth as this movie delves into some dark stuff thats why it works it presents an optimistic world that is all facade and if you peel away the layers you are reminded of the reality that things are not so great you could say that there is some level of menbashing here but that is all in service to how mattel has chosen to portray the ken doll as mere accessory to barbie so the movie doubles down on that and with the comedic talent of ryan gosling the movie gets to up the ante on the patriarchy satire i especially like the part when ken learns and practices to wave his finger no at a female assistant as for the casting of barbie margot robbie does a great job and truly fits the barbie look however in my mind the celebrity actress most physically resembling barbie has always been 1970s priscilla barnes from threes company and kudos to america ferreras funny nuanced portrayal of a mom having an existential crisis how about that monologue i love the satire part of this movie including the musical numbers and i see where they are going with the philosophical musings at the end but the sappiness becomes too much,0.9825,positive
572,bonniepage-40421,25-Sep-23,was very much looking forward to this movie its unfortunately terribly written they needed to figure out how to get all the ladies who dont like barbie on board so they went way over the top on the patriarchy at the expense of a real plot and good writing so many cringe moments the dancing kens barbie turning into real person the weird montage at the end that just didnt make sense too bad a good writer could have made this movie poignant clever funny and fun to watch instead the script just ponderedother reviewers pointed out the ripped off plot lines wizard of oz pinocchio velveteen rabbitthe one funny moment was gosling serenading barbie on the beach,0.7499,positive
573,pinacoladawv,25-Jul-23,this movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film i feel so seen and acknowledged i ended up crying as the credits rolled just because i felt like all the emotions i couldnt put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film this is a movie for everyone not just women it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for allunlike what some people might believe it is not anti men the whole point of kens story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm in the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person i dont understand in what world that message is anti men,-0.7285,negative
574,snperera,25-Jul-23,this movie has such a powerful message for women everywhere the set is amazing and the movie is so funny the writing is so clever and funny it made me feel so powerful and validated i really enjoyed it margot robbie is the perfect barbie and ryan gosling is the perfect ken i feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other barbies and kens were great i loved how there were different type of barbies in the movie being a woman is amazing and powerful and i hate how the world doesnt respect us or take us seriously there was some slow parts and jokes that didnt land for me but overall it was a great film,0.9831,positive
575,claszdsburrogato,29-Jul-23,barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023 many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction is it rough in a way yes but its deliberately lame theyre living puppets its obvious that this is lame the big complaint about the film is about the critics as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is but again its on purpose the criticism works very well the characters work the universe built here is incredible visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year a world all pink could be very strange but it turned out beautiful and very convincing margot robbie and ryan gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention on the other hand when they try to focus on other characters the quality is not the same some characters dont work particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life overall this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023,0.9785,positive
576,sophiaaven,26-Jul-23,it was sooo boring i could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters i love the cast but everything was soo unfunny i left the movie fealing like i learned nothing knew the movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is the barbie isnt so clevver as they think it is not even with the narrator i love greta but it dosent feel like her kinda like with wednesday not feeling like a tim burton thing but good job with the marketing it got me,0.954,positive

578,assiamdh,20-Jul-23,barbie had to carry the weight of everyones expectations just what the movie is talking about and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing perfect and everything in between the barbie topic no matter how superficial it may seem is not easy to grasp and hard to portray i think greta did an amazing job both margot and ryan played their part so well and speech from america made me cry with few tears all that was said is what all women feel billies song was cherry on top an 8 on surface since i thought to myself  why would they include such badly executed cgi and a 10 because um its barbie its barbie land it isnt real life and men should be glad that its not,0.7998,positive
579,rachealcheecham,26-Jul-23,this movie is an easy 1010 for me did not disappoint the casting the directing the plot the cinematography the sets the detail the acting the jokes it was all perfect i want to rewatch this movie already i watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it this movie made me laugh and cry it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way i have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever absolutely loved it and recommend,0.974,positive
580,beatlesfeelin,20-Jul-23,this movie was not what i expected at first but i loved it its been years since i watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic taika waititi said in an interview that hollywood particularly superhero movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life i feel like barbie could be the start of the undarkening of hollywood moviesas a woman with some trauma i love a good gritty womanrun movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a mans world sometimes though you just want some feelgood escapism that isnt forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message acrossive seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didnt make sense i feel like the way they executed it made sense for a barbie movie ive also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since kens arent equal in barbieland i loved that part especially in the same way that i dont like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message i think it also sucks when a movie takes too light of an approach because its scared to actually say something of course the kens arent equal in barbieland 1 ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was loose and 2 they are toys made by people they are a product lol of their makers so yes barbies are in charge but barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny or any form of bigotry states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservientthe audience in the theatre i was in seemed to feel the same way because when the narrator said well the kens have to start somewhere eventually theyll have as much rights as women have in the real world i swear everyone was laughing it really connected with the audience from what i saw so many clever points were made in a nonsensical barbie pink package and it was just perfect if you made it this far on my review youre going to have the best day ever today and tomorrow and the day after that and every day from now until forever 3,0.9959,positive
581,nastiadangelo,19-Aug-23,at the beginning there were little girls playing with dolls then came barbie the narrator said something about them pretending to be mothers to their dolls and then they the little girlstoddlers began to destroy their dolls i dont know about you but for me they imply that being a mother is somewhat something negative barbie is meant to inspire young girls to be whatever they want but why do they suddenly make it sound like wanting to be a mother is not something good they can strive to be so if a little girl wants to be a doctor or an astronaut thats fine it is but if she wants to be a mother it sounds as if it is frowned upon tsk tskalso i just cant understand why barbie and ken cant be equals why do we need one extreme or the other why do we need to have competely barbie or completely ken why cant it be barken land or kenrie land you may argue that at the end they somewhat reach equality between barbie and ken but in my opinion its not true barbies allow the kens to also be politicians but just at a lower ranking thats equality i also noticed that once barbie and ken first went into the real world ken saw that men can also have jobs from my point of view he was just very excited that he a man could also have a job but he just became an extremehonestly we have fought for equality and what is this teaching young children that you can only have one or the other but not a balance doesnt this remind you of 6070 years ago,-0.8008,negative

583,shariemichalec,12-Aug-23,i loved the opening sequence of the film and knew it was going to be a fun ride there on out and it was its not political yes it does talk about the hardships and stereotypes women face but its weird that anyone would be upset by that the set designs and camp were beyond entertaining and some of the scenes were so out of this world and hilarious the only reason i dont give it a full ten stars is that i do agree the ending fell a little flat for me in that i thought everyone in barbieland would be a little more equal but a small miss in an otherwise successful movie just go see it,0.9256,positive
584,elzarkazbek,11-Aug-23,film barbie was directed by greta gerwig it stars margot robbie as barbie and ryan gosling as ken the film is set in barbie land and real world it was filmed mostly in uk the story starts in our time in barbie land one day her feet are getting flat and she goes to weird barbie for adviceshe sends her to the real world ken hides in the car and goes with barbie there barbie founds out very upset thingsbut ken the exact opposite he brings his knowledge of patriarchy into barbie land and everything goes upside down in the end barbies and alan save barbie landi strongly recommend barbie it shows very important things has wonderful soundtracks i really loved this film,0.9099,positive
585,lunzie,22-Jul-23,im not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film but im certain that it is 100 a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys and girls dolls and all their accessoriesit doesnt paint the manufacturer in a good light making the ceo ferrell whom i heartily dislike anyway a buffoon along with all the men who occupy the boardroomit makes several wellplaced jabs at patriarchy and the real world but seems disjointed and searching for a meaningful plot i swear this is the last gerwig movie i will subject myself to because i find all of her films to date to be confusing and pointlessthe two leads robbie and gosling are perfect as is the rest of the cast especially kate mckinnon as the weird doll i refuse to write the names of the manufacturer or the dolls as my own little protest of blatant consumerism and marketing to children just once id like to watch a film directed toward children that doesnt include superheros blowing up things violence or product placement,-0.5092,negative

587,suvechhabose,1-Aug-23,"briefing 25  male  watched alone  not in any relationshipyo
greta grewig you joyous beauty you are an absolute gem  i ll try watching your movies  directedacted   all the cast members visuals musicals  themes  costume design choreography aside  let me just write about the story  the actual plot which progressesthere are some fairly thought subjective criticism too but they are minimum completely avoidablehere we see a doll living her best life  the opening invites you like a disney animated movie when disney was at their peak  like late 2010 or 11  the way men toys are shown is literally cringe worthy cries cuz thats desperate
but isnt it the whole point  every thing happens real smooth cha cha  then one day our lady falls in her existential draidthis existential draid has been a recurring theme in many classics from taxi driver to sopranos  two heavily male centric fictional stories   in many arthouse directors life long theme  from andrei tarkovsky to ingmar bergmanni was literally awestruck to find such a theme in this movie

but
everything afterwards is completely different than how typical existential draidy movies handles its story progressionbarbie decides to go to real world with ken  a ken which literally has no purpose in his life discovers adventure patriarchal society  gets deviated from his actual purpose here the humour elements are so heart touching that you ll feel your childhood fantasy in real life  from a male pov  this is nothing less than seeing transformersterminator avengers g i joe for the first time in live action  see its definitely understandable how girls are going to perceive this but make it even more enjoyable cause the humour element are so true  both barbie  ken getting sacked by cops the horror
the certain realisation hits barbie when she witnesses how or where the world is heading towards how ken discovers patrichy and leaves barbie in the real world to invent kendom in barbielandeverything at this point goes downhill until she meets a woman who make her see the way  not the granny  no 
the mother who is still a child within her heart america ferreraapparently more than barbie miss ferrera s character is made like an angel she helps barbie by solving every little bit of her issues  healthy advices  that with a great masterplan so simple yet so damn effective go watch it  m not writing every detailthe transformation 
we see barbie showing a lot of emotions while staying true to her emotions she experiences anger  sadness stubbornness yet she stays kind  she listens to her human domain  believes in her actions doubtful but always stays optimistic i think this world hasnt got women like this anymorewomen nowdays are getting cold  distant  are accepting masculine traits desperatly to fight male egos thus destroying their charisma personality  charm  see at the end  the journey comes to an end when a doll becomes human  that transformation comes through 1 confusion  2 anger issues when ken forces himself to join barbie while accessing the human world  3 denial barbie getting into mettel corp  4  pain barbie meeting that human girl who calls her a capitalistfascist  5 agreement planning to take over barbieland  6 still having complete understanding  empathy towards ken  saving ken when he breaks down  accepts kens defeat  not even once  not even for once barbie shows any type of pride  jealousy  resentmentthat makes her even more than a humanthe ending  thats why feels perfectshe getting transformed into a human through such an interesting journey feels poignant not forced  not sketchy  not masculine but entirely simple  vivid  full of feminine traitssexism works both ways  first barbie getting annoyed over kens desperation  later ken taking over the barbieland this movie just shows if both men  women listen to eachother  work for their inner souls they can let go of their respective personal bad blood  stupid patriarchal things which has been a stigmata of this giant world gone are the days when women only used to do household works  nursery cause there is no world war anymore
so now its time to completely bury that stupid mentalityken realises it later like all men do
 i think greta could have given him a better ending than making him wear a shirt which says  i am kenough  hilarious yet a bit lacky 1 for that and yes those childlike bollywood songs  1 for thatstill a clear w this just shows if a doll can make right choices  becomes a human

588,jgmnpxmj,23-Jul-23,this movie was so absurd and so fun i laughed so hard my face hurt i see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her hes kenough i think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie people dont super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases especially the messy parts it was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware im grateful this movie exists ps if ur mad that the barbies didnt give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does,0.9746,positive
589,yurixander10,1-Oct-23,i bought it on amazon one of the worst movies ive ever seen gosling and robbie give a good performance period but the theme of the movie and everything that surrounds it is what is this it shamelessly takes ideas from other films as a comedy its not funny at all i have been watching movies for so many years and i have seen everything but in recent years the movies are becoming more and more disappointing i was very happy that the movie attracted people to the cinema i also went to see oppenhaimer and it was wonderful but really this movie is completely forgettable i have never given a movie 1 star but this one deserves it it has nothing that can be redeemed i respect of course for those who liked it but this is what it seemed to me,0.9565,positive
590,anyanimeotoho,26-Jul-23,i dont know if ive ever seen anything quite like barbie which is rewarding if you ask me especially since i havent been this excited for any other release this year so what did i think of itfor starters i really admire the production of this movie gorgeous does not begin to describe the sets and its commendable how well they highlight the surrealism of barbieland i had seen a youtube video exploring barbies dreamhouse and already concluded in my mind that it was pretty great but seeing it in the context of the movie just made it better the costumes are great toofurthermore the acting is alright huge props to margot robbie the movie blends humour and angst with some other tonal elements which means that it demands more from the actors than you would assume at first the ensemble cast was obviously up to the task but something in their performances caught my attention i vaguely remember gerwig mentioning in an interview the issue of considering the technicalities of a typical barbies movements you can notice several points in the movie where the actors embrace the stiff and wooden movements of a doll but at other less noticeable or relevant moments theyre as flexible as a living entity whilst in barbieland i dont know how one would navigate a perfectly adequate balance between the two but my brain couldnt ignore this mild inconsistency whether you consider it important or not and i do the film did utilize this for comedic effect though and i thought that was a nice touchwhile there are more things i like than dislike about this movie i feel like the execution leaves something to be desired the first act of the movie is everything id hoped it would be campy funny and exceedingly pink i love that even the subsequent scenes in barbieland embrace this quirkiness irrespective of the stakes however the transition from barbie and cos everyday shenanigans to her journey of awareness and selfdiscovery felt a bit sudden while it aptly gives focus to the main conflict of the movie i feel like the heavy marketing of the movie had already given away too many glimpses of barbieland before i saw the film it took away the element of wonder and left the superficial part of me a little disappointed also the final twothirds of the movie is just shy of overstimulating i hate to say it but the reinforcement of women empowerment ideals isnt done tastefully and comes off harsher than it should and the sharp tonal change preceding it doesnt help the exploration of switched gender roles from barbieland to the real world was another clever idea whose execution lacked finesse this made ryan goslings ken briefly unlikeable to me he saved the performance with his undeniable charisma and sense of humour and even though i thought the ending was a nice surprise that scene with the billie eilish number is one of the most beautiful things ever i was sadly distracted by the nonsubtlety of the preceding events however funny or thoughtful they were perhaps i would appreciate it better with a second watchso yeah barbie is an experience tune in for the colourful heaps of fun and stay for the emotional and humanistic themes but beware of the untidy edges,0.9985,positive

the decor and colors were amazing the music was great the casting was incredible weird barbie allan the way barbie and ken were completely unaware of how the world worked when they first got there kens song the fragments of life that barbie saw at the endeven though many parts were good there are parts that just lacked sensethe movie tries to make sort of a statement of mother daughter relationships which kind of works but just not quite the daughter character doesnt contribute much to the story shes really just that one grumpy teenage character who turns out to have a heart after all but it just didnt make sense in the story next the entire corporation storyline didnt make sense at all in the beginning it was like fine they try to get barbie back to barbieland but then she goes back herself they follow her and from that point they contribute literally nothing to the story anymore i forgot they were there until they suddenly appeared out of the bushes it just lacked depth and logic and in my opinion it just wasnt necessary to have made the movie to what it wasnevertheless i enjoyed the movie a lot but some plot points just werent what i expected them to be still i would recommend this movie to a friend",0.992,positive

594,MyMovieTVRomance,23-Sep-23,seen this as a birthday present with my mom and sister my birthday was on the 21st but i ended up seeing the barbie movie on the 22nd  joan jetts birthday wearing my joan jett necklace that i had received as a birthday gift along with my joan jett slash barbie inspired outfit so this will go down in history as a very special movie outing for me i felt like i was going to the actual premiereweird barbie was my fave kate mckinnon is so attractive and even though they say that she was based on david bowie i saw a lot of phyllis diller in her yay for weird barbie my other favorite character was the barbie creator played by rhea perlmanwanted to slap the kid for most of the film for being so rude to her mother and just so grumpy in general and i felt bad for ken i expected that he was going to be an actual villain but he wasnt based on the reviews i read and the criticisms that people had of this movie i was expecting a really bad guy but he was just a hurt guy ken just wanted as much love as barbie had and isnt that understandable i really felt for him and i like that i felt for him because i would rather that than to hate him the way a lot of the reviewers seem toi adored the musical numbers i adored the colors and this movie was a lot more emotional than i expected it actually made me start to cry i was surprisedi didnt like that barbie kept pushing ken away though saying that she wasnt in love with him thats just completely against everything that the barbie can relationship stands for  the fact is hes her boyfriend and eventually they do get married i mean look at any barbie coloring book from the 90s and before this whole barbie doesnt need ken thats just some new made up thing shes always loved ken and hes always loved her  thats one of the reasons why they are considered an ideal couple so i didnt like that part nor did i like the part of the little girls basically beating up their baby dolls i thought that was so crass and sad a sight the idea that they were trying to convey could have been conveyed in a much nicer manner but overall a very good movie well done well doneoh and i almost forgot helen mirren as the narrator how wonderful a choice,0.9846,positive

598,shpckbn,23-Jul-23,it truly surprises me how greta gerwig revolutionizes the film industry with a movie thats seemingly so simple and childlike and turning it into a life lesson and still keeping the fun in it it has so many fun elements in it but still gives off its message so clearly how well it was filmed and directed was truly astounding to see how it was not only visually beautiful and aesthetically pleasing but also the writing and the acting every part of this movie was well thought out and it shows my only critique is that the pace at the ending was a bit too fast and random but it ultimately makes sense in the movie so its excusable,0.9756,positive
599,overconsumer450,20-Aug-23,i am shocked at how polarizing this movie has been in terms of feedback i say this as someone who was not anxiously anticipating its release nor as someone who was triggered by its growing popularity i went into this with neutrality i knew this would have more powerful messaging than it seemed as i am a fan of gerwigs previous works but i knew if it did not that the film probably would leave me unfulfilled for that reason i was most bored during the first section of the film that was too lighthearted childlike for my taste but i was excited to get into the deeper plot points this being said i recognize the film was marketed ingeniously to produce buzz however it was ineffective in describing what the movie was really about i can totally see why parents may have thought this was appropriate for children despite the pg13 rating but this absolutely was not made for kids this was a campy commentary on the patriarchy in america and the modern feminist movement these plot points were actually my biggest criticisms of it from my perspective this displayed an accurate depiction modern feminism which often neglects to acknowledge its roots grown by in black feminists and the patriarchies disproportionate effects on low income women especially those of color this movie promoted a feminist message that feels decades behind and in such an obvious way that i am shocked that this explored new ideas or dramatically moved anyone in the audience it was a blunt reminder of how behind we are but not even through the messaging in the film but rather how viewers are reacting the only feminist commentary beneath surface level that i wouldve been more excited to explore were made via side comments from various side characters like the socialistanarchist daughter who by the way i found upset to have seen painted as mean and then only kind after conforming to barbies ideas of feminism but i digress with all that being said it had a fantastic soundtrack made me laugh quite a few times and ryan goslings acting was superb ironically although the whole cast did well with the script they were given justice for michael ceras character i wouldve loved to see his cravings to break away from societal norms be further explored the movie was fun campy in a more obvious way than i usually like but thats the mainstream hollywood box office industry for you my overall take is this wasnt made for a person like me who craves exploring new ideas or highlighting important calls to action as they relate to feminism rather than this rehashing this surface level antipatriarchy message i am glad that this is making people converse in what im understanding are new ideas to many i am just shocked that they are in fact new,0.9937,positive

624,phoenixgardenscc,26-Sep-23,i really liked the movie without going into too much detail i was surprised when i realized the movie was made more for us who played with the barbies way back in the day you think its directed at the younger generations but it actually fits since even my own daughter never wanted nor played with a barbie i myself had the entire entourageand still have them almost 40 years later so it was much more endearing and relatable i liked the underlying themes which added depth and perspective that i didnt expect at all i think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics  it gives people a chance to think feel and relate to it without having the movie become too heavy or being too much people that thought it was confusing probably didnt understand that the movie intended to keep it lighthearted for this very reason i recommend seeing it especially if you have a barbie still tucked away on your closet too,0.9675,positive

this movie is like a firework starts bright and promising but ends up fading into the darknessso basically barbie selfishly sets out to help the girl who is playing her in order to restore her perfection  wich turns out to be an adult woman but in the end the girl ends up saving barbie and barbieland with little to no resolution to her own problems  but through all this barbie realises she doesn want to go back to being perfect for everyone to project their ideals on her but just live as a regular human cute right yeah they only problem is nothing was convincing the adventures of our characters were not enough to transform them yet they did change the only well developed character was ken not only his character arc was amazing compared to the others it also was a fine commentary of how patriarchy damages young men so of it was called ken then i would have rated it like 7 but its a barbie movie and unfortunately our female lead had the laziest character arc and the most deus ex machina development everironically she was through it all really sweet and likeable maybe a meta commentary of what women are appreciated for sweet and likeable is enough but anything more is too much and also she only wants to be seen as human if so i congratulate the movie but i dont think it was clear enough to give it credit formaybe thats what you get when you are sponsored by whom you are supposed to critique lol

631,maragaik,23-Jul-23,this is the first movie ive ever watched that i cannot stop thinking about the way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane margot robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and i have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much the one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just dont understand the point of the movie at least what i think is the point is to show how women are still being put underneath men but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do they wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of kens they should be an allan,0.176,positive
632,dawn-barnsdale,23-Jul-23,i didnt have a lot of big expectations for this movie so imagine how happy and surprised i was about how much i enjoyed it its silly and fun and then boom existentialism while i wouldnt recommend this movie for under 10 theres a lot of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles imo the soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect margot robbie is a delight as is ryan gosling the entire cast is wonderful issa rae never disappoints and her role as president barbie a truly fun summer movie,0.9832,positive
633,verasofiazeta,29-Jul-23,this movie is amazing it perfectly describes womanhood in a way few movies that ive seen has it shows how different women and men are treated and also the feeling of growing up as a woman i started to miss all my childhood barbies that we gave to my little cousin now its also completely hilarious and the cast is absolutely perfect almost no one else could play barbie and ken as good as margot robbie and ryan gosling has even though its technically about barbies dosent mean that its aimed for children its perfect for women of all ages and for men to learn more about what its like to simply grow up and simply exist as a woman,0.9774,positive
634,skiluce,23-Jul-23,this movie is set for what women experience its a movie for the men who say what if the roles were reversed you can call this a feminist or political movie but if equality is that to you that says enough this movie should be a reflection of men and women its not a kids movie they will not understand it but more for those who grew up watching it and playing with dolls as she was the first girl toy that went outside the mother role she is a role model to many young girls who are now women and a lesson to men who will never understand you can call me a feminist by truly women has it hard men hate women women hate women,-0.7684,negative
635,jbermerubio,26-Jul-23,it is a film of absurd humour which is funny in many moments that criticises political models fragile masculinity and society both past and presentthe approach is to turn current society on its head and make barbieland a world dominated by women where they form the elite of society and the kens are simply their boyfriends irrelevant unemployed kept objects basically what women are in the macho societywhen barbie and ken arrive in the real world barbie realises that the world is upside down that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men and ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in barbieland so far the script and the critics are being perfectafter a lot of criticism of the heteromale behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour the critical moment arrives the message of the film the barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly dont want to go back to the previous model where they ruled i say supposedly because they do go back to that model one ken asks the president of barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the presidents answer is yes but from below and little by littlein the end the barbies after discovering the reality of the real world adopt the same model they do not accept the kens as equals no let them gradually integrate just as it has happened with women who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women it was the perfect time to talk about equality to think about a new model about evolution and there is no solution the barbies continue with the model of todays society so the film doesnt contribute anything what is the wonderful message they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against if you make a social and political criticism you have to propose your own solution in barbie there is no solution the solution is the current systemtherefore it is overrated and on top of not showing the reality of the barbie world they show barbies of all races and sizes do they sell xxl barbies or barbies and ken of all races they show a diversity that the barbie universe has never had,0.7526,positive
636,parkercblair,23-Jul-23,the duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here this movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others this movie does center women but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie washilarious intelligent beautiful poignant tasteful this movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman i will be watching more greta movies from now on if not all of them i cried,0.8598,positive

638,avagodoy,23-Jul-23,barbie was by far one of the best movies ive watched in 2023 from the acting to the costumes it was all just so amazing i have no words to express how i feel after watching barbie it had to much emotion built into it margot robbie had such a speechless performance greta grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning it gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person i enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster i hope we can see a sequel to barbie the movie deserves all the love go watch it now,0.9787,positive
639,benjhoy,7-Aug-23,i was really excited to see barbie but sadly the film came up short for meon the positive side of things the film has plenty of creativity and the idea of recreating the dolls actual world was a cool one no stairs no liquid in cups feet permanently on tip toes etc margot robbie was excellent as always cudos to mattel for their willingness to sign off on a film that depicts their company in such a negative light that isnt something you commonly seeon the negative side of things the plot felt a bit like a rehash of the dozen or so other films ive seen that feature a two worlds colliding theme a lot of the silly ideas i was expecting to find funny the beach off fell flat for me and seemed to rely more on just saying the same joke over and over rather than using it in a creative waythe films messages about the crushing weight of societys expectations on women and the uneven distribution of powerrespect felt hamstrung by the lack of depth in the characters ken gosling comes off as an idiot for the entire film and the ceo of mattel feels more like a cartoon villain than a real person in the end the barbies dont aim to create a more just society but are content instead to simply replicate problematic structures in the opposite direction the film ends with little to no character development no one seems to have learned anything by the end of the film the patriarchy which this film centers around is reduced in places to drinking brewskies horses and brainwashing those kind of reductions make it hard to appreciate the social message that the film portrays and sells the audiences intelligence shortpart of the problem for me i think is i am unsure of who the target audience for this film is meant to be if this is meant for children the simplistic characters and over the top messaging might make sense but the themes and jokes feel a bit dark and too adult for them if this is meant for adults the characters lack the nuance that gerwig was able to show in some of her other work ladybirdin the end there are a few fun moments in this film but the films heavy handed messaging mixed with the lack of depthnuance in characters means it doesnt hit nearly as hard as it probably should have,-0.6105,negative
640,Trsines0,23-Jul-23,"it was a really fun and rewatchable movie it had some really relevant messages  the only negative is that it felt the movie couldnt decide how it was going to deliver those messages it almost felt like 2 directors were on set 1 that wanted a whimsical movie that didnt take itself seriously and one that wanted the movie to be social commentary and they thumb wrestled at the beginning of each scene to determine who directed iti feel like the ceomattel goons were unnecessary to the movie and barbies decision at the end was out of the blue and seemed to wrap up too quickly
overall though a really creative film that i will buy on digital to watch repeatedlymargot and ryan were brilliant along with simu liu being a standout when he was on screen",0.9086,positive
641,vladamisa,26-Jul-23,this movie is not for kids despite the trailers i saw not showing it may not be for kids i only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world the sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy the sub plot should have been the main plot the set design was great the world looked beautiful the story just sucked not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and i thought they leaned way to hard into this if they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least i grew up playing with barbies and i am sorry but my barbies always loved their kens for barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion there was not enough barbieland and too much stupidity,0.5789,positive

643,androkyrie_,22-Jul-23,barbie directed by greta gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 from the first photos on set to the huge marketing barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor it delivers amazing performances from the whole cast robbie and gosling with unmatched chemistry ferreras monologue and everybody elsethe message is clear how it is to be a woman in this reality a mother a daughter feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter greta managed to tell us how impactful barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to selfconscious girlsshe exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy at first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but youll understand that the same barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes this judgment is already solved in the message of the movie greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moralits camp its fun and its popthe script is smart and well written it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation barbie and ruth handler and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by gloria ferrera theres a handful of cinema references from kubricks 2001 space odyssey to the wizard of oz there are jokes on movies that arent to be taken to seriously youll find them funnyjokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that youll absolutely agree withits not only a feminist message but barbie expands its themes to kens character the difficulty to found his own identity to be someone outside of his shadow his barbiethis film is demential and intelligent an adaptation of the loveable doll you can have fun with it but also write a whole essay about its moral and heart,0.9889,positive
644,alisonacostachinchilla,26-Jul-23,the heart of the director and screenwriters was in the right place in wanting to include current issues and acknowledge how diverse and troubled our society is however it lacked cohesion todays world is certainly patriarchal but the films story was vague and filled with too many topics poorly developed and platitudes the role of some of the actors such as will ferrell seemed meaningless to me the film covered important themes but wanted to cover too much and yet covered nothingthe animation cinematography and effects are wonderful but the story falls shorti do not recommend it,0.3474,positive

653,emeryb-78668,8-Sep-23,this movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion literally i dont care if you dont like barbies or pink because this movie is so much more than that it makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is the movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about barbie dolls and the development barbie the movie was very mature in my opinion and isnt necessarily a kids movie even though its called barbie a doll it didnt have too much k18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a childoverall absolutely beautiful movie and really touching its not only about toys its about life go watch it,0.4234,positive

that was a bit evil im sure a lot of kids went to see this film and teens the cinema i was in was sure packed but that wasnt a good message to save barbieland we must lie and cheat on our boyfriends not sure a lot of parents would like that message either then the film wraps up wonderfully about barbie becoming human and herself instead of playing the role of barbie which was wonderful but are we supposed to just pretend and forget the message of this film just five minutes ago is to cheat on your boyrfriends and lie to them once youve gained their trust and made them happy hmm ryan gosling however was amazing to witness totally amazing just like he was in any other gosling film drive and blade runner being my favsi will rewatch this because the comedy is very much on point but ill fast forward a lot of the extremist feminist speeches as they leave a questionable aftertaste when examined i cannot give this film a 10 even though you can tell the production budget is amazing as were the acting go and see it if you have the itch but its not for everyone",0.9894,positive
669,artbyfalcon,25-Jul-23,honestly this is the best movie ive ever seen the roles are so perfectly played and everyone did such a good job on this movie i love it so much came with a bunch of friends my mom their moms and my little sister everyone said that they lived the movie the ending made me cry but in such a good way like how barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time seeing a movie that doesnt have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing and honestly if youre mad at this movie you might be part of the problem seeing ruth appear and give barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience i loved it so much i cant even explain seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshingwhen the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into itand can we talk about how well will ferrell played his role and dont even get me started on margots acting literally amazing she played her role so wellthis movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more at the end when barbie said her name barbara was so amazing because she was originally named after ruths daughter i loved that so muchand honestly i think that everybody needs to see this movie no matter what your standpoint on life is everyone needs to see this movieand seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing i could go on and on about how good this movie made me feel but i would be here all dayit was such a good movie and i would definitely watch it again such a good watch,0.9986,positive
670,valarafik,21-Jul-23,i loved the barbie movie it was very empowering and encouraging to young girls then ending is unexpected and kind of sad but the movie did not disappoint i was worried it wasnt gonna live up to the expectations but it exceed the expectations i want to watch it again and again i also love the marketing for this movie it deserves a higher rating i hope theres a part 2 going into more detail so we get even more context about the choices and decisions or a continuation of the ending i also loved how they put the original barbie creator and inspiration for barbie that was a nice touch but it needed nicki minaj,0.9853,positive
671,joaoterry,22-Jul-23,so much garbage i dont get this movie at all let me explain myself this is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this what kind of audience was this movie made for doesnt look like it was made for kids nor adults just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are who thought this would be a good idea same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately margo robbie as barbie some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia like mulan the lion king or scooby doo to name a few this one failed doing so,-0.4784,negative
672,sarahbollmann,20-Jul-23,the most fun ive had at the cinema in a long time the jokes are meta and hilarious the performances all through spectacular this was like a fever dream and i cant wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again i did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears a movie everyone should go and watch and how beautiful that billie eilish song was we will definitely hear it live next year at the academy awards where i hope greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this already iconic film production design script directing acting especially ryan bodied that role and best original song i would want to see awarded,0.9913,positive
673,jenniferschaefer-25160,9-Aug-23,i had to watch this movie twice the first time we missed the first 5 minutes and the whole movie was confusing and i left feeling bewildered and disappointed then i read a review by michael knowles and i realized i missed something very crucial at the start my teenaged daughter and i went back and we watch it from the beginning this is a very clever movie the layers of cleverness become very apparent when you look beyond the surface it is a story of current society and the ills that plague usi think at first everyone is concerned about the audience for the movie it is definitely not meant for younger kids but it is rated pg13 id say the innuendo is a bit much for 13 but it may just go right over their heads ultimately i think this movie has been very misjudged by a lot of critics it is way deeper than barbie maybe should be but it is great for adults who dont like what they see in our current state of existence,0.437,positive
674,obeidallahmohmmed,16-Oct-23,from where to even begin the movie is absolutely immaculate the acting is beyond reasonable i would say that perhaps this gretas most loved film but that would be an extreme allegation considering the public opinion the movie roars out of the gate with an inventiveness and energy which perhaps the audience was not all set for the film spreads its politics explicitly using rudimentary ideas about the performance of gender gender inequality and consumerism to fuel the plot and inform its comic beats you would even forget that the movie is actually and in essence about a doll because the plot is quite indulging what i admired most is helen mirren performing the narration not to forget that the casting was also impressive,0.9299,positive
675,qnzmnjkq,26-Jul-23,its a good movie walking out of it i knew people wouldnt like it considering we rarely have a womens actual point of view in cinema its actually quite funny seeing peoples reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isnt truein my viewing people were clapping laughing and crying its touching and im sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not this movie isnt about a perfect dollthat being said if you dont like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film not bad ones just some are abit longer than id likeoverall id watch again and ive never actually owned a barbie ,0.4323,positive
676,oliviamiknis,11-Aug-23,everything about this movie was incredible the casting was on point the sets are eye catching the soundtrack is delectable i can not express how much this movie has impacted my life after seeing it not once not twice but three times it gets better and better every time this movie is so hilarious while also being profound and thoughtprovoking i left the theater crying all 3 times each time shedding more tears than the last watching it with my mother was truly a special experience as i got to see how the themes of the movies impacted her as well i think about this quote at least once a day mothers stand still so their daughters can look back and see how far theyve come i would recommend the barbie movie to anyone and everyone,0.9692,positive
677,skennedy-36258,5-Aug-23,interesting look at barbies world but maybe not enough pink  loved the musical numbers and the star studded cast who did not falter on their delivery the unfortunate truth of the real worlds patriarchal society is laid out perfectly sound track was awesome especially lizzo have to say fun to see all the pink outfits rolling into the cinemas not many icons can have this effect sex and the city excluded doesnt take itself too seriously and deffinetly falls into the comedy genre comfortably will ferrell is a great addition although i word have liked to have seen more of him in the end it is barbies world,0.9791,positive
678,williamjosecastillo,22-Jul-23,i wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly maybe its meant for preteens i cant believe margo and ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles ive also noticed that goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger he is 43 yrars old thiwcis not the type of role for him hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality barbie movie i mean thats just unnecessary i cant believe some people here thought it was entertaining dont waste your hard earned money on this one avoid at all costs,0.2961,positive
679,roxydzey,19-Sep-23,before watching it i thought this movie going to be just a pop corn movie with beautiful cinematography and colors and with good actors doing their job as always really well but when i started watching ive got the different idea of this movie i was expecting more of a wolf among us video game style type of thing while watching this move i expected more and more from it but ive got dissapointed in the end that it ended in cliche no plotwist and nothing original way would have been amazing if they made exactly same idea like that wolf among us game imagine barbies and kens living in our world but in a dark our worlds natural way if film makers made it this way and nailed it i would have gave this 1010 now im giving 810 which is a decent score for this movie because of its cringe worthy last 30 minutes of the ending or so loved the joke in the very end and loved couple of matrix easter eggs,0.9894,positive

681,GDinero_90,25-Sep-23,barbie the movie left me disappointed and unimpressed the storyline felt overly simplistic lacking depth and originality the dialogue was clichd often predictable and failed to engage the audience the characters seemed onedimensional and their development was superficial at best the animation touted as a highlight fell short of expectations lacking the polish and detail one would anticipate from a major production overall it failed to capture the attention of both children and adults making it a forgettable viewing experience even the scene with america ferrera felt so forced and cliche and it fed on superficial emotions,-0.8001,negative
682,harry-rankin325,30-Jul-23,i have never seen a barbie movie my wife loves them and so i have heard some of the songs but i have never actually watched one having seen some videos and commercials and things i had a vague sense of what it was aboutmy wife and i went to go see this movie together i was there more to support her than out of interest i expected some silly fun movie something like the lego movie i was wrongthe movie initially piqued my interest with its interesting depiction of cartoon behavior in live action if youve seen the movie you know what i mean interesting for sure but not groundbreaking it slowly progressed and eventually had my full attention it was something of a spiritual experience for me the perfect humor drew me in and the pure emotion portrayed at the end of the movie left me very touched and contemplative it is an original masterpiece of a movie sure to make you feel somethingto sum it up i came into the theater with low expectations and i came out moved and impacted in a way that i have rarely felt,0.9941,positive
683,matthewreinink,12-Nov-23,this movie is not completely worthless like i was expecting it to be when i saw the trailer there are some good comedic bits in this movie and the acting is fairly good there is also a lot more substance to this film than i was expecting this movie really is geared towards adults rather than kidsi appreciate the movie touching on some interesting topics like the impact that barbie has had on body image her impact on gender roles and the unhealthy obsession with material items it is certainly a bold move by the director one that could have been executed better at times the delivery of the messaging feels too clunky including a shakespearean monologue from america ferrera this is also a movie that doesnt seem to want to end the final 15 minutes drag with an inefficient wrap up sequence,0.9401,positive
684,emmysbubble,24-Jul-23,so good the emotions the reality and how it came together as a live action barbie film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children i am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding there was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant my favourite has to be the weird barbie because i definitely relate to her more i recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh its just a kids film but once youve watched it its not what you expect and im itchy to watch it again,0.9434,positive
685,ratthink,2-Aug-23,expertly written perfectly plastic visually with a strong thematic mix of the matrix and the wizard of oz but it very much made me think of late career comedy specials from george carlin not as fun as expected but there are zero flaws in the logic of the messageso many little nuances that pull you into the well crafted universe bit by bit the added touch of there being multiple barbies and kens that are not differentiated by name was genius it may make it somewhat difficult to discuss the slight differences between the characters but so whati just hope they dont make a sequel i cant imagine how they could do that without it being a cheap cash grab and that would be a shame for a movie with this kind of intellect,0.7871,positive
686,aipsun,26-Aug-23,as one of the most anticipated films of the year barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations especially cinephiles  and make it the most daring film of the year director greta gerwig supported by screenwriter noah baumbach doesnt just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon colorful set designs stunning costumes and makeup great music they all sing the history of the barbie doll but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism patriarchy feminism diversity inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense as a film barbie delivers it all fun excitement and seriousness the casting of margot robbie and ryan gosling as barbie and ken is also the right choice barbie reminds us again that summer box office hits can be really fun and good,0.9791,positive
687,verolisa-96256,1-Aug-23,truthfully after seeing this film once i did not realize just how many gems there are in it everything in the movie is representative of something else it is more than just literal for eg barbie was not into ken as we are accustomed to because her owner did not have a ken doll the adding on of the character ruth gave so much life to this movie this one was definitely dedicated to women as a girl if you havent seen it i would recommend you go as soon as you can it is especially empowering to young girls because it truly shows the essence of a woman the trailer was not enough to capture the beauty of this movie it was definitely more than what i expected i completely understand why anyone would think that the men were portrayed as dumb obviously in the real world men arent as bad as the movie makes it seem but i think what was meant to come from this movie was a deeper message and this may have been necessary to really capture what the movie was trying to portray for all women it was needed to emphasize the movie so to speak,0.8599,positive
688,dararamos,22-Aug-23,originally when i went into the cinema my expectations were quite low however i was pleasantly surprised everything from the set the dances the music the costumes and the actors were phenomenal credit to ryan gosling he fulfilled his role as ken so well and his interactions with margot robbie were top notch i loved the amount of secret cameos that went into when making this movie this piece of media will go down in history as it has been so well done and the messages in it were very much prevalent i couldnt be happier i adore this movie and i cannot wait to watch it again at home,0.9585,positive

697,elizaraek,23-Jul-23,i think the significance of barbie wasnt the fact that it was a fun joyous all around well movie i felt everything from the point being that women to this day hold such little power you cant want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy you need to show off but not too much nothing youll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power but along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that its okay you can be emotional and logical at the same time its okay to not know if what youre doing is right i wont ever know if i was made to do what i want to do am i supposed to be an astronaut is that what my purpose is i feel lazy when i see that everyone is out having amazing times and im stuck in the same continuous loop literally everything that can make me me isnt actually me at all and the thought scares me in our world we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it and this movie is the most beautiful way to showcase all of the world and what women truly do go through,0.9745,positive

700,kmkrhia,31-Jul-23,as most are saying the casting was great the costumes were awesome barbie land set design was on point the story could have been so much better it started out fine but dragged in the middle it became preachy we know we live it everyday mention patriarchy and move on i thought it would have been nice to show both sides working together equally in the end it might not have been realistic but we would have left the theater with a smile i was not alone leaving the theater thinking what was that all about i did not see too many children in the theater which was good because it would have been way over their head,0.9595,positive

702,daniju,23-Jul-23,i had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by mumblecore maestro gerwig who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water elf meeta enchanted vibeinstead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design watching empowered millionaire actors writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining and i found it sad later to see all the excited littlegirls waiting to see the next show to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their dads sitting next to them in the screen,0.7997,positive
703,voakchrl,27-Jul-23,watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second watch definitely not the allenlightening and godsaving movie to the feminist movement but it does touch on a lot of issues in such a beautiful greta gerwigesque waythe barbiegloria gloriasasha and barbieruth interactions are so impactful for mothers and daughters teared up a few times and would have definitely full on cried if i was home alone while watching the movieryan gosling was so good at playing ken and making the audience laugh at him laugh with him feel bad for him get mad at him and understand himmargot robbie is just overall the perfect barbie,0.9702,positive
704,courthatesjunk,21-Jul-23,for a movie about a line of plastic dolls it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while ive dont think that ive walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and im already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theatersfrom the huge amount of artists work that went into making intricate sets that had the feeling of big broadway ensemble stage pieces to the soundtrack i cant say enough good things about this movie go see it take your teenagers or your mom but greta gerwig went and made something really special,0.7562,positive
705,AndyLianB,28-Jul-23,i went in the cinema optimistic as the trailer looks really good comedy entertaining but the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film the rest i never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time the film didnt make any sense what so ever besides from the first 30 minutes  the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophei have to praise margot robbie for her performance despite the deplorable storyline her acting was outstanding on the other hand ryan goslings actingperformance was cheap cheesy  overall cringeworthy a massive shout out to kate mckinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny i love her originalityoverall not for me as the storyline is atrociously written  didnt make sense,0.9918,positive
706,WhereDoWeGoFromHere,4-Aug-23,i should be the target audience i am a woman in her thirties that grew up playing with barbie dolls malibu barbie stacy skipper ken and the likesbut this movie failed on so many accounts i cannot for the life of me understand what the message of this movie iswas what am i take away from thiskens have more fun no wait kens have all the fun they can be as stupid as they want and still get really cool songs to sing matchbox 20 is one of my alltime favourite bands  love me some rob thomas they get to take over in 48 hours not hard at all because barbies actually want to be submissive and they have an actual story arc although kinda leaning into evil territory that this movie could have had the title ken  and barbies do what barbies are what meant to be pretty and thats it that is indeed what breaks this barbies camels neck the fact that she isnt pretty anymore and then we get this superficial women are so torn monolog in the middle of the movie that missed all the beats it was meant to hit i am a woman was i meant to sympathise it was a meaningless chain of words strung together to form more meaninglessness couldnt have perfect barbie pulled herself up by her bootstraps no she needs the mom with her superficial observationsthe barbie i grew up with was humble she wouldnt have had this attitude of i know i am perfect although she of course was i was missing that toobut most of all and i cannot emphasise how important that is i hate that barbie doesnt get to have any fun in this movie i hate that she doesnt tell ken in the end that she cant be the one responsible for his happiness that he has to take responsibility for his own happiness i hate that ken is concerned with not having genitals in front of those real world workers it shouldnt matter to him at this point in the movie later on okay but even a genitalless ken seems to be afraid of others thinking he has nothing in his pantsthis is a minor quibble but the ladies in the beginning that i want to call sturdier than any barbie ive ever seen body wise were there ever such barbies i get that the movie wants to be inclusive but i never got to play with overweight barbie and i would have liked an explanation for their existence in barbieland just one line would have sufficedtheres so much about this movie that doesnt sit well with me but most of all  even on boring days my barbies had way more fun than this stereotypical barbie she was having real adventures and that is something sorely missing from this movie which means i as the viewer had no real fun watching it instead i was trying to wrap my head around how nonesensical most of it felt to melike my header says  squandered potential,-0.2251,negative
707,willster-83146,22-Oct-23,watched barbie tonight with the missus and we loved it such a wonderful message and deep existential concepts that i was not expecting from a toy movie its up there with the first lego movie in heart but almost feels like a maturer continuation of it and thats not even getting into the visual aspects of it from practical effects to the acting it was all top notch visually engaging and incredibly entertaining to say i had tears at the end of it sounds embarrassing but when the message the visuals and that score hit at the climax the rush of feelings i got the memories it unlocked down to the thoughts if everything my wifes gone through and will go through it was cathartic and heart wrenching all at the same time i have so much to say about this movie but i just want to bask in it for a while fantastic movie i cannot praise it enough,0.9696,positive
708,vanwierreinder,24-Jul-23,i liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it i did think the feminism was a little too on the nose sometimes but its difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences overall it was a job well done the set was beautiful and everything expected from a barbie movie simu liu and ryan gosling were showstealers as rivalling kens and margot robbie was perfectly cast i was also really surprised that the slogan a movie for people who love barbie and people who hate barbie caught the essence they didnt shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the barbie dolls and mattel as a company,0.9657,positive

710,mkmaca,20-Jul-23,barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film it offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie i was worried there would be much too many musical scenes but after watching it i believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places the whole scene nearing the end of the film i wont spoil anyhting dont worry was just so well done i loved that the play on womenmale dynamics was very lighthearted but just serious enough there is apsolutely no menbashingthe kens were put in the womens places from the real world and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is too feminist and is menbashing are failing to see their hypocrisy,0.9695,positive
711,philipvalchev,24-Jul-23,for me this is the most pointless movie ive ever watched i really dont understand where all this hype came from my expectations were not that high considering the type of movie but sill i waa not prepared for this  which is the reason why i leave my first review in imdbfor me this movie is just milking the barbie brand great cast though the sets the costumes the colours  these was perfect and the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching so should you watch ithaha no dont waste your time and money spend some time with your friends instead and buy them a drink ,0.9515,positive
712,The_Lyllee_Evans,18-Sep-23,i watched this movie in the theater 9 weeks after its release when the crowd of the barbenheimer made its exit safely it was time for me to move in not dressed in pink none of the 6 of us in the audience was and watch it away from the hypeand boy was i grateful i didbecause the herds of my mid thirties millennial peers that saw it before me were hyped about the nostalgia of being a girl again they also singlemindedly agreed that this movie is such a feel good movieand it is if you ignore the sharp societal commentary the selfcriticism on mass consumerism and capitalist dogma our society is based upon the sexes are seeking validation from and at the end of the day our relationship with ourselves and anyone around us is defined sure womanhood and manhood are not deeply portrayed in this pink firework after all one of kens first lines is that pining whisper of i love you too whilst she waltzes off in her matriarchal utopia after all  thanks to barbie all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solvedglorias monologue can easily go above your head if the pretty dresses and perfect hairdos are flashing in front of your eyes its understandable not wanting to listen to her sum of womans existence in a couple of minutes to the point that it felt like a knife to the gut and i was trying to control my sobsi am sorry this is not a feel good movie greta gerwig is holding up a mirror to all of us and points the finger of accountability this movie will age as a fine wine and it will be as timeless as barbies last line that defines the origins of us all,0.9758,positive
713,manuupetraassi,23-Jul-23,the plot is interesting enough to make you feel interested and intrigued even if youre not a barbie fan or just not a fan of cliches it has a beautiful meaning behind it and its the best movie for you to watch if youre a woman  this movie is great  i usually dont watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me  the marketing crew did an insanely perfect job  the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie the whole thing is genius the performances  specially ryan and margot  are outstanding and genuinely really good  the direction is great and the whole soundtrack is fantastic final consideration  go watch barbie  its worth it,0.9908,positive
714,tyqdkzvt,27-Aug-23,i think barbie is one of the most powerful movies to impact the world portraying men as the women in todays society and american culture is brilliant to me its movies like this that will teach the young how unfair the world is and thats okay the sooner we can help bring equality to the country like it was made for the sooner we can learn to help each other i will say its a shame greta wasnt able to do things her way because i feel like it was very apparent how much the story changed midway but either way it was a sweet message to every girl and their mothers an acknowledgement to the struggles women face that men have little to no idea about i really loved this movie and all the little allegories they used,0.917,positive
715,ksl93090,23-Jul-23,if it matters for an age perspective im 32 i really wanted to like this movie but it was disappointing the actors did a good job with what they were given and the barbieland costumes and set design were great but it was a poor storyline being a comedy there were only about 3 moments that i found funny i noticed the audience in the theater didnt laugh much either i think the advertising for this was better than the actual film the media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews but its definitely not worth the hype i know i wont ever watch this movie again,0.9117,positive
716,ericliaw,20-Jul-23,film story line is great you can totally understand what does director and writer they create a unbelivable filmif you like barbie you must watch but if you hate barbie you must barely go to watch thisim never expect how can casting can be so professional to let margot robbie and ryan gosling being barbie  ken im barely enjoy their acting fun and enjoy their characther in this film like the acting coach saidmake believemoral of the stories in the critical world we are living in a terrible world we always hope we had an wonderful life but if we really live in a freedom and peaceful world we may be not having a perfect life in ourself go enjoy your life like a barbie,0.9863,positive
717,jcamilotm,17-Aug-23,the film not only talks about the role of women in society but also about how men are affected by the behavior and criticism of this repressed society full of hatred and misunderstanding both genders in real life suffer discrimination and minimization in labor fields parental roles etc and this is something the movie makes mention of but one has to be a bit more picky and watch the movie several times to understand the real message of the movie about the humor its okay but at times it can feel a bit fierce out of place not to call it forcedabout its music the film has several pieces but theyre not able to shine as well as the movie itself and just a few like what was i made for or dance the night away are remembered out of all the film has to offer,-0.9331,negative
718,hannahgawne,30-Jul-23,as someone who has been a fan of barbie since i was a little girl this movie was an incredible journey the set was beautiful the cast was great and the soundtrack amazing my favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively it was achieved in a light hearted and caring way the original hopes and dreams of barbies existence are brought to life as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish in a world which does not always cater to womens needs this film does a great job of holding us all accountable we now live in a postbarbie movie era and im so excited to see what the future holds,0.9897,positive
719,bandymex,21-Jul-23,its a shame because i love little women and lady bird barbie did not serveits a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid im agreeing with the latter but the execution is just awful the ceo and corporate people of mattel started as a mock to men having all the top positions of a company as the movie goes theyre just there at the back of your mind and its unpleasant experience because they did not do anything after so many unnecessary scenes that couldve been meaningful for example whats the scene allan fighting other kens for there are so many seeds planted at once but none of them grew into their fullest potential here are some examples1 the mother and daughter relationship it started well the daughter is disconnected with her mother you thought the movie will revolve about fixing that problem no the daughter has no problem shes just a teenager2 mothers longing for her daughter the reason why barbie became curious about death is because the mother is playing with her barbie differently shes drawing weird sigh barbies you thought it was because she had a rough childhood and now is the time to heal her inner child no she misses her time playing with her daughter while it is an alright backstory i see no reason how it is related to barbie getting curious on death3 patriarchy its always shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses the corporate people who are all men tries to catch barbie so they can send her back to barbieland but barbie went to barbieland and they still followed her it took them too long to get there for no apparent reason and when they get there it just gets very confusing why are they in there4 barbie wanting to be human this shouldve been the theme of the movie the point of the movie shouldve been about what barbie saw to make her realize she wants to be human but no it was only a few minutes when shes seeing people laughing and some people are sad after that there was no more of it they tried to push this in the ending but it just doesnt feel right because of the lack of motivation although it was expected they wasted the whole time with cameos and other meaningless scenesi am disappointed in this movie its not worth the hype,-0.99,negative
720,liewphebe,6-Nov-23,i enjoyed the movie about how last time kids used to play with barbie and showed how they would be like in real life it also showed that how barbie can be incharge of their own life in real life and not restricted with doing the same thing every day barbie is a very interesting movie from dolls going to real life and actually expericing life but its kinda sad for them knowing that their world is very different from the real world where men dominates and women works under the men overall the movie was a very good movie and would highly recommend to watch especially those who love barbie dolls,0.9581,positive
721,Leemis,24-Jul-23,didnt know what to expect was pleasantly surprised clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the us liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle sticking together through intelligence compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure it encouraged acceptance of people with differences people that dont look like you and challenged the battles over whats feminine or whats masculine after all barbie and ken have no genitals,0.9785,positive
722,jonakirohima,20-Jul-23,spoilers ahead  firstly ryan gosling was the only good thing about this film the stupid thing is when barbie went to the real world she hated how there were a lot of males in leadership positions even though in barbie land it is entirely run by females and then wonders why ken wanted to change things in barbie land when she felt the same way as ken in the real world this lead to ken being the villain and no it was not will ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy then the really stupid thing comes at the end when she fights hard to change her home back into barbie land then decides to go and live in the real world which she hated because of the male dominance also the whole female dont have power thing is getting a bit old as these days there are strong powerful woman in successful leadership jobs,-0.9571,negative
723,cejanov,16-Aug-23,super boring movie it has a poor plot and everything is a cliche the barbie movie i watched recently left a lot to be desired the plot felt clich and predictable lacking any real depth or originality the characters were onedimensional and failed to engage my interest additionally the story quality was subpar making it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world they were trying to create overall i was disappointed with the lackluster storytelling and uninspiring execution of the moviewhy is there so much hype about this movie please dont watch this movie please its pathetic,-0.2263,negative
724,PhilClifford-Jones,9-Sep-23,although i had read varing opinions on the film i hadnt bought into them too much as i didnt want anything to be spoiled it isnt the standard kind of film i would watch but i found it fun colourful and heart felt with a sad honest but important undertone and message i dont see how embracing inclusivity equality femininity and respecting bodily and mental autonomy is a negative i think this film will make certain people uncomfortable and easily confused as to the message it is trying to convey but im glad they didnt dumb it down for those particular audiences and were brave enough not to pander my kids loved the film and it allowed for some discussion and reflection without breaking the fun vibe,0.9803,positive
725,giang-taquynh,23-Jul-23,the most political movie i have ever watched it is so confusing that you cant be sure what its target audience is it looks like they wanted it to be profound but putting too much woke content made it boring and cringe as a woman i honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beingsoverall 410 for good acting good music and good costumesi went to watch this movie as i heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep i was curious and i walked out of the cinema hall wishing that this movie was that simple as expected,0.9182,positive

729,yxzgjnydf,20-Jul-23,went to the wednesday barbie blow out showing  i went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie it wasnt anything i expected ive never seen a movie like this before on all levels from writing the sets every actor has such amazing range the way each scene transformed your mind set having you want more this movie was so good it was written with current real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with easter eggs while giving ode to the past and so self aware the writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles heartache dissonance into everyday life while making you cry of both laughter and sadness,0.9609,positive
730,vstvhkvhs,23-Jul-23,first off i will look at the positive aspects margot played a beautiful barbie not only was she pretty her acting skills shined however i felt that the message conveyed here was poor inappropriate or unnecessary i left the theater not feeling great about myself or the world i did not enjoy how they had to put ken down to make barbie better perhaps that is not what we should do perhaps we should make everyone betterthere were several clever references to pop culture that i thought were good but perhaps they should have pop culture references that people seeing barbie would like,0.8592,positive

732,nick-galanis,26-Aug-23,"have you watched barbieyes i am talking about the smash movie that topped the global box office broke records and made 1 billion dollars in just 17 dayswe watched the movie recently and couldnt help but think that the success was anything but coincidentalthis is the most successful movie directed by a woman everit champions intersectional feminism showing a world where1 black women can be presidents
2 trans women can be doctors
3 disabled women can dance and join the party
4 plus size women can be desired
5 mature women can mentor encourage and support younger women
6 men can be allies and support womens causeswhat i also loved is that the movie showed that1 men can find happiness when they decide to be themselves rather who society expects them to be
2 you can still be a man and cry and love yourself and support others without having to fight and prove your masculinity
3 women dont need men to be happy and vice versa
4 theres beauty in the mundane and everyday experiences such as going to the doctorit is obvious that the team behind this movie was incredibly diverseyou can see diversity of thought and willingness to include different people and groups in almost every scene  wow diversity  inclusion is not just the right and ethical thing for every company to do it is also something that creates masterpieces and makes  go barbie go diversity and inclusion",0.9982,positive
733,apriljosey-29034,27-Jul-23,so the barbie movie was mehtheres been a ton of hype about the films political bent and honestly yes the patriarchal nonsense is a bit heavy handed but thats not even what made it so badit was just dumbit was too long and nonsensical and i really dont know how to sum it up other than thati laughed a couple of times and one or two parts almost resonated with me but then it just went from relatable to preachy and i just eyerolled so hardit was mostly just boring and dumb and thats disappointing because it looked great the cast was great and it had such potential to be a great selfaware meta comedy it just failed so hard at doing thatmy summary barbie gains sentience fights the patriarchy becomes a real girl and goes to the gynecologistthis movie will not appeal to young kidsi can almost guarantee theyll find it boringits not a typical kids movie riddled with double entendres and overtheirheads adult humor its just adult humor and its not even particularly funny just my opinionit absolutely looks amazing it looks like it was made with kids in mind it looks like a nostalgia trip for moms and it looks like family funhowever with the exception of looking amazing it accomplishes none of that the mario movie did all of those things sooo much better in my opinion that movie was darn near perfectif you wanna see barbie go for it but if youre considering taking little kids i would not personally recommend it ,0.9902,positive
734,clerk8952,27-Sep-23,i was excited to see this movie because i heard gosling was so funny it starts out very strong the kens are laugh out loud funny gosling steals every scene he is in robbie isnt bad but they wrote her character to be emotional and boring in fact all of barbies are boring in comparison to the kens as the movie moves past barbieland it starts to struggle as the story develops there are several scenes from this point on focusing on how barbie robbie must find out who she is essentially these scenes drag on and kill any momentum the previous scene built the movie rams against the patriarchy often ironically the funniest scenes involve the kens and how the patriarchy benefits them then mattel comes into the story and that drags on this movie should have been 20 minutes shorter and focused more on overcoming stereotypes not condemning the patriarchy over and over legally blonde is a superior movie in so many ways,0.8197,positive

736,isaacnicholaschua,30-Jul-23,i know that barbie is for toy story 2 3 and 4 but this barbie is something else like a doctor a sports girl a cow girl in the city barbie is being used as a toy from the beginning of the movie the kids started to break tea cups tables and baby dolls barbie went to ugly barbie to go to the real world to find her kid i surprised that barbie had a memory of her kid who used to play with her that she doesnt nt like anymore so ken takes over barbie island while barbie lies down on the floor like a toy barbie and the other girls makes the boys go to war the old lady and barbie thought about a little girl who loved playing with barbie so much,0.2357,positive

738,wicked-rick,17-Sep-23,so many people have watched this movie and have absolutely dissected it to be something it isnt just sit back relax dont overthink it and its so enjoyable a good laugh and light hearted film would definitely recommend its funny crazy and random but its written so well the little comments and mentions of certain things by certain characters make you chuckle the story is good because it isnt just a movie of barbie it covers what barbie was and who barbie was and where barbie went and also ken and allan they cover all areas and manage to keep it light on the story and feelgood at the end,0.9773,positive

740,CatTheMovieCritic,27-Jul-23,"the movie is entertaining funny and it does touches on more serious topics there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeablethe way that the characters evolution is natural and interesting and i can sympathise with a lot of the charactersis a fun movie and making a barbie movie a pg13 is a really risky but innovative way of representing this iconic character
is also really important to notice that the movie because of its nature is going to cause a lot of polarisation and hate i think that the movie could have been more subtle on delivering the ideology but i understand why they didnt do it",0.8922,positive
741,rheinrich-79821,5-Sep-23,a beautiful light tale about the development and conditioning of identity and self esteem and how it can lead to stereotypical behavior and dependency in relationships but also how a person can get the intuition that it feels better to make a choice for another direction in ones life the first steps in this new direction starts with a new physical sensation in your feet and emotional associations about getting older and dying in the end like in the little mermaid you have to sacrifice things that were important to you but once you stepped into this new world it feels like being born for the second time superb movie,0.9704,positive
742,rjlyness,7-Aug-23,the opening scene parodying 21st century a space oddacy was hilarious i like it clever its an idea dropped into the world which changed the society fundamentally babies be gone professional dolls here we comei suppose its then interesting when barbie does encounter the real world and finds it not to have changed it does not represent the ideals they hold in the barbie world which they thought had spread through the world creating a new reality no barbie in the real world is just one idea in a sea of ideasits then fascinating to see ken enter the real world he finds out that barbie is not the only idea that exists there are others however instead of using this new information to find and build his own identity he quickly discoveres the patriarchyusing the pariachy as a tool to surpress and subordinate women in the world which women had built for themselves his whole life he has believed that all that matters is barbie and barbies world he therefore returns to barbieworld to use his new found power to dominate as a form of revenge his obsession with barbie has not dissappeard it has manifest in a new way he is now taking revenge on himself in a way as he acts out behaviours which serve him superficially but dont actually nourish his soul his true person hes mimicking the behavior or barbie trying to make her feel the way he felt toxic masculinity and domination its an identity born out of pain and obsessionhis story ach is the most simple to understand he learns from barbie that he can love himself he can form his own identity which doesnt revolve around someone else his identity can be one which is very personal to him and not one that exists to serve the needs of others or to impress others he ends his obsession and idolization of barbie and looks to love his friends his kensbarbie existing in barbieworld finds herself to be always happy fully in love with herself and powerful in that love for herself she creates an entire world which functions beautifully or so she believesits almost like barbieworld is the internal personal world of an imagined player of the barbie game its ordered and structured to produce good outputs mental stability this sense of perfect is safe and change is not welcome why would barbie ever want to change when barbie is perfecthowever the real world as barbie later finds out is messy and complex we watch as the feelings insecurities and anziety of the mother gloria are spilled onto the page and into the world of barbiebarbie goes to weird barbie who shes is told can cure herweird barbie is the way that she is because some child decided they didnt want to be any of the barbies that were in offer and so created her own character in a rather chaotic manner weird barbie is created out of emotional expression and therfore has the ability to feel her negative emotionsshe offers barbie the choice to go back to how things were before or to go on a mission to find the source of the problem barbie instantly chooses to revert back and not to address the problem barbie embodies a toxic positivity and fear of change which prevents her from accepting or noticing the problems within her reality and within the real world fear of change fear of negative emotionsin later entering the human world she encounters lots of negativity which she doesnt know how to address its not in her programming its not what i am made for eventually we see her sit looking out to the sea and look internally in doing this she is able to access and feel her emotions the fear the insecurity the

ideal must dieit would be beautiful if they discontinued the original barbie doll after this filmthe ideal never really exitedits a slightly dissatisfying ending in a way because all of the power imbalances and structural patriarchal or matriarchal in the barbie world ideas still persistthe fascist idiology as the daughter put itthe world of women in power is confined to an imaginary world and men remain dominant in mattel and in the real worldwe dont see a story arch for the society as it never really changes were told in a way to accept that only incremental tiny changes are allowed and large structural reform is pushed aside as unrealistic,0.992,positive

746,jjasonh,26-Jul-23,the barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot but was overall a hilarious movie to watch while many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men they are looking at it the wrong way they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them all while keeping the barbie theme at the heart of the plot it addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is a patriarchy which isnt necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in powerful positions in society,0.9695,positive

752,RyanGoslins-son,21-Jul-23,the movie is amazing margot robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a truman show vibe for me  ryan gosling is amazing as ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles however i feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that arent specific to feminism overall i do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie for example if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative in conclusion i feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 78 for me personally at least a 85 or higher therefore i have decided to put 1010 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly,0.9836,positive
753,livtodai,25-Aug-23,"the whole movie is a gentle punch of love covered in perfect pink you dont have to be perfect you are who you are and your existence itself shall be of intrinsic valuebarbie was created to be a playmate for girls inspiring them to grow and become outstanding and successful women in all walks of lifebut in the real world barbie found that she had not fulfilled her mission at all her perfect body and appearance caused women body anxiety and appearance anxiety served as an accomplice to the objectification of women she has been sugarcoated by capitalism to be propaganda for consumerism and unrealistic physical ideas destroyed growth of innate sense of worth and has set the equal rights movement back 50 yearsbarbie fell into a deep existential crisis if i cant fulfill my mission what is the meaning of my existence
the answer given by the director comes from a place of love your existence itself has intrinsic value you dont have to earn it and you have every right to define the meaning of your existencewhen i looked at the qq music original soundtrack comment section i realized that many audience have been moved to tears so was i especially during below parts1 a conversation between barbie and an old woman on a bench at a bus stopin the world where barbie lives there is no aging or death and everyone is always young and exquisite when she came to the real world she met an old lady and for the first time she looked at this face full of wrinkles and said sincerely  you are beautiful which represents her acceptance of aging and the imperfect being of the world and also represents she has been able to make her own definition of beauty for the very first time ever and this is the first step for her innate sense of self to emergefor a long time in the perfect barbielandnarratives of consumerism only perfect and exquisite high heels and clothes slim and graceful figure and face decent residence and cars and luxurious parties are beauty but this time barbie defines beauty in a different way by herselfonly when she truly accepts herself the self who doesnt like high heels has cellulite on her legs will age and die will be confused and sad can she truly accept the outside world and other people without criticism and only by true acceptance of the world other people and herself one can generate genuine respect only then can she look at the old grand ladys hunched back and wrinkled face and still think it is beautifulin my opinion apart from aging sickness and death all other worries in life are merely a matter of values but aging sickness and death have no solution being able to reconcile with aging is not only the calmness of watching ones vitality disappear little by little but also the courage to face the countdown to death and the courage to accept this helplessness and cherish every minute of life even morethis reminds me of a related story long long ago in a faraway land a king received a prophecy that his son would either become the greatest king ever lived in history or become an unprecedented spiritual leader the king thought of the thin poor and sloppy practitioners wandering around he has seen in the past and was very afraid that his son would abandon the road of ruling and become such so he built an exquisite luxurious and enclosed pavilion for him a walled garden of earthly delights and endless enjoyment only the healthy the young and the happy were allowed inside immersed in the pleasures of senses the prince came of age protected from the limitations of mortal being and signs of decay and aging but one day the prince grew curious of outside and wanted to travel outside so the king ordered all the elderly sick or dying people to hide at home during the princes visit but during his visit outside god deliberately sent an old man to hobble alongside the road and appeared in the princes sight the prince saw an old man for the first time realized the existence of aging for the first time and the world and the paradise he once knew collapsed upon him then he ran back to his palace with shock and despair just like children when they encountered troubles outside were bullied theyd run home to let their parents solve the problem but this time no ones parents couldnt solve this trouble not even if his father was the king of the whole universe he still could not protect his son from the knowledge of mortality later in order to free the world from the suffering of life aging sickness and death the prince resolutely abandoned everything and embarked on the road of no return after going through all kinds of hardships and dangers he finally nirvana and became an unprecedented spiritual leader2 barbie observed the environment in the park on the bench alone and felt the strong and various emotions of human beings for the first time the warmth of sunlight the mottled tree shadows and the gentle breeze of wind barbie shed a tear cause before this she had never felt these emotions now she has felt what it was like to be alive for the very first timethe human world is not only filles with happiness but also anxiety sadness and helplessness but its all those lows that make those happy moments all the more precious3 warmth of your gazeken was created as an accessory to barbie who would always stand on the beach waiting for barbie to say hello to him he has no home no friends no job no ideals no ego ken symbolizes lovestruck girls who lost their sense of self he projects the ideals and the fantasies of the best qualities a person can have onto a specific person who he does not know yet making this person an everjudging god for him only when barbies eyes are on him is he happy barbies rejection has validated his miserable existence but this is not true love this is why when barbie said to ken you must discover who you are without me this feels so warm its the movies gentle message to all girls who are deeply troubled by love to find their self againits not barbie and ken
its not ken and barbie
its barbie and its ken4 at the end the conversation between barbie and the founder ruth is like a kid and a benevolent old mother the background music of what was i made for only made it harder to hold my tears for those who have been or are looking for the meaning of life this scene would strike you you created me dont you control me dont i need your permission to be a human if theres higher existence who created us does he hope to give us complete freedom to choose our beliefs our values our actions and by freedom i mean he does not rely on miracles or bread or promises of heaven to lure us to guide us but to allow us to choose completely freely and can we afford the heavy burdens of this freedom so many people couldnt bear it and choose various biased ideologies to get rid of the pain of independent thinking to get rid of the loneliness of finding meaning in the context of nihilismin the end barbies ending is also the most inspiring story ending ever because she didnt choose to stay in edenlike barbieland but chose to become a real human seeing that the human world is imperfect is filled with anxiety and sadness aging and death she still chooses this path because what she wants is an adventure so compelling that the pain and suffering of life as well as the aging and death would all become worthwhile only in this way can she feel her own existenceno longer a manufactured thing but the creator of her own destiny the definer of her own meaninghumans only have one ending but ideas flew foreverand barbie has no ending",0.9963,positive
754,a-45215,23-Jul-23,barbie starts off with a promising blend of satire and clever dialogue but as the story transitions into the real world the film becomes tiresome and less captivating like oil and water it attempts to provide entertainment but is hindered by heavyhanded messages it is not your typical childrens film instead it feels more like a production geared towards teenagers laden with political propaganda and mockery of traditional valuesthe film seems intent on conveying a manifesto against a cruel and unrealistic reality while addressing the existential crisis faced by women however for male viewers like myself the film feels peculiar and confusing due to its irrelevant and comical political undertonesit also appears to take on the role of a feminist campaign attempting to portray women as equal to men through ironic and puzzling means unfortunately some of the intended messages get lost in translation and lack proper delivery the perplexing ending where barbies creator claims she can choose her destiny as if referring to a tragedy as a gift only adds to the overall confusion and lack of clarity regarding barbies originsperhaps with the addition of more appropriate dialogue this plastic doll movie could have been an enjoyable watch instead of morphing into a misguided attempt to indoctrinate children with politics,-0.9421,negative
755,gatvideosmkii,22-Jul-23,ill be honest i wasnt expecting much from barbie but this was bad an awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie there is a good movie in there somewhere but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue i personally would not recommend watching this in theaters if i hadnt been watching it with my friends so that we could joke about how bad it was i would have felt that i had wasted 2 hours of my life of course maybe this movie just isnt my cup of tea other than the poor plot i thought that the acting was done reasonably well about what you would expect with the cast of the movie and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well,-0.3747,negative
756,timeless-98678,21-Aug-23,the movie was unexpectedly fun starting from all the references related to the actual barbie doll to the costumes and till even the barbie world itself overall i think there is a good balance between satire and sincerity crammed with impeccable attention to details even tough as a watcher i expected barbie to be the star of the show in many moments ken was actually such a fun scenestealer that at one point i felt the movie should truly be barbie and keni could totally agree to the fact that the movie is a riotous candy colored feminist fable and its true that barbie does many of the things weve been promised there is much mocking and loving of barbie and plenty of costumes but none of those things make it subversive from my point of view its a movie that enormously pleased with itself but even tough its very pretty its not that very deep,0.9519,positive

758,cmzmsnw,22-Jul-23,this movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly it turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess it wasnt funny or entertaining any hope for entertainment was lost immediately any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators the fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie,0.5803,positive

764,cklmewmew,22-Jul-23,this movie had so much potential it was doing so well for a while it was funny and clever and had depth and i was super excited to see where it was going to go but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent even problematic conclusion im almost angry at it even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them diebtw its definitely not for under 12s there is nothing inappropriate in it so they could technically watch it for the visual aspect they just wouldnt understand much spoilers some of the elements where the movie deeply disappointed me are below please dont read any further if you havent watched the film yet and want these elements to be a surprisekens developmentken realises that men arent treated as equals in barbieland and creates his own patriarchy which in the end the barbies tear down when ken bursts into tears thinking that he will have to go back to a life where he is oppressed  that could have been developed and executed so beautifully barbie even told him its ok to cry this could have moved towards all kens understanding that they need to express their vulnerable emotions in order to not be angry and toxic and the barbies need to stop the oppression of men because its just as bad as oppressing anyone and it could have led to equality in barbieland but no turns out ken is in fact crying because he has an unhealthy anxious attachment to barbie and his ego cant take the news that barbie is not in love with him and then the movie concludes with ken agreeing to explore who he is individually without barbie this would be an ok conclusion if it wasnt for abandoning all the other deeper seeds planted before with some other kens getting middle management jobs in the once again matriarchal barbieland society but not leadership positions the same way it is for women in the real world seriously its like this was written by men the barbies are going for revengebarbies developmentbarbie wants to be human and again this could have been developed with emotional and intellectual depth and there is an attempt at the beginning to show the reason barbie started to have these thoughts where she is seeing humans express all these complex emotions and shes seeing the beauty of the world around her in all those small magical details in nature that feel more intense than usual but then this thread is dropped completely so much so that in the end when barbie is asking to be human it doesnt make sense why and the narrator has to literally do a voiceover speech to explain it badly and then when she is finally human her first and very overhyped trip is to the gynaecologist implying that what shes most excited about being human is having a vagina again written by men this movie is literally setting women back 50 yearsdevelopment of the mother  daughter relationshipnot much to say other than how shallow this remains despite setting it up as if it was going to go somewhere barbie goes to the real world to find this teenage girl whose emotions are causing her to malfunction the malfunctioning focused on cellulite which is a whole other horror story it then turns out its actually the girls mum who is playing with barbie and feeling these emotions because her life isnt fun and her daughter is hostile with her and then at some point out of nowhere the mother and daughter start hugging and smiling at each other thats it were not going into why she was hostile in the first place and why she isnt any more teenagers are not hostile for no reason were not touching on why the mum was feeling that way and what made her not feel that way any more it clearly wasnt just her daughter but everything is suddenly fine now oh ok thenallanthis is so chaotic i dont even know where to start so he has a particularly sensitive  gay  queer vibe and i think they are trying to make him into a hero like he fights a bunch of kens for no apparent reason  they really could have used that scene for something else but the point of him is unclear hes an ally to the barbies and theres only one of him which i always think is actually a bit problematic to have only one token representative of the lgbtq community in a film although i get that in real life mattel didnt have that much diversity and they were trying to stay true to that his motivation siding with the barbies in the patriarchy seems to be the fact that he feels invisible too but the movie doesnt go into this at all and kind of ignores him the same way the characters do like hes a hero simply by being different from the kens and helping the barbies but how he feels throughout this and what he gets out of it in the end if anything is anyones guess its not clear whether or how things change for him at all they dont seem to despite all the effortweird barbiewhen barbies are played with too hard they turn weird  strange make up and clothes cut and messed up hair always in splits so far very funny but why does weird barbie remain perceived weird throughout why doesnt anyone realise that she is just as beautiful still as the other barbies despite her unusual hair and makeup and nonperfection or why doesnt anyone realise that she basically saves barbieland and it doesnt matter in the slightest what she looks like shes a hero thanks for making all girls who are unusuallooking or not stereotypically beautiful and perfect feel like freaksespecially because of weird barbie and allan the movies diversity just feels so forcedthe board of mattel all real world men who are painfully stupidwith will farrell as ceo first of all what was funny 20 years ago is not really funny any more will farrell should only be in this if there is some clear development of the narrative behind his behaviour but there isnt its all a bit of a mess we get a kick out of the mockery of foolish men at the beginning but they are still in power regardless of anything they are trying to put barbie back in a box but she escapes another missed opportunity  what would have happened if she goes in the box then they chase her into barbieland for no reason they wanted her to go back she goes back so why dont they just celebrate and stay where they are and then theres literally no point of them being there was casting will farrell just an attempt to get middle aged toxic men into the cinemathe cellulite issuebarbie agrees to go to the real world so that she doesnt get cellulite literally i do understand sarcasm and i get that this would be quite funny if we as a society were beyond that already and if there werent any teenage girls watching but the film is a 12 and the beauty industry is making more money out of womens insecurities now than ever if were going to use sarcasm here this needs to be addressed later for example barbie realising that its our uniqueness that makes us beautiful they really missed an opportunity using weird barbie to drive that message and cellulite doesnt matter but no such thing  the movie concludes with the message that cellulite is indeed a malfunction this has got to have been written by menapparently the only man involved in the screenplay was noah baumbach ah coproduced by mattel of course all the male mattel executives must have had a say now it makes sense the movie is fun to watch and its certainly witty especially in the first half and i really liked the performances and visuals there seems to have been strong intention of depth and the movie is very political but ultimately fails to convey the right message and all it ends up being is a clever brand extension to make more money for mattel,0.9942,positive

768,dheit-05546,23-Jul-23,i think greta gerwig perfectly threaded the needle between astute social commentary on barbie and a love letter to the doll that shaped america it is a campy oasis in the midst of an industry that seems to increasingly worship somber realism it has all the charm of an 80s cult classic on a 2023 budget alongside hilarious writing that made my cheeks hurt by the end is incredible set and costume design and standout acting performances from a remarkably cohesive cast there are also subtle details i really appreciated like barbies car being a 1959 corvette the same year the doll was released ill knock one star off because in a few moments towards the end the plot gets lost in itself and it feels like they are speaking in riddles,0.927,positive

when barbie saw what the real world was like i felt tears running down my face i was so hurt by the truth i mean not even in this barbie movie we can forget about the unfair world for women but without it the movie wouldnt be as greata big part of the movie was emotional and i thought that was great when they talked about death i really felt itoverall the movie was way more than i thought it would be and i definitely recommend it the humor isnt hilarious but i chuckled when jokes were relatable",0.9463,positive
770,elzepaliukaite,20-Jul-23,the movie did something that has never been done before the details the music comedy and my favourite the outifts i could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a barbie i truly reccomend you warching this film not only it is entertaining but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself the movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worsei have no doubt that this is the best greta gerwigs movie yet and i hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff,0.9896,positive
771,magpiehepburn,25-Jul-23,massive fan of margot robbie but she is so much better than thisfrom the get go this film has no context and just looks like it was rushed together it certainly has some funny parts but there are few and far between the film centres to much around a fake world and not enough in the real world there is also to many rude references which to be honest werent necessary i get it a 12a but surely they knew many of us would be bringing kids alongit was not a fun ride and will be one film that i will be forgetting about quite quickly potential was there but the storyline wasnt disappointed,0.9223,positive
772,pshcpa,9-Aug-23,i watched the barbie movie last night overall i would say that its a very creative dare i say outstanding movie the premise is brilliant albeit kind of uncomfortable with its generalization of gender roles and what id like to think were hyperbolic stereotypes but i am a guy and i definitely have my blind spots as many know however i do try to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem after all i do have many capable and strong women in my life that im concerned whether they get treated fairlybut despite these slightly unsettling misgivings its a really funny movie the mixed animation and live action is remarkable and many of the characters are really well written that is aside from the male characters theyre all pretty much one dimensional dullards who generally cant get out of their own way thus its a mix of humorous social commentary with keystone cop slapstick but its so visually rich its like a cinematic ice cream sundaemargot robbie was made for this role her performance was a combination of sweet naivete and compelling poignancy and she looks like a barbie thats remarkable many of the other barbie dolls were performed excellently as well kate mckinnon is really funny in it even though it seemed at times she was adlibriffing a la snl with one eye on the audience but shes very good as the bad barbie i was surprised and pleased to see john cena make an appearance or two as the neptune ken that was pretty funnyboth ryan gosling and simon liu were good as ken and    well ken their characters actually had a little depth to them which allowed them to grow a little over the course of the story america ferrera is a good actor and she was solid but not compelling for my taste her climatic speeches were heavyhanded but they did serve a story development purposeso in short i really enjoyed the movie it was visually compelling and much of the acting outstanding while the story may rankle some ogs out there for anyone who wasis married or has a daughter or a sister or a mother i guess thats everyone they know that women often times have suffered from gender bigotry and so being sympathetic to that i think theyll find it is a really good movie and theres probably nothing wrong with being reminded of that struggle now and thenoh and the music its got a great soundtrack and the final song what was i made for written by both billie eilish and finneas oconnell and sung by billie stopped me in my tracks what a well written song that was so apropos and memorable,0.9988,positive
773,gabrielddimitrov,23-Jul-23,the comedy was ok at times otherwise this movie has a modern political agenda and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated i understand the need for awareness of womens rights possibilities and freedom its here even in the 21st century especially in some countries however im not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message or make it even worse as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie but more of a parody of a movie i love margot robbie and ryan gosling but this piece is definitely overrated,0.9356,positive
774,bloomwu,23-Jul-23,i never had high expectations for the film due to the number of justokay films that have come out this past year but greta never disappoints lady bird little women and now barbie the movie is surely a gerwig classic it is amazing how the outright unserious campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated realworld issues naturally there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach the writing carried witty humor strong character development and heartfelt experiences all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances margot robbies performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial the same can be said for ryan goslings ken spoilers it is clear that everything ken has done to barbieland bringing patriarchy was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth what he feels he often lacks in barbieland the film features a multitude of wellknown actors that portray a great deal of what a barbie can be the set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a barbie dream house and her clothes were extremely coveted by young girls on the other hand it shows how barbieland is not all it is thought out to be i was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old hollywood soundstage musicals that we never really see anymore this film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to america ferreras performance her monologues feminist themes are reminiscent of saorise ronans monologue from little women it was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity resonating with audiences while the message is not at all new many women especially feel heard the film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up the simultaneous laughing and crying sort overall barbie is a fun glittery social commentary satire about female identity the feminism of hyperfemininity authenticity and community and what it means to be human in our messedup chaotic world for the gerwig fans barbie lovers barbie haters and everyone else go watch barbie,0.997,positive
775,sabinasbuzoi,23-Jul-23,this movie has fun aesthetics and fun costumes and sometimes funny moments definitely great actors but the whole ideological feminist spin greta gerwig did in the plot ruins the entire thing honestly and turns a movie that could have been super fun into a bland and boring one i thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society like why does the male gender not own houses why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account and it the end they still dont get houses also this is a misrepresentation of the real world as a woman with a career and decent income i can tell you i in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues instead of portaying equality the movie ends on a note where the male species is dumb and still not on equal footing disappointing,0.9121,positive
776,ranmadmax,1-Nov-23,ah the barbie dolla cultural icon that has been both revered and reviled often in the same breath the 2023 film barbie takes us on a whimsical yet poignant journey through the plastic corridors of barbieland a realm that mirrors our own societal norms and prejudices in a way that is both amusing and unsettlingthe film opens in a utopia of sorts where barbies hold esteemed positions and kens are relegated to the beach but all is not well in paradise barbie our protagonist is plagued by an existential crisis that leads her on a quest for selfdiscovery accompanied by her everloyal ken ah the follies of youth even for a doll that never agesthe narrative takes a dark turn when barbie and ken venture into the real world confronting issues of body image gender roles and corporate greed the film doesnt shy away from tackling these heavy subjects and it does so with a deft touch that is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking the days of rebel without a cause may be long gone but the angst of youth remains evergreenthe character of weird barbie serves as a delightful foil to our heroine embodying the societal outcasts who often possess the most wisdom her role in barbies awakening is crucial providing a counterpoint to the superficial world from which she hailshowever the films most striking moment comes when barbie meets the spirit of ruth handler the reallife creator of the barbie doll this metaconversation serves as a reminder that even the most seemingly trivial of objects can have a profound impact on our lives and culture its akin to a modernday wizard of oz where the man behind the curtain is actually a womanthe film concludes on a hopeful note with barbie and her plastic compatriots embarking on a journey of selfimprovement and societal change its a fitting end to a film that challenges our preconceptions at every turn,0.8992,positive
777,kemesk-58198,30-Jul-23,really good soundtracks and amazing cast margot robbie and ryan gosling were incredible the jokes were funny too i also liked the little details in the movie like barbies iconic clothes or the matrix reference back with weird barbie but the story and overall everything wasnt as exceptionally good and enjoyable as everybody promises especially if we compare it to the quantity of hype and advertising it got also i wasnt and im still not sure what audiences it is for sure they say its for everybody but no i dont think its for everybody shortly worth to watch but definitely not a godfather,0.9361,positive
778,joleensanders,22-Jul-23,greta gerwig brings the fun to the well known toy of generations barbie based on the trailers and interviews my hopes were high that it was going to be a fun and campy ride in the barbie mobile i would say it hit a few speed bumps women empowerment and understanding barbie was spot on bringing in the discontinued dolls and ideas was brilliant i feel the kens storyline was were the potholes were why cant it be barbies world and not so strong on a beating over the head that ken is nothing that kens only recourse is to take over that ken in the end still isnt supporting barbie as it should be that might be controversial and some might say i missed the point but i want my son to see it and come away with equality not that he should be diminished if we want equality we need to model what a supportive boyman should be partnership anybody,0.7138,positive
779,trinerosenville,30-Jul-23,i loved barbie as a child so when my teenage daughter wanted to go see it at the premiere i was onthe movie started out great and i really enjoyed the first part with all the funny details and i loved that they made sure to also include a lot of the most hilarious discontinued barbie productsthe silly and perfect take on barbieland with the amazing actress margot robbie playing stereotypical barbie was hitting all the right notes and i couldnt wait till she was introduced to the hard reality of the real worldsadly this is where the innovative and creative vibe ends as the real world is just as if not even more silly and unrealistic than barbieland  presenting an extreme reality where unintelligent powerhungry men completely run the world and not one single women is able the have any job of significancemaking the entire thing even worse atleast the last 45 mins of the movie is the morale of well everythingto be honest ive never been a big fan of ryan gosling and sadly his role as ken didnt help it wasnt really funny just sad and the big moment when the barbies was fighting back wasnt really him realising he was wrong just that him and the other kens couldnt really do anything about the fact that the women had taken over barbieland and they just gave upall in all barbie was a great idea with a great cast and its obvious that they had done their homework when it came to the history of barbie sadly it ended up as quite a mess as the story didnt make any sense  leaving me with a lot of questions,0.9788,positive
780,simonovadariya,27-Oct-23,after months of seeing teasers and trending expectations about barbie i walked into the movie theater with my dad not knowing what to expectthe movie began fun and easygoing  and it was exciting to see margot and ryan in such entertaining roles the first things that catch the eye are the colorful details in the scenes and catchy jokes and phrases until barbie and ken enter the real worldthe rest of the movie seemed like waves of different atmospheres the first scene that had an impact on me was when barbie after recognizing her owner sits at the bus stop and meets the elderly woman the dialogue was really short yet had an impact on me and made me feel connected to the movie as a young womanafter adventures both in the real and the barbie world another scene that makes a big statement in the movie is america ferreras monologue about what women face now both me and my dad dont get impressed to easily and we are quite critical but my heart began beating so fast with every word she said and as soon as the monologue ended  my dad started clapping and so did the whole theater it was a beautiful momentand after a combination of hilarious moments and meaningful conversations came the climax of the movie which i did not expect barbie meets her creator this scene completely isolated the two characters from the rest of the movie they share an unforgettable conversation as billies soundtrack what was i made for begins playing this is when my heart began fluttering and i felt so still tears rolled out of my eyes before i even knew it the room was silent a movie hasnt made me cry in a long time and this felt like a release of emotion i couldnt controlhowever this is not quite the ending the ending scene shows barbie now in the real world completing an activity women do youll understand once you watch the movie and the movie hilariously ends with nicki minajs songwhen it came to an end i really needed a moment to process what ive just seen it felt like a big part of my childhood and my girlhood has been acknowledged and ive never felt a feeling like this before i can now imagine myself in the future showing this movie to my future daughter in my opinion this is a mustwatch for all women you will not regret it,0.9914,positive

784,sketchbooktown,1-Aug-23,it was funny gorgeously done and challenged peoples view points which is a lot done for a movie made by a toy company i found myself laughing and tearing up at certain points i was in awe while watching it in the theaters for the attention to detail on props its insane how well made it isspoilers ish  my only critique is the ending for the kens we sympathise with them throughout the movie and the message is about equal rights for women but feminism is about equal rights for everyone kens deserve their freedom too however it definitely did the job of making men step out of their comfort zone and understanding what its really like to be a woman,0.9703,positive
785,sicrefi,8-Aug-23,i did not like this movie i went because of the good reviews but i should have known it was all the hype i went thinking it would be fun but it was a letdown i almost walked out and expected more but it never happened i cant believe that anyone would give this move a good review it was so cheesy the sexual undertones are a bit too much for many young kids i saw in the theatre i would not take any children under 14 to this movie this is definitely not a kid movie i loved margot robbie in the wolves of wallstreet and with babylon a huge flop this is another big letdown they spent so much money on advertising this film and it is no surprise to me now on why they had to spend so much money because this move would have flopped if they didnt spend so much money on advertising now after seeing it i am sick of seeing barbie,0.9148,positive
786,clicquotcommie,19-Aug-23,from the opening scenes alluding to the greatest film of all time this movie was captivating witty hilarious aesthetic philosophical surreal unapologetically feminine and feminist just masterful filmmaking that made every minute a delight to watch and made you look forward to rewatching it it pulled no punches in criticism of capitalism and patriarchy i dont agree with criticism that it was a commercial for mattel since they clearly gave greta final edit really dont cant think of a bad thing to say but i do think that this movie felt like a cultural reset that it has changed movies forever in the best possible way,0.9209,positive
787,barragart,24-Jul-23,i went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations even though i admire greta gerwig a lot but not even fifteen minutes into the movie i was already laughing and crying and hooked it is definitely one of the funniest ive seen in at least 2 years it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else the message is powerful and easy to understand i found it refreshing and truthful sometimes it may feel even a bit naive but in the end it is what it is and i appreciated that the performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with even though the tone is satiric and farcical great movie a lot more than i expected,0.992,positive
788,palchiica,24-Jul-23,right of the bat i should say that i only got interested in this movie because it featured ryan gosling  and honestly if it wasnt for him the movie wouldnt even get one star from methe movie theater was filled with little girls while i think this isnt really something a kid should be watchingit wasnt inspiring at all for me nor did it make me emotional the point wasnt really well made in fact it mostly ended up being corny and wornout i really found it hard to sit through the whole movie especially the ending scenes i just wanted it to finally be over wasnt really worth all the hype and the money spent,0.1004,positive
789,ladyevyan,23-Aug-23,i really enjoyed this movie every barbie that i grew up with gets featured no i did not own them all i love the story and the fact that all ages can get something out of it which made it feel even more relateablethe story does have it flaws but are quite foregiveable i thinki know some people are complaining about the characteristics of ken but if you were into barbie in the 80s you would know that ken has always been as he is displayed in the movie he never was gi joe that is for surei love the fact of the deeper layer and message in the film i will recommend it to anyone that is open to the pinkness ,0.9031,positive
790,toriraphael,22-Jul-23,just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages the cast and direction of the film were amazing the set pieces and art direction was inspired additionally the script was air tight and very funny i cried and laughed throughout the film i truly believe the movie will become a classic the only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding i think gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging i would recommend this movie for everyone,0.9828,positive
791,kieranaron,18-Aug-23,a popcorn movie i define as a movie that i dont need to take seriously or get to invested i can just sit back with my popcorn and enjoy it and thats exactly what barbie was for me i really just enjoyed getting into the barbie world and all its quirks and joys if your gonna do a barbie movie i believe this would be the best way to go about it that being said i think there are some parts that i believe take you out movie a little and i felt at some points the movie struggled with trying to send a message it was very on the nose and whilst that works at some points it took me out of it on others character wise i believe the casting was perfect margot robbie as barbie i couldnt imagine anyone else and ryan gosling carried the film comedically the supporting cast was amazing aswell and everyone played their part perfectly overall i would definitely watch this again and it was great joy to turn off my brain and just have fun with it ,0.9936,positive
792,deveshkedia-46043,24-Jul-23,i have to express my disappointment with this movie as it is riddled with an overwhelming number of loopholes and plot holes that hinder the overall viewing experience its quite disheartening to find that there is a noticeable absence of a compelling and engaging story leaving the audience wanting more substance and coherencefrankly i cannot help but think that investing time in watching this film is not the best use of ones entertainment hours instead i would suggest diverting attention to purchasing a barbie doll allowing for a more enjoyable and imaginative playtime experiencein conclusion i find it regrettable that this movie fails to live up to expectations and i consider it to be an utter waste of valuable time and cinematic potential,-0.7803,negative
793,jamesmcwhirty,5-Aug-23,the bright colours will appeal to youngsters and thankfully the mindless feminism will sail over their heads the feminism sticks with young adults but the nostalgia wont appeal and for oldies the nostalgia is fun but the poor script and acting is appalling i think mattel have highlighted in a 2 hour film why their toy is now completely obsolete no matter how hard they try to rebrand it if you like comedy watch the trailer its not just a highlights reel it is the enitrely of anything amsuing in the whole film the cast made the best of a bad script but the writers have missed an opportunity to make a classic comedy for the ages,0.7732,positive

796,bcummi,22-Jul-23,with some of the greatest casting seen in a film looking at you alan this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch maggot robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism anxiety and true ennui she questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out ryan gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery understanding and empathy incredible costumes sets choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen great gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion making us all wonder if the power of barbie can truly help to heal the real world,0.9831,positive
797,tylerwfortenberry,26-Jul-23,spoilers sort ofbarbie is something most of us grew up around in some form of fashion whether we played with them with our sisters stole them when she wasnt looking or hated them and stuck to our hot wheels and gi joes in this instance barbie is not the same barbie we played with but a woman who is comfortable with complacency and is forced to fight the patriarchy while also find her purposefrom the set to the costumes barbie did a wonderful job of bringing us into the world of barbieland and reminding us of what the houses and cars used to look like and how she was just a little too big for everything sure there was some dialogue that was aloof and in need of some reworking and kens character was multi faceted  but nontheless it had a powerful two fold message to deliverbarbie is a film that has been so hyped up by the public and its duality of opening at the same time as oppenheimer that you cant help but want to see it to stay in the cultural loop at the same time barbie takes what should have been an entirely superficial script and goes just below the surface to remind us of our humanity the world we built and our opportunity for self determination personally i think this was a brilliant way to engage moviegoers and a great way to disembark from the surface level franchise films many of us are accustomed to watching its comedic and relevant quips and nods entertained while its double message challenged audiences to think critically about our world and their own places in itwhile i am not surprised by the out of place moments this is a hollywood movie after all i was pleasantly taken back by the journey we went on with stereotypical barbie and her discovery of what it means to have free will i highly suggest seeing this at least once and with your mom if you can,0.994,positive
798,germandane,22-Jul-23,i adored ryan gosling as ken and margot robbie was perfect as barbie parents this is not a movie for little kids the beginning was hopeful and i loved the cast and the amazing set of barbie land barbies playhouse was amazing but as it went on it became way too political and preachy and went downhill if i did this movie i would have made it a love story between ken and barbie and had them get married making use of all the cool barbie toys and her friends but of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect even though thats what most people still do these days so it was a way cool set amazing cast but way too political for my taste,0.9847,positive
799,sxwbsbg,27-Jul-23,this movie was wonderful i went in with lowered expectations because i find the majority of big movies dont live up their hype this was not the case here beautiful acting and message without being too pushy it was very accessible it didnt pander and it didnt condescend the dialogue felt very real and not scripted so much fun and tons of funny moments the only thing i questioned was why the montage at the end didnt include some of the pain and sad moments of human existence it sort of made ruth saying i cant in good conscience a strange thing to include im hoping this will maybe make it into an expanded version,0.8012,positive
800,jlnewps,26-Jul-23,i thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself most scenes last 12 minutes too long and the ending is terrible no resolve was ever made to the story which leaves we have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before politics aside this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess one positive is the set design and costumes were amazing the actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown but most jokes are over used or just fall flat,0.8339,positive

802,odontogmurillo,19-Aug-23,anyone who says the movie is good is undoubtedly a barbie fan it is a film with a poor script filled with a lot of padding sometimes somewhat absurd but which is necessary to be able to meet the duration of the film and nothing more the social representation of the main characters is disappointing belittling both the female and male gender on many occasions and with a slightly distorted conceptualization of common thinking in relation to the characters one or the other rescues the development of the film due to its trajectory on the big screen but nothing exceptional this is without a doubt a film that i would not see again on any given sunday while i rest even if im being honest its on my list of the worst movies ive seen in my last 15 years but be the witness yourself in short i can say that it is a film with great marketing management whose work team deserves a big applause,0.7848,positive

805,breathinglifehouse,23-Jul-23,went into this movie knowing itd be hilariously awkward robbie as barbie and gosling as ken also a great supporting cast including ferrell cena cera ferrera liu mckinnon just to name a few it was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism but thats to be expected when its a barbie movie this film had great costume and set designs and will win oscars for those two categories for sure it will most likely be nominated in all the major categories my only hope is that this destroys mission impossible at the box office so we can witness barbie defeating tom cruise worth a watch and probably a rewatch once it goes up for rent digitally,0.9434,positive
806,alexleroy-30178,22-Jul-23,acting is good margot did an amazing job at portraying barbie even though ryan as ken absolutely stole the show to be honest humour wasnt amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times plot is slightly messy not horrible like i get it but the movie didnt really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects another thing that bothered me was the waste of will ferrells character who could have been a better villain that simply an incapable clown i still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because its execution cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a masterpiece,0.9663,positive
807,SwitchSwitch366,21-Sep-23,i wasnt expecting much from this movie and being honest i thought it was weird that barbie of all things was getting a live action movie nonetheless i still wanted to give this movie a chance since i used to watch the animated movies as a kid with my sister upon finally getting to watch it i would have to say its pretty boringbarbie starts off fairly well but like nearly half way through i loose interest in watching it the idea of barbie having an existential crisis is a great idea and i think the first half of the movie did a good job at that however it kind of lost its edge the longer the movie went on margot robbie plays barbie wonderfully and is honestly the best thing about the movie second being michael cera and third being john cena i some what liked ken too because he had a fair share of good moments in the movieoverall barbie is a fairly okay movie but honestly it doesnt live up to the hype,0.9936,positive

811,irnbondar,22-Jul-23,the movie did some real weird worldbuilding where none of the rules were consistent i had to keep reminding myself that barbieland was made by men therefore barbieland is not an exact opposite of the real world  its a rendering of what men think female utopia is but it wasnt a direct opposite of real world either i doubt many viewers will actually be able to internalize that as part of the lorethe parallel between realworld and barbieland just didnt make sense therefore it felt like a plot fail if barbies are all important unlike women in the real world where does ken swooning over barbie land on on that real world spectrumim just going to say the fact that barbie has 0 complex feelings until the lady from the real world played with her but ken was aware of being unhappy while being not a person but an accessory to barbie is the kind of double crossing i didnt expect i was confused about which point it tried provingryan gosling has a real chance to become an icon for incels after this performance he gets rejected creates an ultramasculine society and at the end barbie apologises to him and he rebrands he was a villain and did not get a redemption arc he shouldnt even be sentient in this universe as much as he is i expected barbie to be honest with him and say she just doesnt love him or that she wasnt made to have those feelings to him because matell did not give her those feelings instead she apologises for not giving him more attentionanyways it wasnt feminist enough for me it felt like it avoided some major issues of real life like the phrase we just learned how to hide it better that did not get addressed whatsoever like the barbies now know that women dont have it as great as them in the real world how does that solve anythingmaybe i am just reading too deep into a movie with flawed worldbuilding made for people who dont generally see the gender bias around them4 for some funny jokes but it could be funnier,0.8606,positive

821,kmataftsi,11-Aug-23,i dont understand all the hype around this movie i found it boring with almost no plot it had a few fun moments nothing too funny i dont think i ever laughed throughout the whole movie a great performance from ryan gosling indeed although margot robbie was perhaps mediocre he definitely stole the thunder regarding patriarchy and feminism it merely scratched the surface of those terms it was perhaps more of a simulation of how an elementary teacher would explain patriarchy to kids it doesnt offer anything to adults except for if they lived in a cave and never heard about patriarchy,0.817,positive
822,rosopuco,15-Aug-23,i enjoy the time watching this because the details are there and represent a lot the experience we all live in our time besides the work of ryan and margot in this movie conveys a higher level of feeling a feeling you cant describe you feel the conection between them and you it really argues about feelings and social deconstruction and in the work doesnt show a treat any of the genders superior to others in reality there is a dependency between genders that is easily evidenced talks about the importance of knowing how to value oneself as a person and it is evidenced in the relationship between barbie margot and ken ryan in which ken has a dependency on barbie in which he cannot exist without her which is reflected in our society,0.8705,positive

834,rachaelparker-45170,23-Jul-23,i had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release however for me thats as good as it got brilliant marketing the first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just werent that touching i can see what they were trying to do with girlpower but i found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to put ken back in his place which i get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if youre trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power i would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real dream world looks like the speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film at least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through,0.9658,positive
835,milaradovanovic-65373,3-Sep-23,this movie moved me deeply i am a 20yearold girl and to finally see a movie that deals with gender inequality and patriarchy in such an intelligent way was something i really did not expect very satisfied hearing and seeing an acknowledgement of our current situation as a society was absolutely necessary during several scenes of the film i literally had tears in my eyes because i finally felt understood the message in my opinion is clearly expressed it is up to the viewer to perceive it anyone who thinks that the ending expresses the superiority of barbies over ken is missing the point they are completely off the mark not only womens issues are shown in the movie but also mens issues i highly recommend viewing also for men without prejudice and with the will to understand nothing more to add a masterpiece that deals with very topical social issues that we needed thank you barbie,0.9576,positive
836,denisnichita,23-Jul-23,the movie starts off well with a surprisingly clever and colorful depiction of barbies world she drinks out of empty cups showers under a waterless shower can fly around as if transported by a hand just a like a real doll house at some point barbie starts becoming a real woman by thinking about death having cellulite and her feet flatten out she goes into the real world to find the girl that broke the spacetime continuum and started to make her realall this time we see lots of barbies all of them named barbie that have advanced degrees are racially diverse with different body types even the kens are brainless bodybuilders who dont have any occupation other than being pretty and overly infatuated with the barbies ryan gosling does an excellent job and portrays ken perfectly which was surprising to me definitely an oscar performance for the actor also margot robbie is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking across the whole movie a true real life barbie doll who also plays the part perfectly we also have basically half the cast of sex education and lots of references to other movies like the matrix pinocchio and maybe others which i havent observedthis being said the problems start to pile up now cause all of the above is just a superficial sugar coating for the real reason of the movie gender theory propaganda the world is reduced to the patriarchy when barbie and ken go to the real world barbie feels objectified and powerless and ken starts understanding the patriarchy while the real world is a true patriarchy the barbie world is a true matriarchy long story short ken goes back to the barbie world establishes the patriarchy there and then barbie and her owner go back to the barbie world and reestablish the matriarchy the movie is blunt and frankly disappointing in its portrayal of men and women men are nothing women are everything men portrayed through ken dont have meaning and are not supposed to have meaning in life they just exist to be beaching and simp over barbies women on the other hand are everything lawyers teachers senators presidents phds scientists etci dare the audience to think of the barbie movie in reverse women are nothing and men are everything that would be an outrageous movies and the directors would be down right cancelledthe movie does not present the true condition of being a woman today but it just hates on men and wants them crushed and powerless in a sort of historical revenge it reduced the world and the complex social dynamics between men and women to patriarchy the movie its divisive destructive and does not solve any problems i honestly felt like i was in an orwell novel its a pitty because the set was very good and had a lot of potential for something deep and meaningful something that could have brought men and women together as a team but instead it resorted to sjw woke extreme left ideology and apparently the audience was brainlessly having it,0.9024,positive

848,keesjansenhifi,7-Sep-23,i recently watched this movie with my daughter i expected a nice movie but the story is lousy and i thought it was not funny i think the movie should be fine for my niece of 9 years old but for me i did not understand what the fuss was about it was predictable bad story the begin started simple and when whe went to the real world there was so much more that could have been done but instead the story if very simple and no depth well maybe i am just to old for it hahai am sure there will be a barbie 2 and 3 as long as they make money from it even my 17 year old daughter did not like it and thought it was a childrens movie,-0.9397,negative
849,teresa_wray,23-Jul-23,about reality none of the nonsense of ask the barbie movies in all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human it was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys it would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understandi told my human it was pretty much rocky horror picture show without the sexuality and way more pink not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time if it wasnt so new then i would do an episode on my podcast about it,0.9101,positive
850,lypasm,24-Jul-23,barbie movie had superb casting writing acting and plot twists it was a surprisingly cerebral movie with a poignant message on the perils of patriarchy in the real world and the exclusion of men in the barbie land at its heart barbie is a movie about selfdiscovery the movie is much more insightful than i expected and takes a deep dive into the perils of minimizing the humanity of women and men be it in barbie land or the real worldbarbie movie has some plot twists and it challenges stereotypes and preconceived notions of the roles of men and women in society barbie doesnt want to be put in a box in the real world and ken wants to have value and a meaningfully existence in barbie land,0.8952,positive
851,stuartroberts-61491,23-Jul-23,barbie 2023barbie 2023 is a clever political comedy instilled with scenes of artfullyemployed and oftentouching drama and rife with thinly albeit comedically veiled commentaries on the woes and whims of patriarchal society neofeminism republicanism and surprisingly given the films main overarching themes democrat beliefs at a runtime of 1h 54m the film was fantastic i thoroughly enjoyed my viewing particularly due to the performances of one of the strongest casts ive seen in any film released this year with robbie as barbie gosling as beach ken ferrel my favourite performance of the movie as the mattel ceo mckinnon as weird barbie and cera as alan amongst others serving the films witty multifaceted writing well each person felt perfect for their role and i dont personally think it could have been cast any better it was perfectspoilers from here on outthe story is simple but well executed and easily palatable for a range of ages largely in thanks to the nearscintillating writing of gerwig and baumbach and the clever concealment of political messages such that they either fit in well with the story and serve pivotally to the plot ken introducing the patriarchy to the other kens in barbie land or as it becomes kendom or are placed into a scene in which they cause no hindrance or clunkiness and simply convey a message ferrels character much like his president business in the lego movie wears an outfit analogous to that of donald trump and kens whole newlyinstated patriarchy is certainly designed to mimic many republican beliefs along with perpetuating stereotypes like gorging on beers by day and engaging in superficial traditionalisms horses the comedy is by all accounts really funny multiple gags persist throughout like the discontinuation of pregnant barbie the lack of genitalia on barbies and kens weird barbie mckinnon and the callowness of the mattel executives there are great oneoff jokes too and many are clearly intended to cater towards adults as well as children like when barbie sees a billboard for the miss universe beauty pageant on the venice boardwalk coming to the conclusion that they must be the supreme court most political entities are conventionally attractive females in barbie land depressed barbie along with other barbies playing off bodyimage stereotypes and a surprising innuendo spoken by ferrels character in which with no real context he refers to the mattel hq as a long phallic building overall the film is very funny and knows when to and when not to employ comedy in a scene for the best effectthe pacing is tight for the first half and it manages to maintain good overall pace throughout slowing slightly towards the end but still moving along nicely up until the credits rollnow the characters i cant lie there is not a lot to say and thats not a bad thing each performance is marvellous thanks largely in part to great casting but for me the characters didnt evolve all that much over the films runtime sure barbie ends up a human and gains genitalia somehow implied by the final scene ken becomes slightly more selfaware i guess the mattel execs just sortof sway freely between barbieperpetuated matriarchyproponents and selfabsorbed blatant sexists and weird barbie becomes deostracized but apart from that the rest serve as vessels for the films message simple and entertaining but devoid of complexity one character alan played by cera did catch my attention though ill talk about him more in my criticisms down below another great thing i noticed was the movies drama i was actually surprised prior to watching when i read via google that its genres were comedydrama and upon watching was pleasantly surprised the film includes a few rather touching scenes satisfying enough not to dull the tone but serious enough to have impact on the viewer and arent plagued by cringy music nor excessive jokes they are raw by all accounts one such scene features barbie sat on a public bench shortly after realising that the world is not a matriarchal haven like barbie land as she cries in a cowgirloutfit noless she notices an older woman sat across from her and tearily declares her beautiful playing on the films themes of existence ageing and impending mortality it serves as the heart of the movie and was onpar with something one may expect to find in a more serious drama another includes barbies meeting with ruth handlers ghost in the mattel headoffice which is later complimented by another which is laden with innocuous jokes about ruths taxevasion scandals and holds a more comedic tonenow earlier i praised the films use of veiled political undertones but i also believe there were some that didnt quite work firstly i am not sure what message the film was actually pedalling it certainly wasnt feminism as many seem to think sure many scenes involve strong women demonized men we dont all catcall sexually harass or otherwise dominate women in our daily lives and a somewhat functional matriarchy only functional for the women but the film also seems pretty critical of neofeminist beliefs and ideals it quite blatantly criticises the matriarchy in that all of the men are oppressed and exist only to fawn over the women who dont want them and shows that nonconventional barbies weird barbie are ostracized and bullied for deformities which they cant help though it also criticises the patriarchy in that nearly every man in the movie sexually objectifies women to the degree of fetishising them by putting them in skimpy maid outfits the women that support the patriarchy are all brainwashed and must be reprogrammed in order to have them rebel and that the patriarchs are all somewhat stupid or callow what was the aimelsewise the republicans are certainly minced throughout donald trump symbology criticism of traditionalist ideals and the emphasis on castdiversity certainly sees to this the cast has multiple black people latinamericans and a lesbian in kate mckinnon amongst other represented minorities though the character i mentioned earlier alan seems to criticise those who are democrats leftwing works in that he is ostracized by the kens largely ignored by the barbies and seeks to escape stating that noone will care if an alan gets into the real world he is one of those no other character likes them characters and overall manages to throw the films message into disarray there is no steadfast discernable message as far as i can see and all agendae are both furthered and criticised with none that stick as in the end barbie land is still ruled matriarchally and the kens are still held in lower esteem by the barbies though the real world is unchanged and mattel shows no signs of incorporating female leadership furthermore the kens never seem to gain any purpose which was their whole goal as far as i can tell they get no dreamhouses no equality no horses no jobs and no love 3 this didnt ruin the film for me by any means and i still herald it as the best one ive watched this year so far i am to watch oppenheimer soon but it does make me wonder what gerwig and baumbach really had in mindoverall the film was great and i would recommend it for all as long as they can take a joke dont hate women dont hate men and arent perturbed by politics it is witty fun touching and hilarious sated with fantastic performances and easily palatable characters i give this film an 810 and will definitely watch it again,0.9996,positive

856,jaimeematheson,23-Jul-23,i expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones it ended up being insanely funny ridiculous fun and stupidly entertaining yet highly topical and commentative this movie hit on so many topics patriarchy capitalism feminism even misandry yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout it never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations the only reason i dont give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavyhanded and i can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message other than that this is the best movie ive seen in years and i cant see any topping it any time soon,0.9117,positive

863,collectionofatoms,31-Jul-23,i never would have gone to see this movie if it werent for a friend showing up to a party and telling me that it was a masterpiece she described it as high art which to me is high praise after seeing it i agree it has all of the qualities of high art in that it is bound to be confusing to some interpreted differently and will inspire great feelings positive and negative depending on the viewerbarbie gives you every opportunity to come in thinking you will be getting the silly quirky female equivalent of the marvel universe vapid problems absurdity boys and a classical formulaic movie arc and it some ways it does keep to thatbut all of those things are overshadowed by the philosophical discussion taking place the director shows two worlds in juxtaposition the barbie universe and the real world in present day matriarchy and patriarchyby removing a sense of consequence from the lives and decisions of the characters from the barbie universe it instead is able to engage on the philosophical level a good comparison is the good place characters dont have to act or respond realistically instead characters respond thoughtfully and in accordance with the philosophical archetypes they representthe barbie universe is made to be perfect for the women that run that society the kens are riddled with need for validation they hold no power of their own and barbies have no incentive to share itthrough some plot vehicles barbie and ken come to the real world in one of the most important scenes of the film barbie and ken walk down venice beach arriving from their strange plastic universe for the first time the ultimately empowered barbie is ogled and catcalled and made to feel unsafe and the ultimately disempowered ken is made to feel respected just for being alivei think this specific scene is really important because its at the center of understanding the context for modern feminism the simple difference between navigating walking down the street as a woman vs a man our world feels qualitatively different depending on who we are our feelings of safety and security in the public can differ wildly depending on what body we inhabitcheekily the film is made for the female gaze all men in the film are shown as being vapid and thoughtless both in the barbie universe and the real world i feel that this was an intentional decision to cause feelings of discomfort in men that watch it serves to both flip the standard movie script that has been improving in recent years where it has been normal for female characters to be accessories to a plot and eyecandy for the male viewer and not ends in themselves and also to make similarities between male viewers and ken sting a bit as a male viewer and musician i felt a painful twinge when ken says let me play music at you it caused me to wonder how much space i take up socially with my music and aware of how playing music when its not expressly desired can have a way of shutting down vulnerable conversation similarly the depictions of male to male empowerment felt familiar caricatures with a grain of truth to themas the conflict ends and barbie world returns to matriarchy the film ends on a thoughtful tone in both worlds the subjugated sex needs to fight for power being ungenerously allotted to them by the ruling sex with a clear message that nobody wants either of these worlds that in discarding the feelings of the unempowered denizens of our world we create a weak foundation that true acceptance and understanding of these issues comes from letting in our full mortal nature and the realities that come with being human that being messy complex and sexual beings is what gives meaning to this world and what is called for in any conversation on equality and class disparitydespite our expectations barbie isnt dumb it reflects a lot of thought and understanding of the current moment it uses archetypes and simple forms to discuss real issues in the zeitgeist today it discusses the problems with barbie as a brand with some formulations of feminism with patriarchical society and what is does to womens understandings of themselvesbarbie represents an awareness that far surpasses anybodys expectations of the intellectual property it represents and is worth the uncomfortable and somewhat depressing nature of the film for the dialog it opens up,0.9909,positive
864,louis-20683,20-Aug-23,the discussion surrounding the barbie movie has generated varying viewpoints with some reviewers suggesting that the film is critical of men portraying them as weak and insecure however upon closer examination it becomes evident that the movie offers a sophisticated commentary on broader societal dynamics encompassing power dynamics oppression and gender rolesto begin with the movie underscores that patriarchy as a structural framework doesnt uniformly favour all men this is exemplified by ken whose lack of opportunities becomes apparent in the context of the real world contrary to the idea that patriarchy inherently benefits all men the film sheds light on how this system works to elevates those who already have wealth and authority within society in essence it unveils that a genuine world where patriarchy benefits all men albeit an unlikely scenario could only exist in a world where conventional rules and responsibilities dont exist barbieland while simultaneously presenting us with an already failing matriarchy that oppresses mena key theme that emerges is the portrayal of oppression as a learned behaviour kens exploration into patriarchy serves as a catalyst for his evolution the display of toxic masculinity he develops is rooted in the adoption of traits he observes in an attempt to gain respect and power it becomes clear however that this faade doesnt genuinely resonate with him as a person in the final moments of the movie ken rejects the ideas and behaviours he initially believed to be powerful realising that they neither align with who he is as a person or make him feel fulfilled this underscores how societal expectations often make men feel pressured into conforming to behaviours within a system that in reality fails to serve their genuine intereststhere is a clear narrative in the last 20 minutes of the movie to show that most men while being aware of patriarchy arent actively trying to oppress women which is really clear when ken says he thought it was just about riding horses this highlights how many men while aware of patriarchy dont actively try to oppress women instead sticking to the status quo comes from a fear of challenging the existing power structures out of fear of losing power or falling into the same state of oppression they were forcing on womenultimately the core message of the movie is to advocate for an equitable world that doesnt support the dominance of men or women the film suggests that power does not need be gained through oppression instead it shows that the best solution lies in an world where everyone has equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations this is symbolised by kens transformation into an authentic version of himself shedding the confines of the beach ken stereotype similarly stereotypical barbie is portrayed as lacking resonance with genuine womanhood in essence the film advocates for a world where individuality flourishes irrespective of gender and where empowerment is rooted in authenticity rather than conforming to the roles society puts on usto summarise the barbie movie is more than its surface interpretations and works to show an exploration of power dynamics oppression and societal roles its portrayal of characters and their transformations serves as a mirror to the complexity of realworld issues ultimately advocating for a society where real empowerment stems from embracing individuality and fostering equal opportunities for allto people who think the barbie movie casts a negative light on men and depicts them as weak its important to recognise that the films intention is not to generalise or demean masculinity just as much as it works to dismantle toxic elements of femininity while certain aspects of the movie might seem critical of traditional gender roles its deeper message speaks the complexities of power dynamics and societal expectations that affect everyone the movies portrayal of characters like ken undergoing transformation and introspection is not about condemning masculinity but rather an exploration of the pressures society places on individuals to conform to predefined roles by engaging with the film in this broader context it becomes evident that it aims to foster understanding and empathy rather than to vilify masculinity as a whole,0.6558,positive

866,penguinmizeravi,11-Aug-23,the barbie movie interested me at first i wasnt expecting anything more than a silly movie with an interesting message maybe it couldve been a great way to show people the struggles of women in modern society however this movie really disappointshonestly i was enjoying this picture very much around the first act some jokes were landing it was silly but it seemed to have no wish of making a statement barbieland seemed very far from reality and thats what made it funny ken getting flown by the waves in the most unnatural way just because he wants to prove himself also his job is beach i found that very funnyhowever i was expecting the real world to be a turning point in the movie if the real world actually seemed tonally different from barbieland or even seem real in any way characters like will ferrells ceo of mattel and the employees just make the real world feel as silly and dumb as barbieland though will ferrell is hilarious in this moviehowever i would let that one slide if it wasnt for other characters that feel dumb and just dumb not funny like sasha who is a completely useless character that was introduced as this mean depressed teenager that wants to harm everyone for no reason however she never again is presented this way somehow she is a nice girl later in the movie and even defends her mom in the rare instances of her actually saying something in the second to third act of the movie her mom though has a more important role however she is one of the big elements that ruin this movie her speech near the end of the second act feels like shes stating the obvious and not really making a difference however for some reason everyone buys it and barbie no longer has depression it looks like greta has no clue how to express depression on screenbarbie tries to create emotional moments in a couple of scenes and in the very ending which feel totally out of tone as i feel like margots character really doesnt have much depth and these scenes are dropped in the worst times and are not impactful it looks like greta has no clue how to express depression on screen as some moments that couldve been sad are treated as jokeswhen ken figures out about patriarchy and goes back to barbieland is where this movie shows what its true message is the kens end up ruling barbieland and all the barbies get mindcontrolled except for margot but then the day is saved as all the barbies take control of barbieland once again and the kens remain with no power whatsoever i see this as gretas moment of telling the audience that this movie is not for men or she just truly believes men should shut up and let women do what they will as equality truly is never a goal in this movieas the narrator says one day the kens will have the same rights as women in the real world i noticed the hatred coming along if barbieland symbolizes something it would be an utopia the perfect society however instead of solving the problem of this utopia by giving power to kens and creating a true perfect balance it comes back to statusquo by keeping kens powerless showing gretas real wish here i feel its a huge mistake as the movie brings up the topic of change halfway through while not making a good example contradicting its own morals if they were correct in the first placebarbies character arc is not bad but its poorly executed it seems like its all over the place and the writers didnt know how to develop her sometimes she is annoying oftentimes she is dumb but mostly her arc is based on her depression and how she feels though we dont really feel like her and i get confused on how the depressed doll thing works im really confused as no other depressed person ever played with a doll before it seems like children are seen as dull and have no emotions that matter because if the dolls reflect their personality then they would be dumb and never question reality as the barbies and kens do but barbie is the only one that does and this is why she turns into a human in the end its not a very emotional ending it feels overly dramatic as the topics being covered and the tone of the movie doesnt build up to this moment but barbie now living in the real world is fine it just isnt anything specialoverall this movie instigates hatred and is doing this at this very moment in real life the polarizing nature of this movie is clear here its lack of selfdoubt and the need of proving itself correctly while not being right whatsoever makes us who didnt enjoy the movie turn into the villains as our opinion becomes irrelevant and can be refuted with simply i bet your favorite movie is the godfather im not trying to pick any side as im just giving my opinion i respect all opinions and expect people to do the samethis movie could be fine in its own right if it wasnt for the toxic and sheer irrational nature that it generates which is a reflection of our society and the hatred we keep inside and often only let it out in movies such as this one though im looking forward to more new ideas like this one as the industry is starting to come back with inventive and creative pictures that bring people to the cinema and generate revenue just hoping to be better movies next time barbie2023 310,-0.9931,negative

871,jaegrayson,7-Aug-23,first let me say there are some laughs in this movie and i enjoyed some of the comedy absolutely fun for kids and family minus the sexual innuendos and sexual jokes honestly i believe this movie is making money cus of the brand alone visually this movie is appealing yes absolutely straight out of the toy stores and out of the barbie toy boxes story wise this movie is a dump mediocre at best feminist heavy which is fine but the story itself is what makes it a dump it makes no sense if youre expecting a lego movie or free guy type of reveal there is not one the humans literally just cross over to barbieland and barbie herself is able to stay in the human world which is apparently a skip and a jump away from the city this makes the movie seem like its disney channel material and not really disney theater material its a barbie movie so i wasnt expecting much but to not explain why and how everyone is able to just crossover to barbieland is bad writing the main character draws a sad barbie and it makes barbie in the nearby very real barbieland sad barbie can somehow feel her emotions so with no explanation why barbie is supposed to be a doll but is also real and has a connection to this woman whos works for mattel and draws barbie in her free time mattel ceos can also crossover to barbieland and its normal this side of the story is terrible aside from the obvious feminist storyline there is no other story that makes sense its all just disney channel silliness the final scene serves no purpose other than to serve for another inside sexual joke so dumbthe oscar talk surrounding this movie is absurd as a real movie its a terrible movie while gosling is funny here should he be nominated for playing a silly sad ken doll literally anyone could have played these roles there was nothing oscar worthy in these performances gosling has turned in some great performances in his career but this is just not one of them nominating him would be equivalent to nominating kurt russell for his role in sky high nothing outstandingof course women and little girls will find this movie entertaining thanks to nostalgia and the visually appealing sets it will connect with most females is it really oscar worthy id say no there is no real acting done in this movie nominating this movie for anything other than visual costumes andor sets would be an insult to the actors that have truly acted in some amazing rolesshould you watch this movie sure why not like i said its visually appealing and is funny and is feminist heavy most women should and will most likely enjoy this movie anyone with a sense of story telling might not i would suggest watching free guy and the lego movie much better stories being told there that actually do make sense,0.9811,positive
872,MovieWatcher22,7-Aug-23,i had high expectations as a result of the media press however these were crushed from the startfirst of all i did expect it to feel a little generic and cheesy although all i could feel throughout the movie is that it was rushed and cheap the storyline was dry and overpoliticalid have liked to see more lgbtq representation and breaking stereotypes as it felt like just a generic film even the barbies were considered stereotypescomedy throughout was limited and wasnt engaging at all  sometimes trying too hard to emphasise feminism and going too far in the opposite direction to the world is heading in im not encouraging patriarchyhowever i did find the music quite good especially the billie eilish song and did redeem the movie a little bitin summary the movie was mediocre at best and theres not much to discuss it felt like a cheap version of movies like spirited and the greatest showman with no real emotion,0.9198,positive
873,christinalishal,22-Jul-23,this movie was everything that was expected of it it was funny feministic cute beautiful and everything plastic it was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie but it surprised us this movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in todays society and in the patriarchal world we live in today it also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements the only thing that brought this film down from a 1010 was that it was everything we expected and was missing a surprising plot twist all in all i really recommend to watch this movie it was a wonderful experience in the cinema,0.9529,positive
874,cssledge-86415,21-Jul-23,i really enjoyed the satirical approach that was employed in barbie it poked fun at barbie world but also delivers a message of empowerment and individuality i laughed and was throughly entertained its a great movie for mothers and their tween teen or adult daughtersi would recommend this movie to anyone that played with barbies and kens it explored and poked fun at all aspects of the barbie universe mattel barbies perfect life and appreance barbies many professions kens dependency on barbie patriarchy feminism barbie and kens clothes their houses cars their fake food pools water beaches what happens to dolls that get mistreated its a great movie well done,0.9903,positive
875,pdcqsq,21-Jul-23,while there were definitely some funny parts they were too few to outweigh the other annoyingly cheesy jokes thrown around the actors seemed a bit on the older side but the overall movie did not appear to be an adult movie i feel that it tried to find a balance for kids and adults but in the end fell short for both some bits were too long for my taste and the plot seemed to go back and forth too much between the barbie and the real world i did not have high expectations but what did help me watch through the movie were the strong messages for our generation that were heartfelt and genuine,0.952,positive
876,kristenfisher-27865,26-Sep-23,such a great movie with a meaningful plot line have seen it 3x in theaters i love margot and i love america they are my two favorite characters in the movie this movie has funny points tied with classic barbie nostalgia and a story that gives words to the thoughts and feelings of millions of women around the globe i laughed and i cried watching this movie and i could not recommend it more i didnt know how a movie would go with most of the characters sharing a name barbie  ken but i dont think it negatively reflects on the movie at allthey really made it work together well that is all,0.9266,positive

880,alwinsup,8-Aug-23,went yesterday to the movie theaters to saw barbie after i read a lot of positive reviews however it was not my cup of tea i saw sometimes a funny moment most of the time because of will ferrell but the other jokes were a bit cringe i guess the target audience is focused on woman instead of men in my theater the woman had a laugh and the men kinda waited for it to endwhat else i dont know margot and ryan gave their best and they did pretty alrightthe big message that the movie wanted to bring over was a bit long over explained i am not sure i understood it in the end also was not sure i even bothered to give it any thinkingin the end i just wanted to go home,0.9602,positive

882,thongman,22-Jul-23,the only reason this movie even gets a 2 from me is because margot robbie is a beautiful woman its 2 hours of my life i will never get back a waste of money to see will ferrell plays his usual ridiculous self as all of his roles ryan gosling also has a role that is beneath him margot robbie is a great actress and so much more capable than this role a definite dont see this movie it should have an age rating no one over the age of eight years old allowed unless accompanied by a toddler yes it was that bad an embarrassment to all who acted in this movie the writers should be ashamed this may be all that hollywood is capable of during a writers strike hopefully there will not be a sequel to this god awful movie i only saw it because my wife wanted to see it for some strange reason i would have to say its the worst movie i have ever paid to see hands down so not waste your time or your money to go to this movie wait for it to go to video it shouldnt take long,0.2125,positive
883,alfiegriffiths-35249,23-Jul-23,very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down but overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film i enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but thats not to say the scenes in the real world werent enjoyable it wasnt what i expected it to be in a good way it clearly didnt have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable i loved watching how barbie and ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she cant do in barbie land like drinking,0.9942,positive
884,ceuamadora,24-Jul-23,because of some reviews i thought that the movie was bad and innapropriate but when i saw it i got shocked with the important and deep subjects that the movie talked about and at the same time i enjoyed the way that they talked about those sensitive subjects i liked the way that they the movie had sad partes but that were funny and i liked the way that even when things were serious they put them in an hilarious wayi enjoyed the end because it ended up well to ken and to barbie and everyone got happyi hope that ken finds his person and i would really like a continuation of this movie,0.9804,positive
885,clarkey_me,24-Jul-23,wasnt sure how it would go however so much funnier then i expected and definitely more of an adult film then i expected too thought it was going to be aimed at the barbie loving 4 year olds however lots of laughs throughout both jokes and other little subtle jokes like the ceo with his pink drum sticks and not being able to get through the locked gate with his swipe card as barbie hops over the top and loved how it flipped between barbie world and the normal world would highly recommend and would totally go back and see again and buy once out loved how everyone also gets in barbie theme and go dressed in pink,0.9802,positive
886,japortilloduran,10-Aug-23,i thought the plot would be very good for what it seemed in the trailer but it was very boring with certain funny scenes also the ideal would have been for the kens to be united to be equal in their world not to leave them underneath as always and making them look like idiots which is supposed to be the concept that wanted to be eradicated i feel that the performances were very forced except for kate mckinnon and america ferrerathe movie tried to give a good message but it really ended up being very confusing i expected a comedy more than a movie trying to be existential,0.9534,positive
887,leifage,26-Aug-23,im one of those but i have many others in my life who i work with and live with and so it was great to view the world through their eyes for a couple hours and get my head around issues that impact them it was a funny and entertaining movie just go to it aware that theres quite a bit of sociological dialogue america ferreras soliloquy in the middle of the movie was powerful and would have been imo more powerful if it hadnt been surrounded by so many others like it before and after but the issues are complex and could not possibly be covered by just one scene so thats understandable it feels good to be heard and theres a lot to hear here but nothing for men to fear the one thing i did not like was when one male character admitted that we men do a better job hiding the patriarchy in modern times cmon has there been progress or not that statement creates distrust and erases good will theres been progress yay we need more progress okay lets go,0.9926,positive
888,prbismal,23-Jul-23,initially i wasnt so sure about how this movie would be and whether it would overly focus on the idea of a barbie doll stopping it from extending to a resonant deep meaning however i was quickly proven wromg as we see the procession of barbies life going from perfect to realistic showing us that we really are similar makimg the movie much more pleasurable in my eyes and allowimg us to connect with her them going to the human world and ken going back with new ideas further related the movie to the real world as we felt some level of pity for ken as he had been forced to feel this way for so long but also felt anger and confuaion as to why he was ruining this perfecr world woth clearly dysfunctional ideas given that he knew how it felt the ending was very satisfying as it brought closure to the topic at hand and also taught audiences a true lesson about society and the world generally elevating it from a simple childish movie without sacrificing the barbie feel with the various sprinkles whimsical and funny moments which acted as a reset for the tone without causing you to forget what had happened a very good movie with a strong well delivered message,0.9721,positive
889,xxdenkxx,25-Jul-23,well barbie 2023 movie actually out of my expectation i know barbie always been supporting feminist but this time barbie movie showing us how being feminist without even makes men feels underestimated so the whole plot was perfectly wrapped by good spices and wellwrittenand im so happy miss gretta had chosen margot robbie as barbie her face and body just like living barbie despite on that we understand that barbie always been so perfect but in this movie barbie was written as just like us and margot perfectly suit into this character also ryan gosling as ken his character is so funny and i really enjoyed it,0.9938,positive
890,brunajorge-17359,27-Sep-23,the movie shows the power of women and men values equality and shows how patriotism is harmful for both men and women as it creates unfair opportunities and toxic stereotypes such as sexism and how you should be as a men people should pay attention to the movie as it can be easily misunderstood and not taken in the right way some people might say that it makes out men to be less valued than women however it used a metaphor to show how unfair the world really is  as women in reality are still considered less valuable this movie does not support sexism and it helps both genders to realize they can be whoever they are and they are enough,0.6763,positive
891,RubyMouse,8-Aug-23,as a woman and a feminist i was disappointed by this the actors were great  margot and ryan doing their best  but they can only work what theyre given and the story was wafer thin and made no sense this would have been ok if it was a movie aimed at kids but it wasnt and i would imagine children would be bored even quicker than i was its lovely to look at the clothes and sets replicating the barbie world so beautifully but its very much style over substance and the jokes are laboured and repetitive if it was just a lighthearted giggle for the girls i would have enjoyed it more but the second half is full of dreary speeches and millisecond cameos rob brydon that added nothing but a nod to the cleverness of the directors research skills,0.9737,positive
892,rnucci,1-Aug-23,i agree that the film is contrary to the feminist narrative so much so that in barbieland women rule everything and barbie didnt want to stay there at the end of the movie preferring real life the men of barbilndia built by women were useless and bananas without an i this is dealt with in one of the final scenesi thought the film brought up very deep reflections that people didnt understand according to the film the world of patriarchy is imperfect and so is the feminist worldthe scenes of ken declaring himself to barbie are reminiscent of poets and their muses at no point does he make an apology for ideologythe film is intelligent with impeccable performances,-0.2076,negative
893,kirbyirish-78535,22-Jul-23,had so much more potential this script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel although margot robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well its not enough to carry this movie alone ryan gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment especially during the first half of the film not the worst movie of the year but not the best of its release week eitheroverall feeling is gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point i am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs ultimately they tried to be a little too deep muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way,-0.3894,negative
894,latifasnyh,26-Jul-23,the barbie movie changed my life it really flipped a switch in my brain that men do really just want girls  nothing more and you are worth more than that you are all that and a mans validation does not have to tell you so theyre right barbie is everything and ken is just ken  who knew after everything everyone told me im worth more than i know the barbie movie is what did it i love this moviealthough i did expect the ending to be a rather more happy one i dont know why but i imagined an ending where they were dancing just like the start of the movie wouldve been so great i loved that scene and since its audience is more likely children i visioned an alternate ending to the movie as it wouldve been a little easier for them to comprehend but as a young adult i completely love the movie all of the actors did a perfect job as their characters last but not least i did almost manage to shed a tear  but i held it in because my mum was there haha,0.9928,positive

896,drawdycole,23-Jul-23,"in a fun visually stunning simplistic way barbie captures the audience with nostalgia and bright color schemes with a plethora of barbie styles versions and callouts to real accessories barbie proves to peak the interest of the audience and bring humor with short quips and comments by the characters and narrator it has a strong opening that establishes the makebelieve world and sets a quick witted tone to the movie mixing slap stick comedy with deeper philosophical undertoneshowever after establishing main character
barbie and sidekick ken characters well and showing a clear direction in the first quarter of the film humor is exchanged for harsh reality in the second quarter with no real relief or solution given to the audience as the movie moves into the third quarter mixed messaging seems to have feminist roots but fails to address real issues for the common moderate feminist there are several chances in the film in which the main character barbie can and does acknowledge the imbalance between men and women but fails to provide a bonding peaceful solution to the imbalance furthermore it doubles down on the more radical one sided views of modern feminism aiming to make one gender men incompetent while promoting the other gender women as the best leadership solution for a competently run balanced society at one point a main character other than barbie has a minutes long soliloquy outlining all the troubles of women today yet solutions are never presented and the end result feels more like complaining than empowermentthe last fourth of the movie seems to complete the fall away from the light heartedness of the opening which was actually one of the strengths and expectations of the film slap stick awkward one liner comedy remains throughout but while watching the audiences confusion about the message only allows for chuckles instead of all out laughs some comedy ends up falling flat from obvious missed payoffs or opportunities to instill the uniting of genders as a solution instead the film awkwardly seems to support the notion that one sided governance is acceptable as long as it is the side that the writers deem proper in this case it is clearly women but almost coldly so as if leaving out the core feminist movement completely if barbie was meant to leave the audience with a feeling of hope for the future it certainly missed the mark onthenose propaganda was not what the audience came to see but is what they received regardless of how humorous any scene attempted to bethe best aspect of the movie are convincing performances by margot robbie and ryan gosling robbies portrayal of barbie is well over shadowed or more accurately over powered by goslings ken unfortunately the character arc for barbie was completed but underwhelming while the character arc for ken was expansive but confusing both characters seemed to miss the moral growth mark leaving the audience wondering if any lessons had been learned at allin summary strong visual presence humor and performances kept this film from being a total flop due to the over exaggerated and misguided social commentary forced on the viewer what should have been a light hearted fun uniting feelgood film was indeed a well put together visually stunning mildly funny piece of propaganda for mattel playing dress up in a modern feminist costume that only a barbie doll could get away with",0.9969,positive

906,paulineseince,7-Aug-23,the movie started well then missed a perfect chance of a beautiful empathetic endingi was expecting that once barbie visited the real world she would understand how ken felt in her world decide that no superiority should be instigated neither in a sense nor in another and hence come best with a better plan of equality to show the lead for a better world which would have been a perfect message modern women would givebut here we got zero empathy for ken rather a plan to manipulate men and empower them back thats the pointim honestly surprised they get away with such an ending,0.9813,positive
907,kendylshamblen,26-Sep-23,i loved this movie i wasnt sure what to expect when i went to go view it but i was not disappointed lots of meaning in this movie that relate to the real world i feel as if many critics didnt pay enough attention to see the meanings even simple things and small scenes or scenes that seemed silly and meaningless had meaning i loved the inclusion of real classic barbies as well as discontinued and banned ones tons of nostalgia throughout for those who grew up and had barbies themselves my one thing is that the movie was supposed to be for everyone but i feel for younger children they wouldnt understand a lot of the movie i feel like some could be explained and be a good teaching lesson but overall more of a young adult movie otherwise was great and a powerful moving movie,0.967,positive
908,mjquinonez,5-Oct-23,barbie live actionbarbie live action stars margot robbie ryan gosling and directed by greta gerwig it premiered this year and tells us the dynamics of the imaginary world of barbies and kens with the gender roles reversed in this pink worldwhen she was younger she loved barbie i became involved in that fantasy world created by a woman without losing everything that characterized femininity through her appearance her characteristic outfits her makeup and the multifaceted talents she had added to this barbie crossed that cinematic world and it was possible for us to build our own identity through a doll all these characteristics and more were accompanied by her identifying phrase you can be whatever you want to be for this reason barbie was and is an icon in the childhood of many however not everything is rosy in the world of barbie and the live action of the film shows us thisthe film transports us to this imaginary world that we all created and that we were finally able to see in reality i love the satire that accompanies this film about how mattel the company that created the doll is made up of men who according to them recognize the needs and demands of girls barbie also shows us that these demands are diverse and that each girl creates a different world with each doll she uses this is how we meet the president barbie the physicist the diplomat the doctor the writer and many others but finally it focuses on the stereotypical barbiethrough stereotypical barbie we feel involved in the complexities of the female stereotype identity crises and patriarchal oppression this happens when this barbie and ken go to the real world and face the terrible news of the true influence that barbie has had on the lives of girls it is interesting to see how the character played by margot robbie questions her identity and what she reflects to others while ken tries to implement that macho world that she observes in reality in the pink world of barbiethis is how the film revolves around this gender struggle between the kens and the barbies to implement their ideal world finally the barbies regain control of their reality however the stereotypical barbie decides to take on the challenge of being human and face the oppressive reality that the real world representsfinally it is very easy as women to feel identified with what is exposed in the film however barbie falls short in representing the problems suffered by nonwhite and nonnorth american women barbie is a feminist film clearly but white feminism is not something that all women identify with,0.9141,positive

910,lassewoebken,31-Oct-23,"for me the song im just ken was the best part of the movie but the whole movie is great its a great mix of comedy and some serious topics like gender equality with a deeper message  
it shows the problems that all women still have in society but also the problems of the men which is good because i have the feeling that due to the fact that men are paid better and had more rights the society is more focused on the problems of the women in this wolrd and forgets about the mens problems but this movie perfectly shows us that both genders have problems in this unfair world greta gerwig really coocked here",0.9592,positive
911,h-96742,8-Nov-23,we all have an image of perfection and perfection in our minds but barbie tells us from the very beginning that barbie is more than what we usually see she can be a woman of all walks of life and all colors and it catches the audiences attention from the very beginning of the filmthe film gave me a profound sense of shock what moved me at first was the ease with which the characters in the story faced old age after coming to the human world barbie said to the old lady she met for the first time you are so beautiful and the old lady replied i know this is a real compliment a kind of joy in life joy in each of their facesthere is only one heroism in the world and that is to see the truth of life and still love it in the movie barbie barbie is undoubtedly a beautiful and brave existence under her leadership the barbie world finally restored the vitality and vitality of the past however i think the film still has some deficiencies in the portrayal of group images what we can see is that there are many other barbie images in barbie but most of them appear as supporting characters as the aid of classic barbie to promote the development of the story plot perhaps in future films this aspect of the problem can be improved a bit it allows us to see more possibilities and creativity for women,0.9974,positive
912,tangkadsagad,4-Nov-23,dont get me wrong i do love this movie but the thing is i didnt really get the sad hype that people gets from this nonetheless i really enjoyed how the movie talks about a lot of social issues especially the women oppression i recommend this movie if you are really into entertainment and if you just wanna learn and talk about femininity really a hands down for margot robbie on this one she did great on portraying barbie and she looks just so freaking beautiful same goes to other barbies in this movie they are just so breathtaking im not a big fan of the editing they probably did the kiddie editing on purpose but im just not a fan of that ,0.9682,positive
913,lucybartholomew-70332,9-Aug-23,i was really excited to see this movie and i wanted to enjoy it so badly but it really didnt live up to the expectations i should also probably mention that im a young adult and female pretty much the target demographic for this movie im also a huge fan of greta gerwigs projects  this one just doesnt hit the mark sadlyit starts off quite well  the very initial scene is fairly humorous despite us already seeing it in the trailer but it declines pretty quickly theres too much repetition throughout the entire thing for starters the travel montage used to indicate the characters entering barbieland stops being funny around half way through the second roll and was rinsed and repeated so many times that i genuinely cant remember how many times i mustve watched that scene over and over i understand the effort that went into making those individual cuts behindthescenes and did appreciate the organic filmmaking that made them up but it just felt almost too childlike for a film that was clearly pushing to be profound in a more mature contexti came away from the movie nonethewiser as to the point of the mattel ceo was he supposed to be friend foe nobody knows there were no stakes at all involved with barbie getting caught by mattel  what wouldve happened had they put her in the box and with this in mind what kind of world are we dealing with here we know that barbieland is readilyaccessible to humans but there was very little effort in explaining any of this to the audience whilst it sounds pessimistic to say this about any fantasy movie it still just felt weird to watchthere were two particular scenes that i found fairly profound and welldone ferraras characters speech and the flashback scene the music for this movie was brilliant especially what was i made for with the exception of lizzos piece used earlier on which is yet another example of useless repetition i know that this is the point of the scene barbie waking up to have her previouslyperceived perfect day ruined but the song was just downright odd to me and not humorous in the slightest ryan gosling as ken was ironically the best part of the movie for me his singing was great his timing absolutely phenomenal and the dance moves fabulous the cast in general absolutely smashed it as did the makeup wardrobe and set teams behind the magic of barbieland additionally the message is very truetolife and does tackle it well even if barbie still has to apologise to ken in the end when that very much doesnt happen when the roles are reversed in the real worldoverall its okay i wouldnt say its good and i certainly wouldnt recommend anyone to go out of their way to see it i dont think the movie was marketed well at all to that end before anyone thinks  and correctly i might add  that this movie had more marketing than any movie released this year in terms of advertising and numorous brand deals im talking about gerwigs target demographic ive seen a lot of people complaining about the movie being unsuitable for their children and i agree  i was close to leaving around 20 minutes in out of sheer boredom so god knows how a child would feel  but the marketing makes the target demographic very fuzzy indeed i know that the movie is about breaking down stereotypes but most of the children and come to think of it the adults in my showing did not laugh at a good chunk of the humour because it was so poorlytimed or simply not understandable for a child the movie is very overrated and im extremely disappointed that its not what a lot of people were expecting that being said if brand appeal and plots made of empty air is your thing then go for it,0.9941,positive

924,maeshamahmud,26-Jul-23,this movie did a lot of things good and a lot of things badit left me from the theater feeling more emotions than oppenheimer those emotions being anger and frustrationthe movie was aesthetically very precise in the way that it felt like they had a specific vision for it it reminded me a bit of what toy story would look like in live action it leave the audience ponder over the significance of the movie which i have heard a lot there were a lot of moments where the film was heading in the right direction but i felt they havent fully explored those ideas it felt like a waste potential when barbie goes into the real world and sees how women are supposedly treated this is no new concept and feels a bit exaggerate and not addressing the real challenges women face in society i feel we have pass ahead of what was being portrayed the monologue with the mother to the barbies did feel relatable and wish those concepts were explored a bit more than just being repeated againwhen ken brings back patriarchy to barbieland and the barbies take it back by manipulating and tricking the kens felt very cheap what was the message behind that at the end of the movie nothing changed barbie did become a fascist and took over barbieland and were back to square one maybe that was the message that nothing will ever change the ken are to barbieland what women are to the real worldexcept for stereotypical barbie having thoughts of death and cellulite that plotline was then abandoned and never mentioned all the barbies were supposedly perfect and didnt have any flaws which is the point but if you want to portray realistic women why did all the barbies at the end became the same as before there was no progress done there was only weird barbie that felt human since it has bad and good characteristics but it felt like she was only a tour guide than an actual characterperhaps thats the message of the movie that there can be no progress which this movie was really good at getting conversations started since there are so many mixed opinionsthis whole movie also felt like a whole 2hours long commercial on barbie the whole marketing campaign made it feel like you fell in the trap of what this movie was trying to avoid capitalism consumerist society yet the sells for barbie will increasethe monologue with barbie and the creator felt forced like those motivational speeches trying to force the message to the audience instead of thinking and coming to that conclusionthere were more than a few awkward moments that didnt need to be in the movie that felt unnecessarythe casting for barbie was spot on but i would not agree for ken it didnt make sense for ryan gosling to be ken although no complain from the acting obviously but just didnt fit the hair looked awkward and distracting and wasnt a portrayal of the youth kenat the end i think its also a huge generalization and dont know if this is the right movie for feminism and equality i expected more from this movie,-0.9374,negative

927,bcbcqt,23-Jul-23,while the barbie movie delivers a range of colorful and diverse visuals casting and thematic concepts it just fell short for me in the way of substance and execution leaving me wanting morethe physical makeup of the barbie movie is most definitely a strong suit within the film the set pieces environments and outfits are all adequately colorful visually pleasing and reminiscent of early 90s to 00s barbie marketing the colorful cast of both recognizable and lesser known actors creates a diverse character list which is relatively cohesive with the overall plots the character designs feel unique and refreshing while also remaining recognizable throughout the sets and props feel whimsical and fun while also providing purpose and interesting context they honestly created barbieland perfectly and are able to include clever visual jokes and references however it can occasionally feel a little random or on the nose like theyre just waiting for middle aged women in the audience to go oh my god i had that when i was a kid its barbie marketing genius but it may get old after some time however barbies plot this is where barbie fell short for me it feels like directors of the movie spent a significant amount of time shoveling money into the visuals and immense amount of marketing for this movie and with three months left they scrambled to put together a plot for the cast and set pieces there are multiple plots strung together very loosely that feel disjointed because of this none of the thematic concepts are explored adequately and its difficult to feel much of anything for any one of the characters character development happens very quickly and anytime we think were going to receive a more complex character their facade melts and they are revealed to be a relatively one sided representation of a specific idea or character role barbie the naive stereotypical perfectionist who developed depth after very quickly coming to terms with change and her own mortality ken the weak insecure man reliant on a woman who develops a sigma facade to stick it to the women controlling his life  but in actuality he is wounded from her rejection the mother shes a mom she has a teenage daughter who she has trouble connecting with where have i heard this before the daughter a onesided representation of a woke teenager whos angst is never explored outside of shes just a moody teenager  despite this it is still an integral plot line that is never developed we are never shown the daughters transition or possible trauma leading to her developing hatred for her extremely caring and loving parents all of this is constantly being shoved down our throats none of the character development or themes are very subtle instead opting for explicit mentions of gender roles patriarchy fascism political correctness and aloof representations of men in power while these are all great concepts to explore they are all tackled simultaneously and thus executed poorly in an attempt to avoid confusion i assume these concepts are constantly and directly shown to audience members  even with ken literally learning the definition of a patriarchy in the library and having that be his motivator for the rest of the film this easily victimizes women and strips male characters of any and all complexity  reducing them to caricaturas lacking any real substance there were a few times where the cinematography gave the plot a moment of fresh air adding scenic and thematic complexity such as when barbie first looks around in the real world and sees others experiencing human emotion before accepting the duality of happiness and pain as a part of organic psychology however these moments are often overshadowed by reverting character arcs or other themes deemed to momentarily be more important all in all barbie offers a fun story attempting introspection in multiple parts but falls short in its execution of those deeper concepts and ideas instead opting for cinematic multitasking of the highest degree many scenes dont make very much sense or contribute to the plot but it does still offer a nostalgic exploration of childhood growing up and humanity admittedly it does have a pretty great soundtrack billies song may have brought a tear to my eye despite me not caring about barbies sudden want to become human but thats because of that falsetto wow  and ice spice and nikis rendition of aquas barbie girl had both me and my boyfriend wanting to buss a move out of the theatre,0.9887,positive

barbie is an objectively good movie when you consider its aspects as a film the set design is amazing in the barbie world and this combined with the amazing wardrobe really makes you feel like this world actually could exist these two things are a real standout for me and is everything you could hope for from a barbie movie margot robbie and ryan gosling play an amazing barbie and ken something i did not expect was how much i liked michael ceras performance as allan i feel like his performance gave the film as sense of awkward relief which i enjoyed although i touch on why i really didnt like the storytelling aspect of barbie in the negatives section i do like how the film builds this metaphor between the relationship of barbies and kens and the relationship of men and womennegatives
barbie is movie where you are not allowed to think for yourself one of my favorite aspects about storytelling is its ability to communicate a message in disarming ways the type of movie where you buy into the message either implicitly or explicitly through exposition of the characters struggles movies that forgo this buy in from the audience are more or less just preaching an idea rather than trying to convince or demonstrate an idea this is really where i have problems with the barbie movie while the causes pushed for in the movie are noble they are so inelegant and on the nose it really does feel like you are being talked at through the entire movie i cannot tell you a single theme subtext or message that the movie was trying to convey that wasnt also explicitly conveyed in dialogue between the characters consider something like the dialogue between barbie and ken after the barbies stopped the kens from changing the constitution after ken returned from the human world with his new idea of patriarchy in this dialogue is the only way to convey the idea of not defining your self worth based on others andor your material possessions is by barbie saying almost exactly that but in not so few words are the characters so superficial that any attempt to demonstrate that point through self reflection andor actions would just completely fall flat this is not an isolate incident either i would challenge anybody to find either a theme subtext or any socialpolitical statement that they movie tries to convey that isnt in some dialogue somewhere where it is almost explicitly stated as such this issue really makes the movie feel shallow and superficial and uninteresting to watch after a certain point",0.9788,positive
930,Kallimachos7,26-Jul-23,i would like to start by saying that ryan gosling delivers an impressive performance as ken truly standing out in the film with his remarkable portrayal however the movie doesnt quite meet the marketed expectations opting for a more adult satirical and metacommentary approach instead of the anticipated lighthearted comedy which may make it less enjoyable for some who were expecting different things  the visuals and humor can be excessive at times possibly detracting from the overall experience additionally the movies direct handling of its message  while thoughtprovoking might polarize viewers,0.9653,positive

939,danielaelizabeth-59734,6-Aug-23,some things were super clever and made me laugh ryan goslings ken was awesomehe was the best part there were definitely elements i appreciated and i thought were thought provoking however it just felt so political and so forced it was a huge social commentary which i think can be great but it wasnt seamlessly blended it it was kinda obnoxious and redundant plot was sometimes boring and the storyline about real world meets fake world felt a little bit cliche certain moments were just too corny did i laugh though definitely it had its moments i agree with the high highs and low lows statements,0.8796,positive
940,mary_blondie,8-Aug-23,for sure it failed to achieve feminism or be a criticism to patriarchy but what to expect from barbie and mattel unfortunately in my opinion the movie did the exact opposite thing setting the standards and the stereotypes for women in a non realistic level although margot robbie was delightful to watch very classy and beautiful perfectly representing barbie the general movie vibe could be a lot more fun so as to have a meaning watching it it should last 30 minutes less in duration and doesnt worth the hype i am glad i saw it so as to have an opinion but it is nothing more that a typical light meaningless movie,0.9736,positive
